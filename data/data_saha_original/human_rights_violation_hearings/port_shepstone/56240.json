I was there, and we also had a helper who was working.  She was just coming to help me in the fields at around 10 in the morning.  I heard the telephone ring and I got hold of the telephone.  I spoke through and those were the colleagues at work.  They said they don't see him, where is he?  The last time they saw him it was Thursday.

I received the telephone and they said he was not around.  After a few minutes, as I was relaxing - I had said to those whom I said they shall go and look for him in the location, I asked them to call me back, but they never called me back.  After some time, after one, my sister, who was working at the hospital in Murchison came, and I told her the story and she said to me she will go and ask for permission from the hospital and go and look at the location, especially that Bhekani was also there.  My sister left, went to the hospital and asked for permission to leave, and she went to Harding.  When she got there she found Bhekani, and Bhekani apparently was coming back home to tell us, to give us the report that the father was missing.  After quite some time they came, my sister and Bhekani.  They told me that they cannot locate Memela.  Even at work he's not known and he's not there.  After some time my parents came, the Nzimande family, to find out what was happening.  In the morning of Saturday we came back and hired a kombi and we went to Harding.  When we got to Harding we went to the mortuary.  We could not find him.  We went to the courts, we could not find him.  We went to the police, we could not find him, and they promised to help us search for him.  On Sunday afternoon -because he went missing on Thursday, then on Sunday afternoon we had heard nothing.  Bhekani said to me, \"Mum, let's just go and find out from the people.  The people in the neighbourhood probably could help us and tell us the whereabouts of my father.\"  And as we were leaving the house the telephone rang, and we quickly ran back to get the telephone.  The telephone message told us to go to Harding, and when we went to Harding, when we arrived in Harding they said, \"Memela is in the mortuary, but you are not allowed to see him, the way he is so brutally injured.\"  Truly we stayed in Harding, and after some time we left, we went back home and reported the matter that Memela has left us, has died.  And at Harding it was said that he cannot be kept for quite some time in the mortuary because he was brutally injured.  (Pause)  ",

It was dark, and you can imagine one is knocking and we were there sitting.  Yes it was my sister-in-law, and she came in and asked, \"Where is Bhekani?\"  I said to him, \"He had left with a group of young men, telling me that they were taking some money to Madlala.\"  He said, \"There were some shootings around that house, and it looks like Bhekani was also there.  Some others ran away, but it looks like Bhekani was affected.  Where is he?\"  Then one said, \"Just call to Mbanjwa.\"  We called Mbanjwa's place, asking where were the boys.  Yes, the boys were there already.  And we called Mbambo's place and they said Mbambo's boy was there already.  And then I asked around, \"What should I do now because Bhekani is not yet back, especially after those ",

They were asking whether Xolani is at home, and one of my children said, \"I am still going to look for him,\" and then later he came back to say he is not around at home.  And then they told us that we should go to the mountain to search.  When I get out they told me that I should take a blanket, and then I went back to the house to get a blanket.  And I thought maybe something bad has happened.  I took out a bath and poured some water to wash.  I took this blanket and followed the other people as they were running towards the mountain.  When I arrived at the scene I realised that my son was lying on the ground and he was dead.  I tried to turn him and took off his shoes.  The others said I must sit down, and the people started arriving.  While I was sitting on the ground my brother-in-law went to call the police.  He was accompanied by other men whom I don't remember.  People were crying, but I was confused, I wasn't even crying.  When the police arrived my brother-in-law was just walking around picking some cartridges on the ground where he was killed, and then he showed these cartridges to a policeman by the name of Khumalo, but he said these would not assist them because they don't have the numbers.  The policeman called the young boys who were standing by and he asked them where were they from together with Xolani, and they told him that they went to attend a meeting, an ANC meeting in that area.  They said while they were coming back from the meeting they were shot.  It was becoming dark and they couldn't see the person who was shooting at them.  They were just chanting and going home.  \"We scattered at the time of the shooting and we didn't know where the others ran to.  We ran to our homes and we didn't know that Xolani has been shot dead.  We just heard the next morning when he was found that he was shot dead.\"  The police took the body away and we went back home.  Then we started calling relatives to tell them about the death.  The first one to call was Sipho Vezi and other people.  Then they came back home and we started making preparations for the funeral.  That was on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Then on Thursday my brother said they were going to the meeting with ANC where they will arrange for police to come and guard the house during the funeral because we are afraid.  Then on the day of the funeral they brought the cops back.  After the funeral there were many people.  There were children from different schools.  They came with buses.  There were so many people.  As I said, after the funeral my brother-in-law, Sipho, took his in-laws into a car to take them back home because it was late.  He took his child who was three years old.  It took a long time and he didn't come back, and we were starting to worry as to what had happened to him.  As we were sitting down confused, not knowing what was happening, some people came running to report that there had been some shooting.  We get confused because he didn't come back.  Then another person came to tell us Sipho has been shot, and we asked who shot him.  They said he has been shot by Chief Kawulengweni Mkhize.  He was accompanied by his brother and his son.  We asked what happened when he was shot.  He asked the attackers what he had done.  They just followed him and shot him, and he fall on the road, and they came back and stabbed him with some spears.  When we asked whether he was dead they refused to tell the truth, saying that he didn't did, but that was a lie because he really died.  And we asked where is the little child.  One of my brothers-in-law started running towards the place.  We heard that Sipho's wife was travelling in another car.  After Sipho's wife had arrived they just discovered that Sipho is dead and he was lying on the road.  After that time we heard that the other one has been killed too.",

At about half past two in the evening we asked people to take us by their cars out of the place, and people refused to take us and they said we have to come to the road to get the car.  But it was difficult to get there because we have to pass the place where Sipho was killed.  While we were still sitting there we heard a group of people singing the Inkatha songs.  This was an Inkatha stronghold, and we have already heard that they were coming to burn us.  We got out of the house together with my mother-in-law and my husband, and my husband was very confused at the time, and we started running away.  We couldn't even lock the houses, we were just holding a lamp and we were running away.  We didn't know which way to take.  We ran up the hill and we decided to go to my family where I were born.  We didn't know how to reach the place, we just have to run up the hill, and these people could see us running.  When they arrived at home they could see that there was no longer anybody there, they could only see the stock and the houses, and when they looked up the hill they could see us, and they were shouting, \"There are the people we are looking for.\"  And we continued to run.  They ran so fast I got so tired I sit down.  They waited for me, but I catch up with them.  We started running and get into the bushes.  We get inside, there was mud, and we hide there.  Then we heard a car passing.  We ran out of the bushes and went to another place.  We were running through the bushes, we couldn't use the roads or the paths.  And then we ran to the family, where we didn't use the gate, we have to come from the back yard to get into the house and hide.  ",

We didn't know whether he was still alive or not, but it happened that he arrived, and he said to us our house is burning.  He said when he reached to a neighbour's house he was told that we ran away, and he was told that he must also run away because the people are coming to search for our relatives, so they might find him.  Therefore he started running, following us.  At home my father tried to arrange a transport for us to run away, but most of the people refused to give us their cars.

And then the young child started crying, saying, \"My daddy's coming,\" and then \"I want to go with you, Daddy.\"  And then my husband said, \"Bring him in,\" and then they took the child with them.  We sat at home waiting for him to come and pick the others back to their homes, but he never returned and we got so worried.  Later one gentleman came - I don't remember his surname - and he said there has been some shooting up there.  He said some went down the slopes.  We were so confused because Sipho went to the same direction.  After some few minutes someone again came to say that Sipho has been shot.  They said he was shot next to the chief's place, and we asked who shot him.  He said the chief was also there.  I was so afraid and confused, then I started running towards the direction of the chief's place.  When I arrived at the road I stand trying to stop the cars.  The cars didn't stop and I started walking on foot.  Another car came and I tried to stop it, and he asked me where I am going and I told the driver that, \"I heard there's been some shooting, I am just going to investigate,\" and the man said, \"No, go back.  I will go and investigate myself.\"  And I said to him, \"Look, there is my child in the car.  I have to go.\"  And he said to me, \"Okay, you can come in.\"  And I got into the car and we started moving.  When we arrived at the scene there were so many people who were singing.  There was noises, this kind of violent noises.  When we were about to reach the chief's shop I said to the driver, \"There is Sipho.\"  I could see his body lying on the road.  And then he said, \"We mustn't stop then.  We have to pass,\" and I said to him, \"No, we have to.  I have to go to him.\"  And he said, \"No, we have to go to the police first.\"  We got off and there were police at the moment at the scene.  There was an ambulance.  People were moving up and down and everything.  It was just confused situation.  He insisted that we should first go to the police to escort us to this place.  Then we went to the police.  We asked them that, \"We are looking for a gentleman who was driving on that car which have just overturned, it was the car that was overturned.\"  And the police said, \"No, okay, we'll try and look for you.\"  They left the place.  Just as they left we heard two gunshots.  I became so afraid, and the driver said, \"Don't be afraid.  The police are around, they won't shoot us.\"  We waited, and the police came back to say that there is no young child there.  At that time we could see people running as if they were sort of running after someone, and they were coming towards our direction.  They were making noise, someone saying like, \"I have been defeated by someone.  Someone has defeated me.\"  It looked as if they were following someone, but we couldn't see the person.  They passed us and the chief was in their company.  This driver asked the chief's brother, and he asked them respectfully, \"The Honourable, we would",

Do you know exactly where the child is?\"  They said to us, \"Go and look for the child somewhere at the shop.\"  Then we asked the police to escort us back to the crowd.  It was becoming late and dark.  We went to the direction of the shop, and when we arrived we stopped and parked the car.  I got off the car.  I knew the place because I was staying there, and I know most of the people who were at the shop, and one gentleman by the name of Cele came to me.  He said, \"You mustn't make noise,\" as I was shouting, asking for my child.  And he said to me, \"You keep quiet, shut up, you're making noise here.\"  He pulled out something like a knobkerrie.  He acted as if he wanted to hit me with this knobkerrie and I ran back to the car.  And the driver of the car said, \"No, what are we going to do?\" and he started the engine of the car and we wanted to run away, and then someone advised us not to run away because they are going to shoot at us.  And the chief came back and he asked us, \"What's happening?  What do you want here?\"  The driver explained that, \"I am with my neighbour and we are looking for a child.\"  The chief said, \"Come and take the child.\"  No, first he asked us where are we coming from, what's our surname, and we told him from the Vezi family, and he said, \"Which Vezi?\"  I kept quiet, and he said, \"Who is your father?\" and I said, \"My father is Mathewu,\" and he said, \"Come.\"  I told him, \"I am afraid,\" and he said, \"Come, they won't do anything to you,\" and in the company of the chief we went up the stairs in his shop.  When I arrived I found my daughter, and she was asking, \"Where is my father?\"  My child was in the company of one lady, and I took my child from this lady.  The chief accompanied us, and I said to the chief, \"He was with his father.  Where is his father?\" and the chief said to me, \"We have shot that one.\"  Those are the words from the chief's mouth.  We got out and he said to me, \"Your child is clever.\"  I said, \"Thank you,\" and he said to me, \"Then listen to me.  You must go and tell your relatives that I don't want them in my place.  If they don't go away I am going to burn them.  They have to leave my place.\"  I went back into the car and we drove back home.  When I arrived at home I explained to them what happened.  They couldn't believe it.  They said, \"This cannot happen.\"  My brothers went to Highflats at that night.  When they arrived there they were told that Sipho's body has been taken to the mortuary.  We stayed at home and some relatives started arriving, and they couldn't believe the chief's words.  They said, \"They can't do such a thing.  They can't burn these houses.  They have already killed someone.  How they come and burn our houses?\"  We stayed at our home until Sunday.  The situation was bad.  I told them, \"I think we should go to Umlazi at my place.\"  Unfortunately the elder people didn't believe that anything could happen so they insisted that we stay, and we stayed until the evening.  In the evening then we got some messages that the chief is coming to kill us, and then we decided to look for a car to leave the place.  We sat their waiting.",

He spent about two weeks at the mortuary because we didn't have a place to bury him.  All this troubled me.  We started preparation for the funeral and we find a place at Mariannhill, and we had to go to Ixopo to fetch the deceased, and he was buried at Mariannhill, and a case was opened at Highflats.  The first hearing of the case was at Ixopo.  We went to Ixopo.  The way the people in the company of the chief were treating us was so horrible.  On the first hearing we were told that the case would be postponed and we would be told when to come back to court.  During 1991, in that year, we didn't know what was happening, everything just got quiet, until 1993 January we got a message that the case will be heard at Scottburgh Court.  We went to Scottburgh.  At that time I was at school and studying.  I was doing my final year doing a teaching diploma.  I went to college during 1992.  In 1993 I was doing my third year.  And we were told that the first hearing will be on the 2nd of February.  We attended the case.  We were badly treated in court by the IFP people, and that is still something that I can't forget. And they insulted us and called us by different names, and they used to say I mustn't get into to court, I have to stay outside.  And then the case just finished like that.  I didn't know what happened.  And it was decided on the 17th of February.  We used to go to court every day.  Somewhere on the 8th - someone who was traumatised by this matter was Sipho's mother, and she died at the time at home, and there was nobody at the time of her death at home.  We were not at home because we went to court for the hearing, and when we came back we were told that our mother has passed away.",

When I had to go back to school I was confused, and the rector had to release me, saying I must go back home, I mustn't study during that year, and I have to stay for a year out of school.  During 1993 I couldn't go to school and I couldn't work, and I had to go back to school during 1994.  I can say that's the end of this traumatic story.",

They said, \"We won't bring the certificate to you, you must come and pick it up.\"  Unfortunately we are afraid to go because we have to go via the place where we were attacked, and we asked them to meet us halfway so that we can meet on the way so they can give us the certificate.

            "We want to thank you both very, very much for coming in today to tell us this very, very sad and tragic story about the death of your son and the death of your husband.  It's a shocking thing that that happened, that after your son was killed that somebody who attended the funeral, somebody who was assisting with funeral-goers, should himself also have been shot.  And this is a theme that we have seen all over this country, where people have died in political violence, or as a result of assassinations, and at their funeral, which should be a time for quietness and mourning, and for people to be together, a time when they should be respected, it often has happened that they have been attacked at those funerals, and even the funeral-goers themselves have been killed.  And this is what happened to your husband, and it's a terrible thing that people are able to do this to each other, that there is such disrespect for human life, and such hate, and that there are such high levels of political intolerance in our community.  And in many parts of this province, of course, that has not changed, and we think of the victims of the Shobani massacre, who cannot come to this Commission because that happened beyond 1993.  And we think of the people who died in massacres recently in Donnybrook, and we realise that there are still very powerful forces in this province of people do not want reconciliation at all, but people who want total political domination.  And when we hear stories like yours it should make us all the more determined that these sorts of things should never ever happen again.  So you have both given us a very clear picture of what life was like in those days, and we hope that you have got some strength and support from each other by the fact that you have been able to give your story together on the stage.  You've heard my colleague, Dr Magwaza, saying that people like you really should seek psychological assistance, and if you want assistance in that regard you can contact the Commission, and we will be able to point you in the right direction and to assist you with that.  So once again we thank you very, very much for coming and having the courage to share your story with us today.  Thank you very much.",

It's very difficult for us to understand that, but we have heard so many stories like that.  We express our deep sympathy to you and your wife.  You have lost your greatest asset, your house, your greatest physical asset, and you have lost another asset in that your child has also been killed, has been taken from you,  and instead of being able to relax in your retirement in your home with your children around you you are now forced to rent a house.  You said in your statement that you are paying R340,00 a month for the rent of the house out of a pension of R410,00 a month, and it's very sad that at this stage of your life you should be placed in that position.  We will try and investigate why those people weren't charged, the two people that you have mentioned.  We will try and follow that up, and we will also be making recommendations to the Government as to how you, and other people like you, who have been so badly dealt with, how you should be assisted, and we will be making those recommendations to the President.

I organised the youth, telling them that they should form church choirs.  And it happened like that, they used to come to sing these choruses.  Then on Thursday it was the appointed day on which we had to leave to Ulundi.  And the youth have to go back to their homes on Thursday, they had to come back on Friday.  And they started preparing their song.  This means that they were to leave the place to Ulundi on Friday, not Thursday.  While the youth were busy rehearsing their songs one of my younger daughters - I think at that time she was about 12 years old - the others asked her, they wanted her to accompany them because she has a good voice, so they wanted to accompany her in the rehearsals.

Your descriptions of this happy group of young people, eagerly waiting to go on their journey, being killed by guns, those visions will live with us for a long time, and we should ask ourselves what did that violence achieve?  What it achieved is that it destroyed at least 12 families, it made people bitter, it made them sad, and it left them with awful memories that  will never leave them.  And the evidence that we have heard today from both members of the ANC and members of Inkatha has been very similar.  It's been about the killing of innocent people.  And we are very glad that you and the other people from the IFP were here today to listen to the members of the ANC and their families giving their stories about how they suffered, and we are very glad that they were here today to listen to how you suffered.  Both of you, both groups, know that the only thing that this violence has brought to you is grief and tears and a sense of loss, and we hope that this experience of sitting here and sharing this together will bring about an understanding, a mutual understanding of how useless the violence is, and that this understanding will maybe bring you together, and that it will help to promote reconciliation in our province.",

So we do have some idea of what you are experiencing and what you are going through, and we will certainly do everything that we can to get the bottom of this.  I recall the Operation Vula incident when it took place, and I recall the two people who disappeared, one of whom now we understand is your husband.  And it is absolutely essential that we get to the bottom of what happened to these people and where they are buried, and I am sure once you know that you will have a sense of - some sense of relief, rather than not to know at all where he is and where he died and how he died.  You heard my colleague, Dr Mgojo, say that our job is to make recommendations to the Government as to how people like you should be assisted.  You have lost your husband, who was the breadwinner, joint breadwinner of your family, and he has left behind you and three small children.

I have already heard from the other one, he said he wanted pension.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with that, but you are still very young.  If you were to be sent back to school, because you are still young, now there are many ways of going back to school, I mean many ways of learning.  You cannot be going - I mean education is not the book, but you can also learn some skills.  You are still very young for pension.  Why don't you ask something in this regard?  ",

What are you saying?  I am trying to put you in a condition where you will be helpful to your families, because you are very young, so be clear, talk out.  What is it that you are saying?  We do trust and hope that we could help you, and as you were harassed, and you are still very young at the same time.  The other one already has asked for some help that he wants to go back and learn something, gain some skills, and what about you?  That's the very question I am asking you.  Then talk up.   ---   Well, I think I will also appreciate the very same thing he has said, because I am not working, I am just home. ",

            "Sithembiso, Thembinkosi, Kayiya, we thank you very, very much for coming in today.  We are glad that you could be here together.  You suffered together, and it is very good that now that that period of harassment is over that you can share your experience here before the Truth Commission.  You have been here today the whole day, and you will have heard most of the stories that have been told.  Most of those stories have been about specific incidents which took place on a specific day, whereas you have all given us a description of life over a period of a year, or more than a year.  1991/1992.  You have told us what it was like to live in that area of Murchison for a long, long time, and it's given us a very clear idea of what life was like there.  You have also named the names of a policeman whose name has come up many times from other witnesses, Major Fourie.  His name has been mentioned by other people, and from what you have told us it seems that he, Major Fourie and his fellow officers, in co-operation with certain local IFP members, set out to destabilise that area of Murchison in order to prevent and discourage any political activity in that area which was critical of the Government or was opposed to the Government.  And this action of theirs, this coalition between the police and certain Inkatha members, caused very extensive disruption in Murchison, as it did in many other areas, and it cause many hundreds of people to flee their homes.  And, as we have heard, many people also lost their lives.  And you are amongst those who had to flee from Murchison to other areas.  So, as I have said, you have given us a very clear picture of what life was like in those days, and when we write our report, as I have said to earlier witnesses, you can be sure that the people of Murchison and their stories will feature in that report.\nYou have also made certain requests to us in response to Dr Mgojo's question, and we will be making recommendations to the Government as to how we think that you could be assisted.  So again thank you very much for coming in and explaining your stories to us.  Thank you very much.",
