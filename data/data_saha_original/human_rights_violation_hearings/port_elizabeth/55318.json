On the evening of Wednesday, at one o'clock my husband was not sleeping at the house because he was afraid of being arrest.\n On that particular night he was at home and then at one o'clock in the morning we heard a car stopping outside and we woke up.  He went to the window and peeped and I also peeped.\n Then he asked whose car is this and then I said I don't know because it is a state of emergency, so we just ignored it, but the car didn't stop directly in front of our gate, diagonally opposite and then we went to sleep again and then on Thursday, the following morning and then about at the same time on Thursday now, and I was alone on that particular night, I heard a kombi stopping outside and then I looked through the window and found that it was the same kombi.\n And I couldn't sleep, I was scared, I was just laying on my bed because my kids were still very small, my three kids were still very small.  The older one was not at home, he was serving a prison sentence in Mntansane and I was scared and sleepless.\n About 15 minutes later after hearing this I heard a knock on my door and the doors were being banged, kicked and the windows and then my light was not off, so I braised it and then the Boers were shouting at me to open and then I went to open and then my third child and the two younger\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 AE MAGWACA\nones and a friend of his from the street, were sleeping in the other room and these police came in together with this Black policeman.\n And when they came in this first Boer asked where is Lamla, where is Popi and we want Lamla, we want Popi and Lamla because your child is very good at making petrol bombs.\n I said I didn't know where they were, because they were not at home.  And the Black policeman said how could I say I didn't know, I said no, they don't tell me when they go, they never tell me when they go.\n And then they pushed me around and pushed me and I would fall and get up and then they would ask me to dress up.  They said I will have to tell them where my husband was, I told them I didn't know.  And then they said Lamla is a member of a political organisation as a comrade, I must tell them.\n They were turning everything upside down and took away our photo's next to the phone and some of them, I still had a phone, which was also taken away at that same time.  They took some photographs and they were searching and they took an album.  Every picture of my husband was taken away and they asked me to dress.\n I didn't want to put on my clothes, but I was getting cold and my body was aching because they were throwing me down.",

Towards five in the morning, if I remember correctly, he got up.  Popi\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 W BILLIE\nMagwaca got up and he said he was going home just to check what the situation was at home.\n Indeed, Magwaca went, Popi Magwaca went, he said he was not going to stay, he was going to come back very soon, he wouldn't take long.  He would come and tell us what was going on.\n Indeed we waited for him.  At about six Sipho Futwa came and said to us you know whilst you guys are sitting here, people are being arrested outside by the Boers.  So I advise you to see what you can do, but don't stay here.  And so he left because he was rushing to work, because he was working at the time.\n We decided quite quickly that this, we wondered why this man was taking so long to return, because he had promised to come back quickly and suddenly thereafter we left to check what was happening as he said he was just going to check on the situation.\n Indeed we found him at his place, he was drinking a cup of tea and his wife, next to me here, was there.
