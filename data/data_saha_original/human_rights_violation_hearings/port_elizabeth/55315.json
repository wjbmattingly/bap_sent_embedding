He did go, I knew that he would come together here at Centenary Hall.  I think it was \nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 NL GANGCA\nat four, between four and five, it was in summer, so it was still not yet sunset.\n Somebody called me out and said I must come and look because Monde was being attacked by the AZAPO.  I went to the spot, when I came there, I was informed that he was taken to hospital.  I went to the police station to give a statement, they asked me with whom am I staying.  I stated that I was staying with my mother and Monde himself.\n My wife was at the church at the time.  They told me to go to their mortuary.  I saw him and I could identify him.  I was very angry because he was hacked.  There was a gashing wound on the head.\n I wanted to confirm and make sure so I opened it because I wanted to see the extent of the injuries.  He was hacked on the chest, the ribs were also chopped. I also took - I went back home and took my axe and I wanted to challenge those who had attacked my brother.\n In the mean time I was expected to go to the police station again after a day or two, I was prepared to revenge the death of my brother.  The police wanted to arrest me because they said I must not take the law into my hands.\n I waited for quite a long time, but nothing happened.  Whilst I was staying, I learnt information that they were threatening to attack me also - these members of AZAPO.\n I was informed by some of my friends that they were looking into the matter and they were going to attack me.",
