He didn't escape, he left because we were taking part in the same struggle and he did tell me he was going to fight for the nation.  I gave him the permission although I was a bit apprehensive.\n And I said to him, Mbulelo my wish for you is to continue with your education, because at the time he was studying at Kwazakhele Senior Secondary school where he was a member of COSAS.  He left at that stage of his activity and he went to Lesotho.\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 MN NGONGO\n In Lesotho they spent a year before they went for training, after which they went for training to whatever states they went to.  On their return ... (tape starts) ...  he was not in the first 41, then the other 9 fell that and we went to bury those victims.\n That's when I met him with his comrades like Atwell Maqekeza,  Tandofiqa Radebe, but Tandofiqa Radebe was a student there.

He was a (indistinct), he was from training, he was now operational, he was going to be operating this side and when I got there, they looked for me and we talked and I established contact with him and we had some working relationship and we did things together.\n What I mean is I was underground with them, I was operating underground.  When they came, they would come and meet me, but what happened was in 1988, the story is very long, but I am going to summarise it, shorten it.  In 1988 I got a phone call.\n I was no longer staying at my house because of harassment.  And then I was bothered by this phone, but I took this phone, just to listen what was happening.  So I said, when they said, you have a phone, I took the call and the person who answered the phone, I said what sort of person is, and then I was described.\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 MN NGONGO\n When I heard the name, I recognised the name, it was Atwell Maqekeza, before he fell.\n He said mother, I want to tell you, just want to find out what things are on your side because the Boers are on us this side and he said, I told him, no things are bad even here.  I no longer stay at home.  And I had already sounded other people to change their places of abode because - which we know.  I said Glamluli Tsojzi cave the message that they should shift from their residence and they did change their residence.\n But after all that it didn't help, didn't help because Mbulelo was there with Maqekeza, they were travelling to Mafeking in Lesotho, the three of them and Tandofiqa Radebe.  That's where they got into a roadblock as the story goes, I wasn't there, I just got the story.\n At this roadblock they were stopped.  These people tried to speak to them, and actually tried to convince these people that they were trying to beg for mercy and he pleaded but it didn't help, these people were wearing masks.\n Mbulelo saw one policeman was hitting Radebe and Mbulelo ran away.  Then they went for Atwell Maqekeza and he fell down, Mbulelo had run away.  So he went to tell his other friends who were not there that our comrades had fallen, this is what happened in a roadblock.\n The following morning his comrades went to check to look, then they found the body of Tandofiqa and not that of Atwell.  They looked for it and looked for it until they found it in the mealie lands.  He was still living and they took him to a hospital in Maseru.\n Atwell didn't want to stay in this hospital, but there was nothing they could do because  his leg was very severely\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 MN NGONGO\ndamaged, then came a call to me and I could hear that there were many people.  Many people because there were some noise in the background.  I had suspected that it could have been  Atwell, but people didn't let me take the phone.\n At that hospital his bed was close to a window, then someone came and shot Maqekeza, then Mbulelo - he was with a lady at Roma, I think that is where he went and relax.  These people are laughing at me, you know everyone has somewhere where he goes to relax.\n Four men came and they wanted to ask him who he was and he said he was a student at Roma University and they argued over this and this four, these three were about to give up.  It was the fourth one who was clearly a Xhosa, he said you are Mbulelo Ngongo from PE and there was no way he could then deny it and then they took him away and they asked this girl to remain behind, they said they would come back for her.\n I suspect that they were taking him to where he was staying.

They took her to Roma police station where Lindialoma was dropped and Mbulelo was taken away.  Lindialoma stayed for two days at that police station.\n She never met Mbulelo again.  Lindialoma doesn't know these police when I asked her because I did try to arrange for her to come here to tell me what had happened, but when I asked her, she just said I just saw from their badges and then I took their names, that's how I kept their names.\n On the second day I was released, but then I asked about Mbulelo on my release, about his whereabouts.  They said you can go look for him at all the police stations, so she did that, went to all the police stations in Lesotho and they didn't know anything about him.  They would show her the records and she wouldn't find his name.\n So she returned to the residence at the university.  She says from her side, that is as far as she could say anything about Mbulelo, so I went to a lawyer because I was phoned to go to some people who worked with him, phoned me to say I should go to a lawyer in Durban.

And I left the hotel, rushed to the township and then I phoned, told him Qoinzamlaba that I left the hotel because of the article, but Qoinzamlaba was happy with that decision, so I said to him what shall I do?  These people have been arrested and they will not be able to hide my name because I am their link and they will be hit and they will be forced to confess, so he said I must cross.\n So I said no I couldn't leave the country because my son was still very small, I said no I must go back to Port Elizabeth to fetch my young child so that I could live with him.  So I came back, I said to Qoinzamlaba I am going home now.\n So I phoned PE, I asked one young chap how things were and this young man said, no, you better not come, just wait there.  So I didn't say I would come, so I phoned another house and I called another young man, whose son was surprised at my call and asked - wanted to know who I was?\n This man said she is not here, Zakhikele is not here, \nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 MN NGONGO\nthen I was sure that they were arrested.  So I said to the lawyer, I want to go home.  If I go home today, then I am going to get there and go to the Council of Churches.  I will report to the Council of Churches.  If I haven't done that, then you must know that I have been arrested, then you should please help with my child, with Mbulelo and please do follow up this case.\n Then his story about Mbulelo was that when he got  instructions from Lesotho to follow up this case, he looked at the case and he was trying to investigate.  Then after some time he found that it was very difficult and then one day someone came, someone unknown came to his office and Qoinzamlaba didn't want to leave the office and go and meet this person, but eventually he said he went out to see this person outside in the passage and he met this young man and this young man said I am Kaykay, I am not in detention.\n Kaykay is this Mbulelo, that was his name, MK name, he said I am not in detention.  Then I looked at this man, I said no, I said can you describe this person and I had a photo of Mbulelo, I said, now describe this Kaykay.  Qoinzamlaba described this person.  He said this person is thickly set, lightish in complexion.\n I had the photo, Mbulelo's photo, I said is it the same as this person, he said no, it is not this person.  I said no this is my son.  He said no, I tried to confirm in Lesotho, I described this person to the cadres in Lesotho and they said no, that's not Mbulelo.\n It was clear that it was part of the strategy of the Boers that was what Qoinzamlaba was saying, but he said he would follow up this case.  I've been to Booi, because that is another lawyer here.  Attorney Booi this side, Booi\nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 MN NGONGO\nMajudina.\n So I said to Qoinzamlaba, I am going home.  I just want to emphasise that you go ahead with this case, even if you don't see me but when you ever think of me think of this case, because if ever I am arrested, I have no hope that I will survive because these Boers have long been looking for me.\n So I left Durban, they took me to the station, taken by Qoinzamlaba's wife.  At the station something happened which was a clear indication that they were looking for me.  They asked for our passports, yet normally no passports are asked for at the station, so when this happened, I realised but I was prepared, I had a fake passport with me.\n But the Commission here, she is trying to stop me, she thinks I am deviating.  I was having a fake passport and then I produced this to this bus people and they looked at it and then they let me in until I got to PE, but then it is your day, it is your day because I just spent one night.\n This one is in Lesotho, there are things that I may miss, that's why I wanted her to be here.  So I came in PE, spent a night, the following morning I felt like, let me go to this labour issue, because that same morning the phone cam again.\n Mr Nebe was the one who was working with my husband, because my husband used to work there before he died.  So I was hopeful because maybe they were calling me.  I was hopeful that he was going to do something for me, because my husband was his former colleague.\n And that's what he was saying on the phone also to my daughter who used to answer the phone, so I decided I was going to - so I said to my daughter, let's go and my \nPORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 MN NGONGO\ndaughter said, no, I am scared.  So I said, okay, I will go alone.\n So I went to the labour office.  When I got there I looked for this man, he was exited when he saw me.  Oh, Mrs Ngongo, we've been waiting for you, what's, why did you disappear for so long?  Take a seat here and then I said at this labour office and he told me stories and then one Boer came, Vorster, that is his name.\n He also came to confirm that it was me.  Another Boer was working with my husband, ran away.  I got suspicious, but I had no way, I couldn't go out because these Tsaka's were milling around the building and I had not seen the police, so I said to Nebe, man, I think you should release me, I will come back tomorrow, but I decided that I would leave.\n But they knew I could run.",
