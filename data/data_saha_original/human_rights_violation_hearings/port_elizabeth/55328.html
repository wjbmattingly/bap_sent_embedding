<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Your partner disappeared on the 3rd of July 1987, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> He left your house - did he say where he was going to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> He said he was going to Walmer Gardens, Walmer Gardens.</p>

<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>Gardens?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Well, they normally played pool and they have a drink amongst friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> And on the 4th of July 1987 you were called by the police and they told you that his body had been found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> That's correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Where did they find his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> In Soweto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> That is Soweto in Port Elizabeth, not Soweto in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> No, in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> You then drove to Louis Le Grange police station and you were asked to identify the body of your partner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> That's correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> How was the body when you found it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> The body was so burnt up and it was so bad, I don't think anybody could identify it, so I just prayed and then I went into the mortuary and I said I just wanted to see his feet and by looking at the feet, I identified him in that manner, that way. That's the only way I could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Mrs Stols do you have an idea why your husband was killed in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> I don't know, I have no idea, not at all.  No I can't understand that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Is there any request that you want to make to the Commission on this matter?</p>

<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BORAINE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mrs  Stols, I am not going to keep you long - I know that you are very nervous today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a> Was there any possibility that your husband, that the motive for the murder was theft?  I mean did he have a car, was the car found, how did he, have you any idea how did he get to where he was found, was anything stolen, a watch perhaps or money, any details at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> No, I don't think it was theft, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR BORAINE:</span> So his personal belongings were still on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Well, I mean ... (tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR BORAINE:</span> Charged, I know there is a difference between somebody being charged and somebody being found guilty.  Were they actually being charged with the murder of your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> I don't think so, but I know they caught about eight of them.  I know they were caught.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR BORAINE:</span> Just a last question.  Did you have a lawyer at the time who could represent you at the court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BORAINE:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>PORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>6 SR STOLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">REVD TUTU:</span> Dr Ramashala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS RAMASHALA:</span> Mrs Stols, do you have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS RAMASHALA:</span> How old were they when their father died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Only the one son, he was 16.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS RAMASHALA:</span> He was 16 then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> He was in standard 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS RAMASHALA:</span> What does he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS RAMASHALA:</span> What does he do now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> He is a manager.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS RAMASHALA:</span> Manager.  You say that the death of your husband affected you.  Could you describe a little more how did it affect you, particularly physically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Physically drained.  Physically drained and emotionally, very much so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">REVD TUTU:</span> Actually you have done very well for somebody who is nervous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">REVD TUTU:</span> Thank you very much for coming.  We want to express to you our very deepest sympathies for what happened to your family when your husband was killed in this vicious manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a> And we hope as we said to the other people who testified, speaking about their own pain, that God will strengthen you and God will embrace you with His love and compassion and that the loneliness that you must surely experience, will be (indistinct), that you will know that God is Emmanuel, God with us, present in pain, in anguish, in death, in awfulness that God does not leave you, does not leave us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>PORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>7</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a> But we as a Commission will seek to come to the bottom of all of this and point out that the awfulness of our past includes  atrocities of this kind which don't know colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a> And we just hope that in a way to that the pain that you have will enable you to have a solidarity with other women, other mothers, other wives who have gone through similar experiences and that that solidarity will strengthen you, will uphold you as you share in the tears and yet say we have come through that hell and now we are in this kind of country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a> And pray that things of this kind will never happen again to anybody.  God bless you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MRS STOLS:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
