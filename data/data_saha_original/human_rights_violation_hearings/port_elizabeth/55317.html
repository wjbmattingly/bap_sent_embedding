<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>DR BORAINE: Chairperson the following witness is  Rejoice Mlungisi Kungwayo.  Could that person please come forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a> Good afternoon Mr Kungwayo, would you please put the earphones on so that we can follow each other.  I want to just test that you can hear my voice and can hear the translation. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> Yes, I can hear properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">DR BORAINE:</span> Fine.    Mr Kungwayo, just like the previous witness you've had a very long wait and I hope you are not too tired and that you are ready to tell your story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> Your story is similar in a way to the previous story we've heard.  It involves the whole question of the UDF-AZAPO but there is an element of even greater tragedy, the sense of awful killing by necklace and you weren't even there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> So it must be very hard for you.  We want you to tell us the story.  Before you do so though, I must ask you to stand to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">REJOICE MLUNGISI KUNGWAYO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">DR BORAINE:</span> Thank you very much.  Please be seated.  Mr Kungwayo, Calin Xundu is going to lead you and be of assistance to you as you tell your story, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Kungwayo, your story is almost similar to the previous one.  I'd like you just to highlight and mention the following aspects.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>PORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>2 RM KUNGWAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> To which organisation did you belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> I was a member of the UDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were you all members of the UDF or was it only you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> No, it was me who was a member.  No my elder brother was also not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Why were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> I can state that in 1985 I was arrested due to the feud which was among the UDF and AZAPO members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> It was during the time when the community members were assisting the UDF so as to protect their families, especially the leaders who were always terrorised by the AZAPO members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Why were you arrested, was their a charge laid against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> In the statement intimidation and the possession of dangerous weapons were the charges which were laid against me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> How long were you sentenced for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> I had to serve 18 months, it was in 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> When did you learn about your brother's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> It was in 1985, I was a prisoner at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did they tell you how your brother was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> No, they didn't give me details.  It was just a letter which I received from my family.  My wife used to write me letters so that is how I got this information.  There were other political prisoners who were detained and they also informed me about this.  They also stated that he had been burnt and he was necklaced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Do you think he was just isolated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> Could you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>PORT ELIZABETH HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>3 RM KUNGWAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was there a fight during this day or do you think he was singled out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> According to the information it was said he was burnt when he was found in one of the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were there any inquest held or was there any post-mortem according to the information?  Did you get any information about an inquest or a post-mortem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> No, nothing was done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Do you have a death certificate to the effect that your brother had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> Yes, I have it because when I came out of the prison I made attempts to obtain the death certificate, I have it with me now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What would you like the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> I left my brother in the house and during the time he was not an activist, I was the activist. So I left him with my wife, so what I would like to request is the Commission should please establish the reasons for my brother's murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was he married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> No, he was not married.  He just had a girlfriend with whom he co-habitated, they have a child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> In other words does he have a child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> Could you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Does he have a child or how old is the child and which standard is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> I think the child is doing Sub B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Where does she live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> She lives with the grandmother.  The grandmother is frail and aged.</p>

<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>4 RM KUNGWAYO</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> In other words you would like the Commission to assist you with the maintenance of the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> The problem is that I'm unemployed.  Nobody is employed, my wife is not employed either and usually my niece usually visits us because I've never contributed anything, his father is deceased, the child's mother is deceased and the person who is looking after the child, is aged. We would like to get some assistance and also that there should be some enquiries into his death, my brother's death.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">DR RAMASHALA:</span> Grandmother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> Yes, she is staying with the maternal grandmother.</p>

<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUNGWAYO:</span> No, I don't know.  She gets old age pension.</p>
