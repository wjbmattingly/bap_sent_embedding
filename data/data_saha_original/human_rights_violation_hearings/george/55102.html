<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>NOXOLO JAFTA Duly sworn states</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>Thank you very much, please sit down.  Dr Ramashala will be facilitating your testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>I'd like to say that this  case involves the shooting of Ms Noxolo Jafta at some point in 1988 by kitskonstabels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> Me Jafta good morning and welcome.  I would like you to go  back to that day in 1988 when you were shot by the kitskonstabel and relate your story in as detailed way as possible to assist us in - not only investigating, but also in documenting this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>MS JAFTA</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Thank you in 1988 I was sent to a shop at home to buy some things and I  was with my friend.  When we got to the shop I bought these goods and from the shop on we are going up - near - at Freedom Square we were going up, there was a  [indistinct] that was going down and the other roads goes to the shop and the other road goes down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> As we are walking there, a friend of mine came, who's name was Simon, he asked for R0-05 from me, because he lost his  R0-05 and then I gave it to you.  Then further a constable came, they  were walking on the other street and we were in the other - I was still giving out this R0-05 and this man says hey child come here, I  said I  am  coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> And he said when I  am calling you, you must rush, you must come quickly, I said yes I am coming.  Whilst I am still taking out this money and then this man shot me whilst I was standing with Simon.  He - he shot us and Simon picked me up and we ran - jumped the fence and I couldn't jump the  fence, I fell inside the yard.  And   [indistinct] took me - took me to the police, I was still bleeding, I  can't remember what colour of clothes I was wearing, because when they shot me, I just saw many people, I didn't know what was going on, I didn't know where my parcels were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> A van came, then they took me to a van,  [indistinct] said they should take me to the hospital and they asked him to remain, he wasn't going to go with us.  But then he took a car, said we'd meet in the hospital.  Two blokes - kitskonstabels were in the van, one was David his surname was Sibango the other one was - they were quite elderly, that is Zizani  the one who shot me, they took me to the hospital.   They said they were taking me to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> But when we left   [indistinct] we went up the road towards the graveyard, on the road to  graveyard.  The police were driving the can, they swerved the  van along on the road and David as asking me to tell the truth about what we were doing at  [indistinct] from  Freedom Square, because say  people were singing and playing dice.  I said I couldn't dice because I am a girl, asked me how old I  was, I told him I  was 15 - I was 15 -  1988, I told him that I was 15, he took me as - from the graveyard, whilst we were at the  graveyard, he said I  should tell the truth and he clapped me with an open hand.  I cried,  said I've done nothing, said yes I have done something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> When they asked me, he said I must agree that I was gambling, so I  was taken to hospital and I was admitted there, I  was taken into another room and that was the last I remember.  The following morning I  noticed that I was being guarded and they said I couldn't leave, I  would pass water there, they wouldn't let me go out, because they alleged that I was gambling and they asked me where Simon was, I  said I didn't know where he was, because he jumped the fence.  I said I didn't know where he was, then they tell me as your mother was coming to the hospital, she couldn't see me, they closed the curtains, if my mother brought me some food, they would take that food, they took it  back if I  asked to go out, they wouldn't let me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> I stayed two weeks - the third I - my father came to  fetch me and - at  [indistinct] and I  was still in hospital  [indistinct]   He didn't  take me to hospital  [indistinct]  - he didn't take me to home, he took me to the charge office and interrogated me about what we were doing at Bhongolethu.  I said there was nothing I was doing, there was nothing we were doing and he said I had agreed to the policeman that - that I was gambling because they said -  because they were hitting me.  So I agreed because they were hitting me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> So this  father said I'll take you home, but if you have agreed then you are guilty and I said no I didn't do anything and then he took me to another room where there was a detective - white detective, they shouted at me and I  told him that when he was shouting, he was terrorising me.  He said I should tell the truth, I said there was nothing we were doing at Bhongolethu and then another Coloured detective and he said - he talked to me gently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> I told him that there was nothing we were doing at Bhongolethu because I was sent to the shop and I met this man and this man shot me and he asked where is the  other child with whom I  was  [indistinct]   I said I don't know because he was trying to pick me up, I don't know how far he went, that's all.</p>
