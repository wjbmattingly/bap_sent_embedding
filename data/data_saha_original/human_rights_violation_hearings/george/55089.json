            "Well it was the 13th of September 1976 that was the year when the youth rebelled and that was also the case in George.  In Borcherds, that's where I live, in that particular year, the youth were in revolt and there was a lot of stone throwing, they - they stoned the  vehicles in Sandkraal Road.  And next to Sandkraal Road, there was a wooded area and the youth moved out of the bush there to stone the vehicles.\n And then when the police arrived, they would run back into the bush into Acacia Street to get away from  the police.  And many of us ran into Lawaaikamp, that is the same Gracia Road which divides Borcherds and Lawaaikamp.  \n At about five o'clock, somewhere between five and six o'clock, people started arriving home from work and there is a road on the other side of  this bushy area where the bus usually stopped to - for the workers to get of.  Now there was al little foot path through this bushed area to the shop  and it  also went on to Lawaaikamp's area.  Now from this Gracia Road, there was also a foot path leading to  the shop and then on to Lawaaikamp.\n The police was shooting at people at that stage and they also shot at the innocent workers who had just come from work.  And they shot at us, whom they thought was stoning the police vehicles and the police.  It was between five o'clock and six o'clock when Abida was on her way to the shop, she wanted to  go and buy some sweets.  She was totally unaware of all the dangers lying in wait for  her.  And it was at that stage that the police started shooting again -  shooting at innocent people.  Abida was one of those shot by the police.\n The people who were arriving home from work, were also  shot, some of them - they were totally innocent, they had just arrived home from work.  Now Abida was shot, she fell - the police picked her up - they picked her up by the arm and the one leg and threw her into the police van.  This happened between five and six o'clock in the afternoon.  And they took me away as well.\n I can't tell you whether they went straight to the hospital with Abida or whether they still drove up and down, because at that stage anything was possible.  The police could do anything.  When my parents went to  the police, they were told that Abida had already died, that she was dead on arrival at the hospital.   She wa 12 years old at the time - 1976.  She was in std 5 at Heidedal school, that is all from my side.",
