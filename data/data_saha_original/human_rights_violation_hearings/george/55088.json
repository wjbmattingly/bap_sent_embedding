Soyisile wasn't with me, however, what he did he came to me for the first time to tell me that he met - met kitskonstabels this kitskonstabels -  the previous before the day before they shoot him, they asked for tobacco from him and he didn't give it to them, and they quarrelled over that.\nAfter that quarrel they disbursed each one his one way, I am in my own place and Soyisile stays with his  mother in the old location.  I heard when I  was on my way to church the other day, some kids who shouted at me and said, there Soyisile is lying there, he has been shot by David Sibango - David Sibango.  I was driving my car and when I  turned on my way to them - to see - to have a look at this - then there was this other kitskonstabels together with other - two other white and then I - a gun was pointed at me by one of the kitskonstabels and he said - here is this  dog, and I am also  to  [indistinct] and then he used very obscene words.\nAnd this  kitskonstabels name was said  to be Skhumbuzo.  He called me names by my mother.  The white one stopped him and said don't - don't shoot him, then they said I  could go - I said no, I can't go, I just want to  find out what the problem was.  At that time Soyisile was down on the ground and the  sun is - face is hanging on his  face and then they  turned him around and he - as he was lying on his side and then they turned him around and his  face was up, facing the sun and he was lying on his back so that the blood should not move, because they shot him on the side, at the left.\n [indistinct] and I then ran to my car because this one wanted to shoot me, this one called Skhumbuzo and David was just standing over the corpse and then I  went on - as I was going towards Bhongolethu, there was some people from Bhongolethu  who were coming back and they could see the  [indistinct]  [indistinct] and the  [indistinct] there, the son of - and two Coloureds who were also shot, they were also in that tragedy, which took place on that day when Soyisile was shot.\nWhen I wanted to go and find out from the police what the reason was for the shooting of my younger brother, I was told that I should go to town.  There at Bhongolethu there was a police station at the time, they told me to go to town.  I didn't go to town, I went to the hospital and that's where I  saw the three corpses.\nI just want to say to the Truth Commission maybe my statement may be different from the one that I gave for the first time, because I  don't remember all this things in my  mind, because I  just  [indistinct] of them and it's a long time, since this happened, regarding the death of Soyisile.\nI just want to say that's all I can remember about my  younger brother.   Amongst the papers that we have here it is said that on the 10th of February 1988  there was someone who killed - who killed a kitskonstabel his name was Bangi Salman it is alleged that a few days thereafter the kitskonstabels in their  anger, angry because one off  them - one of their colleagues that they  decided to take it on the people and Soyisile was one of them.\nDo you - do you understand it that way?",
