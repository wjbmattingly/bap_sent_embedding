At that moment the mother asked where the I D was and we called our brother and again my mother asked what was happening, and he said he doesn't know.  The boers were outside, they took  my brother.  They went up Mount Road.  At a distance my brother felt that there is something that happened about Lungile.\n When they went to Mount Road, they found a lot of \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 P TABALAZA\ncorpses who had just been left on the ground and the cement.  Lungile was amongst them and blood issued through his nose and ears.  They asked my brother to identify, but he was unable to answer.  It took him 18 seconds.  He became mute and they took him outside and back home.  He was shocked and said, \"My mother, we must not mourn for Lungile because he was deliberately murdered\", and he went out.\n There is an article in the newspaper that reflects on this.  Mr Pretorius is reflected also.  It seems as if he saw something.",
