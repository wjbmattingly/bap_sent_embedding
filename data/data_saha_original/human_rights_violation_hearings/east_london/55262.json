            "What happened is that the ANC and other political organisation had been banned.  I joined the ANC underground in Lesotho.  I went, because I have got family in Maseru.  I was working for the ANC.  I would come in and out of the country.  My task was to form cells and stay in Zwelitsha.  In 1980 when I joined the ANC I formed cells in Zwelitsha.  I got certain Comrades.  After that some Comrades wanted to leave the country.  I left with them.  I had a seven month old baby that I was breast feeding, a boy.\n In November I left with the Comrades, Thabo Bashe, Mncekeleli Peter, Phumezo Mene.  I have forgotten the other Comrade's name, because he passed away.  On the way, we were travelling by train, in Burgersdorp we were waiting for a bus.  We realised that we were missing, Phumezo Mene was the only one there.  I do not know what happened, but apparently they had gone to the township.  It was only the two of us that got onto the bus eventually.  There were two brothers.  I left with the one.  The other had gone to the township.  I do not know what he had gone to do at the township.  Phumezo and I got onto the bus.  We were on our way to Aliwal North.  \n On the way a car stopped the bus.  Khumbula Thabo and other gentlemen came.  They identified themselves as policemen.  I was with my sister as well.  They asked if I was with Cora.  They left with Cora.  Khumbula Mene, there is also a brother.  Phumezo Mene and then there is Khumbula Mene.  Khumbula is the one I was with in the bus.  After that Thabo gave a signal that these were the police, therefore I did not divulge anything.  When we got to Aliwal North towards Stickspruit a Boer and a Black man got onto the bus.  They said that they are looking for a woman with two children.  It was only myself that was left.  I was taken to the Aliwal North Security Branch office.  \n They asked where I was going.  I said I am going to Stickspruit.  They asked who I was with.  I told them that I was with my sister and my child.  They said I was lying.  They called other police.  There is a Boer, Bezuidenhout, he got onto the table and pulled my hair.  He said I must tell the truth, where, I said I was going home.  They took something from a sack.  He left with the sack as well.  They came back with it.  It was wet.  They put it on my face.  I think they referred to it as a canvass bag.  They suffocated me.  They, my child was crawling at the time.  They just gave him a toilet bag to play with.  I told them that I was going home.  They were slapping me until I fell on the floor.  Bezuidenhout sat on my stomach, took my babies little blanket and stifled me on my face.  \n After that they said they said they were going to detain me.  They are going to take my sister and my child and take them home.  I asked them to leave the child with me, because my baby was being breast fed at the time.  They took me to Jamestown Police Station.  I spent the night there.  I saw four cars.  Thabo was in one of the cars.  We came back to King William's Town.",

He said a man had been beaten up and urinated on the floor.  They said that if I do not tell the truth I was going to be beaten just as much.  I insisted that I was going home.  They came towards me with a sack.  They threw me on the floor somehow.  They pulled my legs.  They put electric shocks on my breasts, on my stomach and at the bottom.  Also, around my jaws, because I would bite my, the inside of my mouth, my oral cavity when they would, I was on shock.\n They said I must tell the truth.  They said I must go to Hattingh.  Hattingh said that I was going to tell the truth.  I could not control my bladder because of the electric shocks.  I had just given birth as well.  Therefore I think there was something around my uterus.  Hattingh said I must sit down.  I told them eventually that I was from Lesotho, I was recruiting ANC members and forming cells.  He asked who was recruiting, who had recruited myself.  I said it was Sima.  They asked for forgiveness for having tortured me.  They asked if I could work for them.  They are going to release me.  They are only going to detain the rest.  They said now and again I would bring them information.  They also said that they wanted me to help them with a certain gentleman they wanted in Lesotho.  I said that I would not be able to do that.  They must just detain me.  They said that they would pay for my university fees, give me a car and give me R1 000,00 every month if I worked for them as an informer.  After that, the following day they put us together.

They said that I must give them my life history.  I must write it down for them.  I did that.  One afternoon at about half past four, it was very warm, I was with my child.  My baby just had a vest on.  They said I must just come quickly.  My child cried, because they insisted that I leave him behind.  My child was crying.  They said that I was talking shit.

Therefore my sister came when I was ill in King William's Town Prison.  After six months of trial I could not urinate.  I think it is because of the electric shocks.  I went to a doctor, I was giving medication.  I lost a lot of weight, because the side effects of the medication was loss of appetite.  I told my sister that I was not well.  When I handed my child over in King William's Town the police came and said I must go back into the cell and eat at the cell at 11 o' clock.  They said that they were in a hurry, I must go with my food and my baby into the cell.\n When I was in there I washed my plate, but as I was washing the plate the water ran out.  As I was trying to flush the toilet as well I could see that there was no water.  I realised that there was some gas.  I could smell gas coming out of the taps.  I realised that I was getting dizzy.  My child was sleeping.  Whilst I was dizzy the police came.  Usually when they come to the cell they make a whole lot of noise and my child would get up.  That particular time my child did not get up.  They came and said they had come to fix the loo.  I said that my child was not waking up.  They said what was wrong.  I told them there was gas coming out.  I took the child and put the baby outside the cell.\n A nurse came.  This nurse that she did not know what was going on.  My throat was very dry because of the gas and I was still dizzy.  I went to try drink water from the loo, but I could and I could see from the mirror that I was absolutely pale and my throat was very dry.  I was supposed to get a visitor.  I saw Vuyisa, my sister, coming to visit me.  They said that they are going to close early.  I said I was not going to, back to the cell with my child, because they were going to kill me and what I was saying was not coherent.  Therefore it was imperative that my sister leave with my child.  I could see they wanted to kill me.  I refused to go back to the cell.  I started screaming so that if, so that if they kill me I would have made some noise so that the other prisoners could hear.\n I had read about a certain Dr Aggart.  Apparently before he died he had been unconscious standing outside.  I thought perhaps they would also want to kill me the way they had killed Dr Aggart.  I said that I would not go back to the cell.  I made a whole lot of noise.  They then said I must take my child to my sister.  It was all foggy.  Vuyisa then took my child.  I went back to the cell.

Van Heerden asked why I was making such a noise.  Van Heerden said I must stop making a noise.  If I continue they were going to hang me to.  She asked if I know what strangling is all about.  She showed me.  I then stopped screaming.  The next day Mr Maqabie came to visit me.  I could not speak properly.  I told him that they had tried to gas me to death again.  I told him I was scared.  They must please find out, they must tell me why they were gassing me.  They must tell me the truth, what was the gas they used.",

Dr Aggart, they said that Dr Aggart had also killed himself, hung himself with sheets.  I was in detention when he died.  They thought that I did not know how he died.  They would take the clothing and say that it is proof that we had committed suicide.  I told them specifically that they must try other means.

I am terribly sorry about what you have gone through, especially the pain of having been parted with your child.  As Dr Magwaza had said, there is nothing that you did not go through, especially because you are a woman.  A lot of things that happened to you happened because you are a woman.  They would not happen, would have happened were you a man.  You were very young when you joined the struggle. We hope that all that has happened to you has not discouraged you.  I hope you are strong and you are still positive about life.  Thank you.  You may step down.",
