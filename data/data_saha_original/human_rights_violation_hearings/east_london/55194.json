            "I am Mrs Hashe.  I have nine children. My biological children are five, four others are my sister's children.  I take them as my own children also. My husband was a very considerate person and was and had a good heart because he wanted to support all those who were suffering.  That's how we got to adopt these children.  I'm a woman who loves children and that is why it was easy for my husband to adopt those children.\n When I come to giving an account of what happened, I would like to give an account without making any mistakes. I married Hashe, I want to reveal everything that I have and give the honest account of what happened.  My husband was a staunch struggle person, but the way he worked committedly during the struggle was more conspicuous in 1963 when he was arrested.  He was arrested in our first house where we were staying in 1980..... (end of first side of tape )\n(second side of tape)....my husband woke up and went to open the door.  When he asked who they were they said they were police.  And when they came in they just said, \"Put on your clothes, we have arrived\". \n In our identity documents, called Domboek, at the time, EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 HASHE\nhe was written as Charles and the police discovered that he was really Hashe.  There was a security officer who is George and he has a very big head, that's how we could identify him. At the back there were some people in the shadow and this person came forward and asked, \"Is it Hashe?\", and then when we affirmed that it was him, they said he must just put on his clothes and then he must go. And then they were not certain because in the I D document his name was reflected as Charles and they were looking for Hashe, but when he confirmed they took him. And during this period when they came to arrest him, they were kicking everything in the house and there was something which had a sentimental value, my sewing machine which I got which my husband bought for me when I attended a school.  They broke this machine to which I was so sentimentally attached and they took my husband away.\n We went around looking for my husband.  As you all know, this is what happens when somebody disappears. We were vendors and we were selling vegetables.  And that is the way in which we were sending our family.  When my husband left us I was unable to continue as a vendor and I went to visit him at Royal, the jail, and when I came back I received a letter, and this letter was from an office. I was being called by the headman.  When I arrived there, they told me that I am selling vegetables but that I am unlicensed and I confirmed that I didn't.  They also told me that I should remove everything which I sold, and I agreed and then I went away.\n I continued and I disregarded the questions.  They came along again, took my vegetables, threw them outside, and I felt hurt about this.  I was dependant on these little \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 HASHE\nearnings that I received and when my husband was taken away I became the sole bread winner and I was also sending my children to school, using the same money which I obtained from vending.\n They called me again and I was summoned to appear.  They threatened again that I must stop selling. But when I came back I continued selling.  I went to the attorney to Tiche, and told him about the harassment that I experienced from the headman and I don't have a licence. The attorney took the case.  I request that the Commission should excuse me  for my uncertainty because the Black Sash was also coming and there was a bit of a relief.  Tichi took the case and I got a chance and an opportunity to get some relief from being hounded by the police and I continued without any disturbance.  \n But one day when I came back from the market, I found that all my belongings and my property were taken outside as well as my children.  I rushed to my home and when I got there, and asked what was happening, I was informed that the headman had come and evicted us from the house.  I went immediately to the office to establish what the problem was and asked where I should go to.  I also asked them what the reason was for their harassment and they expressed their views that I am suffering because of my husband who they branded as a terrorist. They also told me that the house  is owned by my husband and because I do not own the house, I am evicted therefrom. I cried bitterly and I thought of what I should do. \n I went to our headman, Milisiswe is my relative, and expressed my feelings about what has happened. He said to me, I'm not sure you will understand exactly what I want to \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 HASHE\nsay, but they said in the beginning they evicted me because I owed rent on the house and also electricity.  When I went to pay the rent they refused to take it.  I accumulated this money and continued going to them to pay for every account that I owed but they kept on refusing to accommodate me.\n This continued for several times, I asked my brother what I should do because the same thing is happening again, and he told me to come to him so that he can take me to Mr Lamani, and my brother explained what has happened to me, to Mr Lamani.  He was asked to go with the money and they discussed the matter at length and in the end they took the money.  But at the same time they said they have taken the house and repossessed it again.  Mr Lamani ordered them to take me back to my house, a four-roomed house.  When I arrived back at my house, they told me again that they repossessed the four rooms and have given me a two-roomed house.\n I questioned their way of doing things because I was wondering how I'm going to continue staying with such a big family in a two-roomed house?  But we agreed that I should consider the fact that, rather than having nothing, I must be at the two-roomed house.  They also told me I cannot get my four-roomed house back because they have already sold it.\n I went on selling again.  At some stage.",

            "In Robin Island in detention he stayed three years and it was said I should go and see him.. They would never say he's not available.  They said a person who came to my place to detain him crossed.  He came back, I mean, he was sentenced to seven years and this carried on for ten years.  He was not available at home as a husband and me as a woman.  That time, while he was still in Robin Island, was the time when I was suffering, police and everything, but the most important thing that happened when my husband came back from Robbin Island, I was now working at Holiday Inn, I was given an opportunity by a woman because our shelters that we used to sell our vegetables, were destroyed and after that, my children were now old enough and would help me carry the goods and then they would sell house to house.  These children were also arrested.  I was also arrested where I was selling outside.  I now thought, oh no, the money that I had is now finished, I have to pay a fine.\n Now I got hold of this woman who helped me through to getting to Holiday Inn and she was ill.  She was working night shift and got sick and while I was doing a temporary job for her she passed away. I would go to work in the evening and come back during the day and carry on selling.  This thing continued, now when my husband came out, or just before he did so, he wrote a letter.  He said I should go and get his books that he was reading at the Passport Office.  Those were the things I forgot to mention to you.  I took those books and then on my way back with the books, I got into the house to pack the books nicely and prepared \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 HASHE\nthe children for bed. I went out just a few minutes, there was a car.  I was wondering what car it was.  And the asked me if I knew the man in the back of the van after ten years.  I said, \"Yes, he's my husband\".  I was now at my house No 21.  They started at the old house and then they proceeded to the new one.  He went out, two Xhosa security men went with him into the house.  The first thing he asked me, \"Do you still accept me, because I will never leave fighting for the freedom of the people?\"  I said, \"Yes, why not?\"  Then we laughed and went into the house. While we were busy sitting, these police gave him documents, a banning order.  He was not supposed to go anywhere.  He was not supposed to go even to the school that other side.  This went on.  I went back to work, because he saw that I was working, because we were busy talking and we had to have something to eat.  He said to me, \"I hope it is your last time to work today\".  I thought, \"Oh he's joking\".  I went to work.\n The following day I was at the bus stop and he was waiting for me there. Truly I never had any chance to go to work again because he didn't want me to work. My first born asked, \"What shall we eat?\" He showed me that we will be dragging some meals.  This went on, truly he would stay at home, someone would come, he only had permission to see two people, I was the third one. One of them came home and then when the people realised that he has come back from jail they came to visit him but he was allowed to see only two visitors at a time.\n We continued living under these terrible times with inadequate income because my husband refused that I should go to work again.  We kept on selling these vegetables together and then it developed much better than before when \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 HASHE\nhe was here as a supportive person.  We continued to support each other until he was able to buy a second hand van and we continued working and I would go and buy some vegetables and then we would go about selling them.",

There were no members.  Instead it was pulling and pushing, but they had to find a way in which they would progress with the running.  I think people know this. My husband stood up, he was told that he had to be coopted so that he will bring back the children.  He did just that.\n There was a boycott, I think it was a bus boycott. This bus boycott never continued, it was never successful, it was in 1983.  He was right in.  There were people who got arrested because some of them were not really liable.  The way the bus strike was continuing, it was really up and down, not knowing whether to get in or not.  Leaflets were distributed, and he was arrested.\n Time went on, he was coopted, I don't know but he was coopted.  He worked with these children as much as he was working with them, they tried to organise themselves and \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 HASHE\nthings went well between them, but in the middle something happened.  There was a misunderstanding between them and the councillors.  Fifteen families at Veeplaas, were sitting there, their books were stamped.  They were actually people who had been evicted from their houses., so they took themselves and squatted.  Now the police took these people, small children and infants, they were wrapped in plastic. They went to Rome and they were given a place at the Father's mission.  The people stayed there, the food was provided and they were three in number.  This food was brought to me so that I could cook for the children, these people would come and help me cook, using my garage.  As time went on they discovered they would have to eat at home,  and would leave after eating and they would eat and then leave.\n They decided to go to Labour to get their documents in order.  Things were right, these who were expelled from their duties were reincorporated and they got their place in Motherworld.  Now the thing that I'm trying to tell is that during those times when they were working, something just happened, children were shot by these councillors.  This is one important point, these councillors really shot the children.  The children were striking, they took this on themselves to try and show the people, to hear their feelings about this bad thing that has just happened.  They came to the conclusion of embarking on a stay-away.",

Actually this was discussed at a meeting and they went out to the\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 HASHE\nwholesalers.  They told the people the right way of going along with this strike.  The strike took three days, it was a Friday, a Saturday and then on Monday, those three working days.  This stay-away was very fully supported.

My husband, now people are now joining P, they want to come and join...

He was there to answer.  On his return he gave us a report that the people who were working in the house, he said the telephone call was from Mr Fassi, he said we are wanted at the offices now.  We have to attend to a very urgent meeting at the airport.  He said to us we have a meeting that I have to attend with the British Consulate.  \n This went on, people joined.  During the day they would break and Mr Kaqaule would to is place to have lunch and Galela would do the same.

Busy preparing the food, not even on the plates, Mr Fassi stepped in.  They were driving in a red car.  Our van is in the garage. Mr Fasi entering the house would say,\"My brother are you still here? When are you going to leave? You are late\",  and he would stand up, prepare himself, he would go into the room and say, \"Ntobile, please take care, I'll come and have my meal when I come back\".  And I would go to him as he has mentioned, and I would say to him, \"I will take everything that you have bought\", he bought this hat from Mr Duze because he had a shaven head, so I said that is how he was easily recognised. He said, \"I'm coming back\",  and then I told him to put the hat on so that he can hide his shaven head. He told me where the money was, he told me that it was the organisation's money and also he told me where our money was and they were at separate places, our money and that of the organisation, because they were also selling liquor as off-sales.\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n13 HASHE\n He went away with Mr Fassi and Mr Ngoyi.

Mr Fassi told him on their way that he, Mr Fassi and Ngoyi will not be going along because they are going to a meeting in Uitenhage.  He also told him that he should get some people who can give support and accompany him to the airport.  On their way to the airport, I'm a bit confused, but please bear with me, on their way to the airport, when they went out from the house, there was a police van which also reversed from our area.  They went past on the next street and my husband, whom I valued very much, went away together with Mr Galela, late.\n I didn't go to Mr Galeka's place to find out what is happening but now it was a long time since they left and I became so anxious because what kept them so long.  I was outside with one of my neighbours and one of the men who was also a member of this organisation, we saw a white car coming along next to our place, there were two whites in front and at the back we suspected that black people were sitting there.  And when we looked and scrutinised the car we could see that these people were carrying guns which were protruding through the windows at the back.  \n They asked whether we were fighting.  But when I was about to answer, this young man put a hand on my mouth because he knew that I was going to swear at these people, and then he answered himself and said that we were not fighting.\n The car went away to the next street and just it's front was visible. I was getting very restless now and I was EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n14 HASHE\nvery anxious because I was looking at this car with the revolvers protruding out the windows, and I was anxious that my husband was not there to support me.  The girl next door was also anxious because she came along and informed me that this car was nearby and also that guns were protruding from the back windows.  At some stage the car just moved on and didn't go by the way in which they arrived.  It went along the Stefel Road next to the stadium and I was panicking all the time and wondering what was happening about my husband.  But I kept on hoping.  \n Later Mr Fassi came along again very early in the morning and he was also surprised that my husband was not back yet, and I also hopelessly informed him that he really didn't come back.  We are recognised relatives, Mr Fassi and I because we share the same clan name.  And then he advised me to take this issue to the attorneys and he also said that he recognised that the car, our van was not back yet, and that's what made him realise that my husband is not back yet.  As he went away, I was unhappy and I was also certain that he was arrested.\n I kept on wondering and I was also restless and late, but not very late, one lady came and said, \"There are people who are reported to have got lost\", and my husband was one of them.  I was also surprised and asked what is meant by saying my husband is lost? Sookie who informed me about this, said we must go along, because he came by car.  We went along trying to go to each and every charge office and we were afraid to get in, so that we knew that the minute we got in, they would do something to me because they already know me and that I was also in the struggle.  We were just putting the car outside and just peeped through, and \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n15 HASHE\nat the end we went to Port Elizabeth at Walmer.  \n We came back in vain.  There were young men who always held vigil as my husband was away. And they also learned about this tragedy that my husband has not come back, and were also panicking and asking themselves as to what happened. On the 8th, late at night, and on the 9th, the people came and so many of the children who were also recruited for this organisation came and we were also worried about the fact that we were unsure about the AZAPO Organisation, because each time when there was something which was done, it was said it was said that it was AZAPO which had caused anything which was bad in the community, but they would never be arrested. And then we started to doubt their relationship with the police and the security.\n And then we decided, that as they were all come along, because AZAPO and PASO were together at my place, and we felt that we should reduce the numbers so that not so many people at my place.  Late at night a person threw a stone into the house whilst I was feeding the children.  When I opened the door, I saw many torches and these were directed at my door.  I closed my door again and warned the children and said to the young men who were here, \"These are the Boers who have come here, it is not AZAPO\", and when I was saying this I was also worried that the children would be shot at.  I rushed out and I was shouting at everybody to be on guard and to be secure but at the same time there were a lot of people who were throwing stones at my house.\n When the house was burned some time back I had sewn some cloths and put some stones and gravel inside, and I would sew these little bags and put some stilts on the stones, knowing that we were going to fight against each \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n16 HASHE\nother,  the AZAPO and this PAKO.  At the same time I was giving instructions to all who were around of how to attack and also to defend ourselves.  And we were sure that we were going to use this heap of bags and bags of stones.  There was a child who was shot in the process, in the arm. Tear gas was thrown at our place and we were overpowered and we took the children away from the place and put them with my next door neighbour.  When I was trying to come around I saw a lot of people and at the same time I saw some fire and I did not know what was burning.  When I woke up the next door neighbour took me and said I must wait a bit, and we were talking in whispers and this gentleman told me to wait and see exactly what was happening so that I can give evidence.  At the same time I was unable to sit down.  I was so restless and I jumped out, I couldn't tolerate what was happening.  I could see that everyone was in my yard. The children were being assaulted, it was havoc and my children were also amongst those who were being attacked.\n There was also an explanation that the children were being arrested, we could hear the vans being closed and the Boers stayed in my house and they and they used Caspars and they cordoned the place and we couldn't move in.  So my place was their place and they were fully occupying my place and I couldn't do anything about it.  So I was next door watching them as they were enjoying themselves, they were celebrating their victory because they were having a braai and everybody was dancing amongst them.  We were helpless and couldn't do anything about this situation.  In the process one lady came in, and while we were there the police came next suspecting that I was accommodated in this house. So they broke the window but they didn't come in.\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n17 HASHE\n When we went there it was instructed that we should not touch or take anything in the house.

I started crying, was so emotional, because I knew what was going to happen.\n So I requested somebody to take him to another part of the location which is Zakele and when I went to work the following day, I went to my cousin, informed her about what is going to happen and also told him about the people who threatened to assault him, and also the story and gave an account about the arson which has taken place.\n Our cousin offered us a house and then she promised that she would go and stay with her family.  This was a one-roomed house but we endured the situation. I was working at the time and my husband was still unemployed.  The police discovered that I was still employed, the building in which I was employed was just in front of the court.  \n After the house belonging to Mrs Hashe was burned, the police, Mr Ndiyani and Mr du Preez, came in at work and asked for Mrs Godolozi.

They wanted the manageress and made enquiries about this Mrs Godolozi, and I was called in by the manageress, and when I went there, she showed them  who I was.\n They were very angry at me because I had made a fool of them, but I just kept quiet.  They took me away and when I went to SANLAM, they made enquiries again and they interrogated me.  They asked me whether I had a child and I said that I did and I told them his name. They were very angry because  my child's name was Umkonto Wesizwe and wanted to know why I gave him this name.  I just told them \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n29 GODOLIZI\nthat that is none of their business.  We exchanged words and they were questioning me about my background, asking me where we were staying, and I gave them an incorrect address.\n One day they saw him on paper next to Mrs Hashe's place.  They asked us if we stayed there and we told them that we were not.  I was kept for hours at SANLAM and they were exchanging others who came in speaking in Afrikaans, I just kept quiet because I didn't always understand what they were saying.  \n When I came I informed my husband of what had happened at work.  We stayed for a few days.  My husband came back and informed me about some books which he had brought along.  He would bring some books at times from Lesotho and at times he'd take them away again and would no tell me what happened, and then he would also tell me that some of the books were banned.  He told me that these books were taken to his friend.

I was also suspicious of that because he didn't come back the previous night and I also was aware about what was always happening because the police were looking for the books.\n On this day, a Wednesday, up to Friday, we didn't receive anything.  On Monday I received a telephone call and my cousin told me that my husband was at court. Because the place where I worked was just opposite the court, I p[ut down the telephone and because we were able to move around unnoticed, I was able to go out and attend the court, but when I arrived back, the policemen were chasing everyone away. I was so surprised why they were doing this so that people could not attend the court but because I had disappeared from work I came back again.  At one o'clock during the lunch hour I went to court again, I went from door to door calling for my husband because at times there were people who were at the cells.\n    At that moment I could hear people talking about this \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n32 GODOLIZI\nincident and the people in Port Elizabeth were talking and I overheard them talking, because they didn't know that I was the wife to Godolozi, and the Port Elizabeth people were all affected by what the police were doing. I learned that my husband was taken to Alexandria.  Two days later my sister came, it was a long time that she was coming, so she came to look for my husband trying to find out what happened, and it was also publicised that my husband had disappeared together with his friend.  I just told my sister that my husband was taken away and we knew that they didn't just get lost but were taken away by them.\n So my sister stayed with me, giving me the support that I wanted at the time.  I cannot remember the exact date but it was already in February 1986.  At that time I went to work again because I was still employed.  I told the employers that my husband has disappeared ever since he was arrested and that nobody knows any trace about him. You know that we were aware that the Boers at the time were so sensitive and they were arresting everybody.  My sister organised a car for us so that we can go and look for my husband.

You know at the time everybody was alert and aware of this disappearance of my \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n33 GODOLIZI\nhusband and his friend, and we were informed that the Boers at the time were so sensitive, especially the police.  There were two policemen from Grahamstown. I did not even know them but this person was mentioning these people.  We went there, there was a policeman outside the house.  When we saw this person, it was David Mtala who was a policeman. He welcomed us and asked us what we wanted at Alexandria.  \nWe told him about our problem and he accommodated us.\n There was another policeman inside, he was a bit more mature that the other one, he looked also familiar, I knew his father who was a pastor, he was Mr Moyia.
