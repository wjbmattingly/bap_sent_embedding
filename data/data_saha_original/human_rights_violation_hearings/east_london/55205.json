We would like you to tell in your own words what it has been like, your hopes an your despairs, your moments of encouragement if there had been any and your moments of disappointment. your high notes and your lowest ebbs, all the emotions that have gone through your body in this decade or so, during which you have had to come to terms with the reality that you will never see your husband again.  And therefore I would like you to be relaxed, to know that this is your moment to tell us in your own words how your life has been in these last harrowing, almost ten years. Do you understand that?  I know that you want to testify in Xhosa and I would merely like you to raise your voice so that all who are here can hear the original version.  Do you understand that?

We went to the mortuary, we didn't get him, we went again to the police station to give our statement and an account of what has happened.

His address at the University was M S Jansen Hall.                                      He disappeared without trace in May last year, and wife who lives at 258 Nsobongo Street Butterworth, Transkei confirmed that he is still missing.  It appears that the last time his wife heard from was his ...(indistinct) was when he telephoned from in May from a shop to say that he was on his way back to the University.  She had evidently made enquiries at hospitals, mortuaries and police stations but so far without results.              It occurs to us that at the time of his disappearance Mr Mfeti may have been visiting a\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n20 MFETI\ntownship falling under the jurisdiction of Kwazulu.
