            "On the 28th of January 1993 I was with my sister at home, because my \nhusband was working at night on that day.  A day before I spent a night alone.  This \nday I asked my sister to come and stay with me, because I was scared at night alone.  \nThree young men came on this particular day.  One of them stood on the left side and \nthe other one on the right side and the other one in the middle.  It was in Summer in \nJanuary.  It was about eight o' clock at night.  We were listening to a story in the radio. \n When these people entered our yard I went to them asking them whether I can help, I \nhelp them.  The other one on the left side said that we are looking for your husband.  I \nsaid do you know him, because I did not know these people.  They said that we are \nlooking for your husband.  I said do you know the person you want?  This man said \nthat he is my friend, I am from NU5.  I said he was not there.  He asked me where he \nwas.  I said he was just around the area.  \n I was very scared of these people.  It was clear that they were up to \nsomething.  I thought that they wanted money or something or they wanted to rape us. \n I was scared of them, because of the way they dressed.  The two of them had, were \nwearing balaclavas.  The other one was wearing a navy jacket.  Their hairs were \ndreadlocked.  I said my husband was around the area and it is strange that you say that \nyou are his friend, because I knew all my husband's friends.  I wanted to close the door \nand this man took out a gun and he pointed me with the gun.  He then shot me in the \nshoulder and I felt pain in my arm.  We ran to the bedroom and my sister also followed \nme.  \n They entered the house whilst we were still trying to close the bedroom door.  \nWe were crying, calling out for our neighbours.  We were asking for forgiveness from \nthem, but they were just shooting the door and he shot me again in the arm as we were \ntrying to close the door.  My sister was also shot.  Three bullets in the liver, the other \none in the thigh.  I lost strength, because I was shot.  I thought that I was going to die. \n They then went through the bedroom saying that we had ADM weapons in the house. \n The other one got into my bed.  There was a suitcase on top of the wardrobe.  I had a \ncomforter in that suitcase.  They were looking for these weapons, but they did not find \nthem in the suitcase.\n At that house, my house was empty, because my daughter-in-law just moved \nout.  They did not see these weapons.  I gave them the keys so that they can search the \nhouse.  They said to me you are going to tell us where your husband is.  They dragged \nme and I lost consciousness at that time and I regained consciousness outside.",

I saw \nsomeone there, someone I worked with at the company chemical, member of the \nunion.  When I saw him I was hopeful, thinking that he would help.  However, he had \nforgotten my face.  He could not recognise me.  He is the one who got on the bed and \nlooked on top of the cupboard and said here these weapons are, these ADM weapons. \n He then pulled Lindelwa out.  I know that man, I am not doubting, I could point him \nout.  There is nothing more I would like to say.",

            "There is something I would like to add.  After we had come back from \nthe hospital the police said they could not take a statement, because I was in pain.  \nThey then came to my house, took a statement.  A few days later the Mayor, Lulamile \nNazo, came.  He was not yet a Mayor then.  He was together with Bonakele.  He said \nthat this case should not be taken to the police as yet.  They are first going to \ninvestigate why this man shot us.  They then said they would come back and tell us, \ngiving us feedback.  We waited for their response, for their feedback they had \npromised.  My father tried to phone Bonakele wanting to know what was going on.  \n We were still in pain.  There was nothing we could do about it.  Bonakele said \nwe should go to the police.  He did not give the reasons as they had promised.  We \nwere not connected to ADM at all.  Both my husband and I were not members of \nADM.  We were not members of any organisation.  The police handling the case, \nMqombothi, when my father went to him he said that these are cadres that he was \ndealing with.  We lost hope.  If a policeman was, if a policeman was tentative in \nhelping us then and fearful, there is nothing we could do for ourselves.  Our lives have \nchanged.  I am fearful.  If I am in my home I have to lock the doors all the time.  When \nI walk around I am scared, because I do not know what they wanted.  I do not know \nwhether they are still watching me.  In my heart I think that they still want to murder \nme.  That is all.",
