My mother was sleeping at home, she was sick.  I asked what happened.  She told me. She said that it was at night on Saturday, she was at home.  She heard people outside.  When she was going to see what was happening she met the police.  The police took her, forced her into a hippo and they took her to the bushes in Mission.  Two police were left with her.  The two policemen raped her and then they left her in that area.  She woke up and she went to a coloured township, to Bongweni to my uncle.\n When she got to my uncle, my uncle took her to the doctor.  On the following day he then took her to the police to report this matter.  The police asked whether she knew the people who did this to her.  She said no.  The police then said that there is nothing to be done if she did not know who these people were.  What happened when I got there is that I went to the Street Committee to ask for advice.  They then asked me to tell them the story.  After that Mr Goniwe, who was a Comrade, called ANC lawyers.  The lawyers got there and they took my mother with.  They then returned her back home saying that they will come again to pick her up.  \n The came and picked her up.  When she came back on this last occasion they said that they found the White men who did this to my mother.  After a month, I think two months, we received a letter saying that the White men who did this were found and they have been fined.  They have been fined R7 500,00 each.  I took this letter to these people, those who were handling this case.  They told me that the lawyers passed away so nothing will continue after that.  That is all my story.",
