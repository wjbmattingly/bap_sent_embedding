One of the speakers, Mr Moorcroft who was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, went to the police because at the time everybody knew what was happening, Mr Seboto invited people trying to make information and evidence to be available to give details about what happened during the funeral.  \n When we went around we were going past the school where my child was attending, as I was in front, as I was the \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 T MGINYWA\nchief mourner I saw a terrible sight.

The people were also unable to move and everybody was again trying to save his life.\n The teargas was then available.

The most important thing which I came here for is I knew that the teargas canisters were taken away and the people who took them they had a hope that I would not have evidence, but fortunately during the period when there was this commotion there was youth group who took photos of everything that took place there.  They even took photos of the canisters and that can be used I believe as the evidence, because even if they have destroyed the canisters the photos I believe they are still there.",

            "Firstly, usually when there is funeral we always assist and give a hand to one another, I was borrowed some of the items by my neighbours, there were chairs, there was cutlery, there were dishes, pots and everything that was being used during the funeral, what I am disturbed about is that the people, my neighbours who assisted me are not happy about the fact that things were lost there.  During this ten year period I am always anxious.  On this Saturday it was the tenth year after the funeral, each time I look at the\nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n10 T MGINYWA\npeople who assisted me I have the conscience that everything was destroyed and my neighbours were trying to give a hand and support me.  I would like to be compensated. \n Secondly, I would like the person who killed my child Big-Boy, should be brought forward.  I cannot state and I cannot explain the reason for them to kill him.  \n Another fact is, as a mother who is widowed, Big-Boy's father died whilst this child was only six years old.  I brought him up.  He was at the age where when I looked at him I would be reminded of my husband.  Each time I was looking at him I would always think of his father.  I had a hope that at a certain age he would also be able to support and assist me.  As Big-Boy was growing up, the house that I am talking about, as this commotion and this incident happened in 1986 there was nothing.  I tried to build a house but I couldn't finish building the house.  Because I am widowed I did not have anybody to help me except Big-Boy.  Everything which wanted a male partner to assist, Big-Boy used to take the role, so it was a great loss to lose him.  At times even the door, after he had died, I was unable even to fix the door when it was damaged but he was my handyman.  For everything which got damaged here he was very skilled and would assist us.  Even on the premises he would assist by keeping it orderly.  I was very proud of him and was ambitious and I was wishing that when he finished schooling I would be resting and be able to relax because I have taken the responsibility of taking them for education, all children.  I am earning meagre pay because I am not well educated but I had wished that all my children could get the best of education.\n During the time when I was widowed I had felt that I \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n11 T MGINYWA\nwas hopeless.  When I see other children whom I know that were the age group of Big-Boy I always get emotional because I always compare him to those children that I see.  Probably I would be relaxing and having somebody to assist me.  Today I don't have a shoulder to lean on.  I have to take the responsibility because the girl next door is my daughter.  She was also 20 months when the father died, so I had to take the responsibility and bring them up.  I would request that the Commission should assist me if I am trying to educate this child because I have inadequate means I would like their support.\n My hope has fallen and I don't have anybody to assist me.  Thank you.",
