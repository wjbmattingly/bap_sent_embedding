<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Mrs June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Can you put earphones on Mrs Gxidi, please.  Can you hear me </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>Mrs Gxidi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Would you mind if I called you Phumla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>MRS GXIDI:  I do not mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you very much.  Phumla, you are going to tell us about an </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>event that happened to you in July of 1985 when you were on your way back from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>funeral service for the Cradock Four.  You were travelling from Cradock back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>Queenstown and at that time, according to your testimony, you were four months, no, </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>I am sorry, five months pregnant.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MS CRICHTON:  If I may I would like to lead you in your questions so that, in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>questions I put to you so that we keep the order of your story, which is very </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>important, in order.  So I will ask you questions and interrupt you occasionally, if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>may.  The first thing I want to check with you is that the bus was stopped at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>roadblock.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MS CRICHTON:  That was at Whittle-Sea?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Who was it who took you off the bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MRS GXIDI:  The Ciskeian soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>MS CRICHTON:  And at about what time of the day was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MRS GXIDI:  We were coming, we left Cradock after five.  It was just before eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Now I would like you to explain in your own words to us exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>what happened when they took you off that bus, remembering that you were four </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>months, five months pregnant at the time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MRS GXIDI:  When we were about to arrive at Whittle-Sea a lot of soldiers came </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>around and they stopped the bus asking us where we were coming from.  We told </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>them that we were coming from Cradock.  They asked us which funeral, whose </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>funeral we attended.  We said that we were coming from Matthew Goniwe's and </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>others funeral.  They asked us why we left funerals in our area and attended funerals in </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>Cradock.  They said that we knew everything that was happening there.  They asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>us to sing songs which were sung in that funeral.  We sang church songs and we told </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>the that Mxenge was a speaker and they took us out of the bus and they took </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>pamphlets in our bus and t-shirts.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a> They told us to lie down on our stomachs.  They hit us.  Some of them had </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>hose pipes.  They spread water to us.  Two of us were pregnant and these soldiers </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>wanted to kick us so that we can lose our children.  Soldiers were kicking us.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>were riding on top of us.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Phumla, can I interrupt you to ask you just to make sure that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>have this on record.  Are you saying that they knew that there were two pregnant </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>women there and that even though you were lying on your stomachs, pregnant as you </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>were, they were kicking you?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MRS GXIDI:  People said that there were people who were pregnant and they said </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>that they want these pregnant women, because they are going to give birth to leaders.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>This happened until two in the morning and the police from Queenstown, White police </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>from Queenstown came.  They had a list wanting people who attended the funeral.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>They found others, but they did not find other people who were in the list.  They asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>us one by one questions about our interests to go to the funeral.  I told them that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>parents are in Cradock and I was studying in Cradock, I knew these people.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>then assaulted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a> There was one police by the name of Wanders, who was a Ciskeian police, </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>from Cradock who was necklaced.  They then said that I was one of the people in </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>Cradock who necklaced this police.  They then assaulted me.  After that they released </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>us in the morning.  We were swollen.  We went back home.  Some of them were </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>arrested due to that list.  I went to the doctor, because I was five months pregnant.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>My legs were swollen up and I was working for Buffalo Timber.  I did not go to work </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>on that particular day.  I stayed until the time for me to give birth.  I gave birth.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a> When my child was growing up we did not see anything wrong with this child, </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>but when the child started to attend school he was not grasping anything.  He was </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>doing sub, standard A and I changed schools.  I took him to Dumangeni Mental </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>Hospital in Queenstown to be examined.  A psychiatrist was called and he said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>this situation might be caused by the fact that I was fighting with my child's, child while </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>I was pregnant.  I then said that was not the case, but I told him the whole story.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>child's father, my child is 11 years old now.  I took him to the special school in town.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>He would tear up his clothes at Dumangeni Mental Hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> He came back at home one day and he was injured in his body.  When I took </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>him to the clinic the nurses said that I was careless about the child.  I told them that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>was working, I could not look after him all the time.  In this special school here in </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>town they said that he got onto the tree and he fell, he broke his arm.  He does </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>anything, he, you would get there and he would be bleeding, you will not know what </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>had happened.  I have to look after him.  If something can be done for this child.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>does anything, even to other people.  I am scared that people are going to hurt him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Is he your only child Phumla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>MRS GXIDI:  I have two children.  My eldest is 25 years of age.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>MS CRICHTON:  And the other one is the, is this child that you have been telling us </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Yes, is the 11 year old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>MS CRICHTON:  I just want to ask you a couple of questions now.  You said at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>time you were working for Buffalo Timber.  Did you continue to work for them until </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>you had the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>MRS GXIDI:  I was not working there all the time.  It was a part-time job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>MS CRICHTON:  And until he went to pre-primary school were you unaware that </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>there were problems in his mental health?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MRS GXIDI:  I was not aware.  I thought he was just very naughty.  I was told to </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>stop shouting at him.  I must accept him as he is.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MS CRICHTON:  When you consulted with the psychiatrist and he told you what he </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>did and then you told him the story of what had happened to you when you were taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>off that bus and the beating and assaulting that you had, was his opinion changed, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>did he say then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>MRS GXIDI:  He did not say anything except that he was going to try to put him into </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>a special school.  He took a whole lot of toys, because I told that this child was </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>retarded mentally.  He put a whole lot of toys before him from a year old childrens' </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>toys.  He was about eight or nine years.  He left, he did not enjoy the toys that were </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>appropriate for his age group.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Phumla, I think what I am trying to get at and what I want you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>answer for me is have you ever had any medical opinion given to you that the reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>why this child is as he is, is because of what happened to you when you were pregnant </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>on that bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Well, what I told them is that I never fought with the child's father.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>told them that I had been beaten when I was coming back from Cradock.  They did </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>not say anything after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Phumla, I thank you and the last question that I need to ask you </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>then is I see in your statement you are asking for assistance that this child, Lwando, </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>will be able to attend some kind of special school and have a suitable education.  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>that your request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>MRS GXIDI:  Yes, that is my request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Is there anything further you want to add to what you have said </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MRS GXIDI:  No Mam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Perhaps my colleagues would like to ask some questions.  Madam </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you June.  Are there any questions?  Thank you Mrs Gxidi. </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a> No further questions.  I will ask Mrs Crichton to thank you. </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Phumla, an experience such as you had is one that will live with </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>you for the rest of the life, your life, not only in your memory, but also in the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>of your child and his condition.  We thank you for coming to tell us this story.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>weep with you for what has happened, but we trust that as we move forward, </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>schooling will be found for him and that the Commission will be able to, through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>President's Office, assist in finding the correct place for him to grow to his full </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>potential.  Thank you for coming.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you June.  Thank your Mrs Gxidi.  (Not translated) Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>Jako (not translated Advocate Ntsiki Sandi (not translated).  </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>ADV SANDI:  Thank you Madam Chair.  Mrs Jako, you have a very long story.  As I </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>look at it and the statements and conversing with you on our way to East London </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>yesterday.  Was it in 1962 or 63?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MRS JAKO:  62.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>ADV SANDI:  You were arrested.  The police were looking for your husband.  Is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>so Mrs Jako?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MRS JAKO:  I was not arrested in 1962.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>ADV SANDI:  Let me not lead you.  Please tell us what happened Mrs Jako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>MRS JAKO:  In 1962 I gave birth to my son, Vanele Jako, my third child after I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>miscarried.  After that in December, as I had given birth to my child in July, Special </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>Branch officers came to my house asking for my husband.  They searched my house </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>upside down.  They did as they pleased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>ADV SANDI:  Excuse me Mam, what was your husband's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>MRS JAKO:  Nkululelo Jako.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>ADV SANDI:  Was he a member of a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MRS JAKO:  I did not know at the time that he was a member of a political </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>organisation.  They did not tell me why they were looking for him either.  All they said </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>was that where they found him they were going to kill him, I will never see him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did they find him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MRS JAKO:  No, he skipped the country.  I got a letter after a while. He was using a </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>pseudonyme.  Even my name was a pseudonyme.  I would get letters, registered </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>letters with money.  After a while I did not get any other letters.  They eventually kept </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>the letters to themselves and would not give them to me.  I did not have any money, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>was just sitting at home.  I thought eventually that I should go look for a job.  I went </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>to Majwalena.  These Special Branch officers would come even when I was not there. </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a> I worked there at the hospital at Majwalena.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a> One day, as we did not earn enough money I, we, I spoke with a friend of </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>mine who is referred to as my cousin.  We had to go and ask for money, because we </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>were not earning enough.  We were working for long hours.  We went to ask for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>money.  At the time when we were trying to talk with the workers they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>threatening us saying that they were going to lose their jobs and they were not asking </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>for more money.  We tried to talk to them and negotiate with them.  We concluded to </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>go to ask for more money to the people who were in authority there in the hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>We were told that a certain doctor was not there, Dr Jansen.  He was not there and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>were going to get our answer when he returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a> The doctor returned from where he was and the secretary called us from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>office.  He called all of us, called everybody.  When we got to the office their secretary </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>said that there is a request here that you were looking for more money.  People said </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>that, no, we were not complaining, we did not say that we want more money.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>secretary then asked is there anybody who does not want more money.  Nobody </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>answered.  He said that what we concluded is that we would increase your money </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>with R1,00, if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>ADV SANDI:  Excuse me Mrs Jako, at this time you were not arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MRS JAKO:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>ADV SANDI:  Please tell us about the time when you were arrested and taken to </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>Cambridge.  When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MRS JAKO:  It was when I was working at the hospital, when I was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>ADV SANDI:  Were you arrested because of your involvement in this wage increase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>MRS JAKO:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>ADV SANDI:  Can you please tell us about the day of your arrest when you were sent </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>to Cambridge.  Let us talk about the day of your arrest.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>MRS JAKO:  I was together with one lady I was working with.  We just finished our </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>meal.  We were sitting at home.  They came in, they said that we were looking </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>Shumikazi.  Because I was scared I said I am Shumikazi.  I said why are you looking </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>for me?  They said that we want you.  I was wearing a nightdress at the time.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>told me to dress up.  While I was trying to put on my clothes they told me to wear my </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>clothes quickly and they said that I was a Kaffir maid.  Card was saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did you know who this man was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, people told me who this man was, because when we left my home </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>we met another man who was working in the hospital.  He asked them where are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>taking this woman.  They told him to shut up and we passed him.  These were two </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>White men and the third one was Card.  Card was driving the car.  We then went to </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>Kwaaiman and to Umtata.  It was at night at that time, it was dark.  They then brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>me to Cambridge.  They were hitting me and assaulting me at the time.  The two </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>policemen who were with me at the back of the car.  One of them was pressing my </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>breasts while I would try to car, the other one would put his hands in my mouth.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>then travelled to East London.  They then detained me in Cambridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a> While we were on our way Card would say that I was going to tell them the </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>truth on the following day as I was lying to them.  He said that I was going to tell them </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>where Nkululeka was.  I was taken to the cell.  In the morning they brought us </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>porridge in the cell.  After that they interrogated me.  Card kicked me.  When I woke </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>up I was bleeding.  I had blood all over my body.  Card said that I was going to tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>him the truth.  He asked me where Nkululeko was.  They said that they were looking </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>for Nkululeko and I was not telling them the truth.  I said that I did not know.  I said </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>how could you charge me of something I do not know.  I do not know where </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>Nkululeko was.  They beat me that day and they took me back to the cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>ADV SANDI:  At the time of this assault was there, were there any other police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, there were other White and Black policemen. </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>ADV SANDI:  Were they stopping or were they stopping Card or were they helping </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, they were helping him.  They were also assaulting me.  He would </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>take me to one police and that police would assault me and he would take me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>another police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>ADV SANDI:  When were you released in the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MRS JAKO:  They released me after two days.  They asked me the bus fare.  I told </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>them to take me back home, because they took me at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>ADV SANDI:  Were you ever arrested again after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MRS JAKO:  No, but what they would do was that they were harassing my family all </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>the time.  Everybody who had my surname was harassed.  They grandmother of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>boy behind me was not well, was harassed.  They said that I got married to the, to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>cruel man.  People were scared of me, they could not come near me, because they saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>police vans at home all the time.  Even when I was coming from a holiday in </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>Johannesburg, at eight o' clock in the morning the police would be there next to my </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>house.  I was taken as if I have done something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>ADV SANDI:  You said that under this harassment and your family was also harassed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a> You left this town.  When was this Mrs Jako?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>MRS JAKO:  I went to Johannesburg in 1970 from the Transkei.  I worked in </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>Johannesburg from 1970 until 1976.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>ADV SANDI:  You went to Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, I went to Botswana.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>ADV SANDI:  Were you harassed while you were in Botswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>MRS JAKO:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>ADV SANDI:  Where was your husband, Nkululelo Jako, the one you were talking </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>MRS JAKO:  At the time I was, I went to Botswana he met us in Botswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>ADV SANDI:  Did you go with your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, I went with my two children. I left my younger child behind, </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>because that child was still very young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>ADV SANDI:  At the time how old were these children, the one you took with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>MRS JAKO:  The other one was ten years old and the other was 15 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>ADV SANDI:  Where are these children now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>MRS JAKO:  My one child is married in Swaziland.  The other one is married.  She is </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>in England.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>ADV SANDI:  You came back in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, I came back in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>ADV SANDI:  Where are you staying now Mrs Jako?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>MRS JAKO:  I am staying with my cousin's child.  I do not have a place to stay since I </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>came back.  I have been trying to look for a place to stay.  I am not working.  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>nothing.  It is very difficult for me to get employment.  I do not have a place to stay.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>My husband passed away in England.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>ADV SANDI:  Mrs Jako, would you like to repeat your requests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MRS JAKO:  First of all, I would like my husband's bones to be exhumed.  I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>like my husband's bones to be exhumed, because my husband was fighting for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>country.  I would like his grave to be in this country so that people in this country can </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>be able to see his grave.  Secondly, I would like to be helped to find a place to stay and </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>I would like financial assistance, because I have nothing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>ADV SANDI:  Thank you Mrs Jako.  I could see that that is all you have to say.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>Maybe if there are any questions from my co-panellists, you will be asked questions.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Sandi.  Are there any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>REV FINCA:  Thank you Chairperson.  I would like to ask Mrs Jako did you stay in </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>Tafalehashe in Elliotdale?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes, I got married there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>REV FINCA:  Were you a member of PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>MRS JAKO:  I joined PAC, but at the time I was staying in Tafalehashe I was not a </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>REV FINCA:  Who was the leader there, was it Nkululeko or yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>MRS JAKO:  It was Nkululeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>REV FINCA:  He was the leader in PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>MRS JAKO:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>REV FINCA:  Do you have a knowledge whether a PAC had a policy?  Excuse me </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>Chairperson.  Do you have a knowledge of whether PAC had a policy to rob banks so </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>that it can take this money to send it so that weapons can be bought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>MRS JAKO:  No, I know nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>REV FINCA:  According to your knowledge, nothing like that happened or there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>no policy such as this in the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>MRS JAKO:  No, I know nothing about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>REV FINCA:  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Mrs Jako, I would like to make an announcement that Mr Donald </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>Card, you mentioned in your testimony, sent his statement through his lawyer.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>wanted to answer and to dispute some of the allegations.  Unfortunately, he is not here </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>as he did in the previous days.  I would like to ask Mrs June Crichton to read out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>statement of Mr Donald Card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you Madam Chairperson.  The statement is as follows,</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a> "I, the undersigned, Donald John Card do hereby state </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>I am retired, 68 years of age, and reside at 5 Avon </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>Road, Woodleigh, East London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a> I have been served with a notice by the Truth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>Reconciliation Commission in terms of Act 34 of </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>1995, wherein I am informed that one Shumikazi </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>Sarah Jako will be testifying before the Truth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>Reconciliation Commission and would be implicating </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>me.  Once again, it is difficult to answer to lies when </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>so little information is made available to me by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a> Also, the date makes no sense because from June 1962 </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>to 17 December 1962 I was stationed in Port Elizabeth </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>and did not work in this area at all.  When I returned in </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>December 1962 I was immediately put in charge of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>serious murder case where two young girls had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>burnt to death and then in January 1963 I was sent to </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>Pretoria for over a month.  The name Jako does ring a </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>bell, but I cannot remember if it was a lady from </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>Tafalehashe, near Elliotdale, or a lady from Zwelitsha. </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a> Both these people were connected to a plan brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>from the PAC in exile (Lesotho) by a man by the name </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>of Clippard Komsana.  The PAC required money and </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>plans were set afoot for the Good Hope Textile's </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>wages to be robbed, as also the Debe Neck Post </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>Office.  Both these ladies were involved, but none of </p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>them were assaulted by me or anyone else in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>presence.  The story that they were assaulted in order </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>to establish where there husbands was nonsense, </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>because Clippard Komsana told us all about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>intended robberies, and had a message from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>husband, so there was no reason for assaulting them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a> I cannot believe that the complainants speaks of other </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>policemen, yet only mentions my name.  Why is only </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>my name remembered?  I find it strange that a number </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>of people made false allegations against me and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>request the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>investigate and to find out who is behind this whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>affair and to have those who are found to be making </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>false allegations charged with purgery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a> Signed by Donald John Card.".</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you June.  Mrs Jako, I hope that you have understood this </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>statement and you heard it.  I am going to ask a question.  Clippard Komsana is </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>mentioned here.  Do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>MRS JAKO:  I know Komsana.  After exile I was in Umtata trying to find out about </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>the subsidy, because I wanted a house.  He took me into his car to the taxis as I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>gone to his office.  As we were chatting about Card torturing people he asked me if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>remember Card speaking in Afrikaans, quoting in Afrikaans.  I said I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>understand Afrikaans.  What did Card say I asked.  Card apparently was saying I </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>should be raped.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Where do you know Mr Komsana from?  Did you know him prior </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>to your arrest or did you just meet him in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>MRS JAKO:  I did not know him.  I would hear of him, because he was a PAC </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>member.  I was referred to him, because of the story about the subsidy.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Did you find out where he was when Card was saying you should </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>be raped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>MRS JAKO:  Apparently he was present, but I did not ask him.  I asked my daughter-</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>in-law.  When I was leaving when we were arrested he got in.  My daughter-in-law </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>was together with Komsana.  Komsana had gone to identify him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mrs Jako.  Thank you so much with your story.  As Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>Sandi said, it was long, and it is very painful.  You were just a bride at the time.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>knew nothing about politics.  You did not even know that your husband was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>member of the PAC.  You have given up a lot in your life.  You even left your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>home, went into exile hoping that one day you will be a free woman in your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>country.  However, you came back home with no family, with no job, with no home, </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>you had nothing.  This is very painful.  Thank you for opening your heart up like this </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>before us.  We trust that the requests that you have given us, as we are going to take </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>them before the President, perhaps something can be done for you.  Thank you Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>Jako.  You may take your place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a> We have taken our last ladies.  We want to ask for forgiveness, Mrs Priscilla </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>Maxongo, who was going to give a background and a summary of the struggle for </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>women.  If we can continue tomorrow with her, because of the circumstances.  I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>to thank all the women who gave themselves time to be with us here today.  We thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>especially, because they came here under such circumstances in this weather, </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>struggling, having no electricity lost a lot of hours.  However, they showed a lot of </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>patience, long suffering.  We did not think that you would be here until this time </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>opening up your hearts to hear your stories.  We thank you for the respect that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>have given us.  We want you to know that the intention we had for today, the struggle </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>for liberation is usually perceived as being a mens' world, but I want you to know that </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>we are aware of the contribution women have had to the liberation and the struggle for </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>liberation in this country.  Because of the way we are socialised women mostly stay at </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>home and look after the children, bringing up the children so that the men are able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>be out there.  Unfortunately, because women are socialised to do that and as I perceive </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>it, it is the most important struggle.  If women were not there, the children would </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>suffer a lot.  Women tend to be altruistic in that sense.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a> Men, sons and husbands have lost their lives being shot in the struggle.  We, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>a Commission as well, have listened mostly to men.  We thought we would dedicate </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>this day to you so that you may tell us your stories about yourselves in your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>special day.  We thank you.  We want you to know that in the South African history </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>your stories are very important and documented so that we get all details and nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>is hidden.  We trust that as you have opened your hearts up like this, these stories will </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>play or contribute a lot to reconciliation in our country.  However, lastly, I would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>to say we have won the struggle for liberation, but the struggle for women continues, </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>because we are twice oppressed.  Apartheid oppressed by the police, the past regime.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>Secondly, we are looked as the lower gender.  We want everybody to know that </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>womens' rights are also human rights.  Thank you very much. I am going to hand over </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>to Reverend Finca, telling us what is going to happen with our yesterdays witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>REV FINCA:  Thank you Mrs Chairperson.  We said yesterday that after this hearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>we will try to continue with people left over from yesterday.  However, it is rather late. </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a> We would like to continue tomorrow.  If we could start at nine o' clock tomorrow so </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>that at around 12 we are through.  Thank you Mrs Chairperson.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We close todays hearing.  We will start tomorrow at nine.  </p>
