So he couldn't say anything over the telephone to rectify this, so he said that he'll come to my place and just give me a brief report on what happened at the funeral in Chosa where the funeral was at the Lapus Stadium.

One of the nurses, my neighbour's daughter, she was a nurse there and she opened the space for me to identify him. I first looked at him and I felt his forehead and his neck to make sure if he's really dead, but there was no movement from him.  I could feel that cold has already crept into his body and that's the moment I felt that it's really true, and I had to leave to be alone, to think about it, to understand what had happened, but even then I couldn't understand why this happened to me, why this happened to my family and I just left and stood outside for a while.  Reverend Titus came to me and spoke to me, and the group of us went back to my place.\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 ROBERT KOHL\n Everybody was there now, all the people that I knew and friends, a crowd of people waited at my place and wanted to talk to me.  I was sort of walking, you don't know if you're coming or going actually, it's a sort of feeling that you have that you're not there or you are there or something like that and the principal of the high school came to me and said. \"Don't forget, we still have to report this matter to the police\", and he asked me if I wanted to go with. I felt that I must go with, because the father and I must go to the police station and report this matter.  So the principal, myself, Mr Hillier, and Mr Jerry Akum went to the police station.  Reverend Titus had already left so the four of us went to the police station.\n At the police station we saw these Caspars parked outside, in the yard, all around and people there. A lot of policemen actually.  It was a sort of climate where you could see people were really rejoicing over the sort of victory, the fun they had today, chasing people, shooting people.  They were all happy, shouting, it was the sort of atmosphere that you couldn't understand, but if you're in that situation you feel that they don't actually care about the person that they shot or the people that they shot.\n On entering there was a young constable, he was at the counter also smiling, and when he hears that I said I'm reporting my son's death, the one who was shot.  He asked me where, and I told him, at the funeral down in the township, and his face changed, you could see there was no laughter in his face anymore, he sort of saw that we were really serious in reporting this case.  It took him some time to grab some paper and a pencil and he wrote everything down.

Firstly while the funeral proceedings were on at the stadium, you could see hippos parked all round the stadium and you could see the tops of the hippos where the policemen were sitting on top of the hippos throwing beer cans on to the crowd.  Stones on to the crowd and really the marshals had to handle the crowd not to retaliate in terms of that.\n Then after that the power supply to the stadium was cut off in terms of the P A System and the speakers eventually had to use the loud hailer to address the crowd.\n When the proceedings towards the cemetery took place, there was a delay in front and we later the police prevented the proceedings to continue in the planned route that was agreed upon, and the back of the proceedings moved in another direction and we ultimately heard that the police wanted the front of the group to move in the direction that the back of the group was moving towards.

The planned route was from Pond Street down to Josa Street towards the cemetery.  Then ultimately what happened was that the police wanted to change that and wanted to take the street behind the back of EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n18 T AUSTIN\nthe stadium, Nawo Street, I think that's the street's name.  The police wanted to take that street and then the back of the crowd, without realising what's happening took the initiative and they went towards the street that the police actually decided now during this day.  But when we moved towards that street, I also heard afterwards that there was a councillor staying in that street and the police were like protecting that house there.  The so-called grouping that we went over, we were about twelve, we were about 50 metres back into the crowd, and moving about one minute there was just gunfire all over the place, and people were scattering in all directions and me, Bully and another student comrade that was with us that day, we ran in our direction and the other students, they ran in their direction but it was just unfortunate, or fortunate for me that me and Bully and Aldred was running in the same direction.  It was while we were running that I saw Bully put his hand to the back of his head and I realised that he was running slower, and I actuall helped him run.  When we entered the yard on the opposite side of the street, I realise that he couldn't even clime through a fence line that was that low, and he actually fell and I picked him up and we ran into the toilet.  It was in the toilet that I realised that we had to get him into a house so that he can lie down, because what happened, he was sitting on the toilet seat and he told me that he was getting drowsy, but when I touche his hand  I felt it was getting cold, and I realised that he will have to get to a hospital.\n Now when I carried him into the yard shooting was still going on outside, and when I laid him down, he told me that he was getting cold and I asked the sissy in the house if \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n19 T AUSTIN\nshe could lend me a blanket, which was already on the way without me even asking for it.  But in any case I immediately went outside to go and look for a car, because this auntie in the house told me that she doesn't have a telephone and she doesn't have a car.\n Now when I went outside I was prevented from going into the street by the police and they were asking me what I was doing, you know it was black policemen and I told them that we attended a funeral and we've got a casualty inside here which has to go to the hospital immediately, he's got a wound in the back of his head.  They told me that they have got orders that no one is allowed to go into the streets and I have to go back into the house.
