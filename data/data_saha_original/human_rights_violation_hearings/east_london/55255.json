On the 22nd of May \n1997 I was handed a document from the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission in terms of Act number 34 \nof 1995 wherein it is stated that a certain Mr Vuyani \nMngaza was going to testify before the Commission \nbetween the ninth and 12 of June 1997 and was going \nto implicate me.  I do remember Mr Mngaza as the \nonly garage owner in Duncan Village during the \n1960's.\n In 1965 when a man, who was the messenger for the \nPAC high command in exile (Lesotho) and the \nremaining pockets of PAC members in South Africa \nwas arrested, it became clear that Mr Mngaza played a \nleading role in the activities of the PAC in East \nLondon and, in fact, he was responsible for sending a \nwoman to Lesotho to assist the PAC.  This woman \nand Mr Mngaza were involved in the intended attack \nand killing of Whites throughout South Africa.\n I am not sure whether I or others under me actually \narrested Mr Mngaza, but he was taken into custody \nand later charged.  At no time was Mr Mngaza \nassaulted by me or anyone else in my presence while \nhe was in custody, but on what occasion I did hear that \nMr Mngaza had acted strangely and was taken to the \ndoctor for mental observation.  \n Mr Mngaza was later charged and appeared before the \nSupreme Court in Grahamstown before Judge \nKannemeyer.  Due to the fact that the court felt that \nthere was insufficient evidence to corroborate the main \nState witness, Mr Mngaza was acquitted.  At the trial \nMr Mngaza swore under oath that he was not a \nmember of the PAC and I know notice in Annexure \nEC68/96 that he was a founder member of the Border \nregion of the PAC.  That, of course, says very little for \nhis integrity, but I suppose he will say that he told lies \nto stay out of prison.  So, is he lying now for the sake \nof money.  \n With regard to the allegations on Annexure 68/96, I \nwill deal with them as follows.  Number one, I did not \nknow that there was a Border branch of the PAC in \n1950.  I believed that it was established after 1957.  \nNumber two, I had no dealings with the arrest of Mr \nMngaza in 1963.  In fact, I did not know that he had \nbeen arrested.  Number three, I have no knowledge of \nMr Mngaza's detention and release on the 11th of \nOctober 1963.  Four, in 1963 I was not a member of \nthe Security Police nor did I have dealings with Mr \nMngaza then.  Five, ...\".  \nI am on point number five of Mr Donald John Card's statement about Mr Vuyani \nMngaza.  \n \"In 1963 I did work with Detective- Sergeant \nScheepers, Detective-Constable Chikila, Constable \nBabba Gooysen and Detective-Constable Hans \nMynhardt, but we had nothing to do with Mr Mngaza. \n Sixth, I do remember that Mr Mngaza was sent for \nmental observation, but I cannot remember for how \nlong.  I do remember that he was declared fit for trial \nso do not know whether he was pretending or not.  \nSeven, I have no knowledge of a civil claim.  Eight, the \nAttorney-General has nothing to do with civil claims \nand neither did the Security Police.  These claims are \ndealt with between the claimants advocate, the \nregistrar and the court.  So I find Mr Mngaza's \nstatement very difficult to understand.  Nine, I have no \nknowledge of an application for a passport by Mr \nMngaza.  Ten, to the best of my knowledge, Mr \nMngaza had left this country by 1967 and I do not \nknow about these charges.  11, If my memory serves \nme correctly, our money system in 1967 was in rands \nand not in pounds.  I also do not know of a further \ncharge of sabotage in 1967 against Mr Mngaza.  12, \nMr Mngaza was arrested in 1964 or 65 on a minor \ncharge and was released on R500,00 bail, but when he \nwas re-arrested on a more serious charge, bail was \nopposed and he was kept in custody in East London \nand transferred to Grahamstown for trial before the \nSupreme Court.  13, The trial before Judge \nKannemeyer was in 1965 and not in 1967.  14, I do \nnot know the cost of legal fees, but do know that \nindividuals seldom pay for legal fees when a political \norganisation is involved.  It is again strange that rands \nand not pounds are now quoted.  15, The sale of Pan \nAfrican Motors took place sometime after Mr Mngaza \nwas acquitted and it must have cost a considerable \namount of money to go to Dakar with his whole \nfamily.  16, I did see letters written by Mr Mngaza \nfrom Senegal.  17, I know that the whole family left \nwith him.  18, I did not know that Mr Mngaza had \nreturned to South Africa.  \n I would like to point out that the information supplied \non the Annexure appears to be that of a confused \nperson and honestly does not make sense to me and \ntherefore it is very difficult to answer except to say that \nMr Mngaza was not assaulted by me or anyone else in \nmy presence nor was he badly treated.  He did have to \nwait some time for his trial, but that was a matter for \nthe courts and not the police.  \n Furthermore, I gain the impression that what Mngaza \nis seeking is the R2 650,00 which he says he paid for \nlegal costs.  This appears to be a small amount of \nmoney for an attorney and an advocate's attendance at \na Supreme Court hearing in Grahamstown.  Mr \nMngaza's stated under oath that he was not a PAC \nmember, but it is now obvious that he is once again \nlying in order to substantiate his claims for costs.  \nSigned Donald John Card.\".\nThank you Mr Chairperson.",

            "Again, it is very sad that Mr Card is not here personally so that we \ncan ask him questions according to his statement.  It is also sad that he is, he made a \njudgement about the confusion of Mr Mngaza.  In our eyes we see him as a perfectly \nnormal person, not a confused person, but we will try and get in touch with Mr Card.  \nMaybe in Section 29 hearing so that we can get clarity in what is written in his \nstatement.  He imputed bad motives to Mr Mngaza.  \n We think that we have to close.  The report we got concerning electricity is \nthat this effected the whole Highway area.  It will, this will continue and they hope that \nif the weather is clear tomorrow our proceedings are going to be normal.  If it is not \nthey are going to request a generator to help us.  Tomorrow we have a women hearing \nlooking at issues which involved women in detention.  We have 14 people, were \nsupposed to give their evidence today.  We thought that tomorrow the women hearing \nwill proceed as planned from half past nine.  If we manage to finish in time we will \ncontinue with this hearing tomorrow, but if we have to go through to Friday we will \ndo that and have our hearing up until 12 on Friday.  All the people who are, who were \nsupposed to testify today, we will meet with them tomorrow, but if we did not finish \nwe will meet them on Friday.  We have to listen to everybody, because this is our last \nhearing.  We would like people to be patient with us.  If we knew that there is this \nsituation here in Mdantsane we would have brought our own electricity from Cape \nTown.  It is said that you do not pay electricity here in Mdantsane.  Thank you and we \nwill come tomorrow at half past nine.  \n1",
