<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Our second witness Noxolo Mjila, please come forward.  Your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>sister, Thembisa Mjila, Thembisa Siwale, can also come forward.  Please stand up so </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>that we can take an oath.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>NOXOLO MJILA:  (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>THEMBISA SIWALE:  (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I will now hand over to Dr Magwaza who will lead </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>you with questions.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  If you could forgive me please.  I will speak in English.  Thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>you very much Noxolo and Thembisa for having come forward today to share your </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>story and your experiences.  We welcome you.  Noxolo, could you tell us what </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>happened on the 28th of January 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MRS MJILA:  On the 28th of January 1993 I was with my sister at home, because my </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>husband was working at night on that day.  A day before I spent a night alone.  This </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>day I asked my sister to come and stay with me, because I was scared at night alone.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>Three young men came on this particular day.  One of them stood on the left side and </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>the other one on the right side and the other one in the middle.  It was in Summer in </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>January.  It was about eight o' clock at night.  We were listening to a story in the radio. </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> When these people entered our yard I went to them asking them whether I can help, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>help them.  The other one on the left side said that we are looking for your husband.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>said do you know him, because I did not know these people.  They said that we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>looking for your husband.  I said do you know the person you want?  This man said </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>that he is my friend, I am from NU5.  I said he was not there.  He asked me where he </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>was.  I said he was just around the area.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> I was very scared of these people.  It was clear that they were up to </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>something.  I thought that they wanted money or something or they wanted to rape us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> I was scared of them, because of the way they dressed.  The two of them had, were </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>wearing balaclavas.  The other one was wearing a navy jacket.  Their hairs were </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>dreadlocked.  I said my husband was around the area and it is strange that you say that </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>you are his friend, because I knew all my husband's friends.  I wanted to close the door </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>and this man took out a gun and he pointed me with the gun.  He then shot me in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>shoulder and I felt pain in my arm.  We ran to the bedroom and my sister also followed </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a> They entered the house whilst we were still trying to close the bedroom door.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>We were crying, calling out for our neighbours.  We were asking for forgiveness from </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>them, but they were just shooting the door and he shot me again in the arm as we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>trying to close the door.  My sister was also shot.  Three bullets in the liver, the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>one in the thigh.  I lost strength, because I was shot.  I thought that I was going to die. </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a> They then went through the bedroom saying that we had ADM weapons in the house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> The other one got into my bed.  There was a suitcase on top of the wardrobe.  I had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>comforter in that suitcase.  They were looking for these weapons, but they did not find </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>them in the suitcase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a> At that house, my house was empty, because my daughter-in-law just moved </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>out.  They did not see these weapons.  I gave them the keys so that they can search the </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>house.  They said to me you are going to tell us where your husband is.  They dragged </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>me and I lost consciousness at that time and I regained consciousness outside.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Thank you very much Noxolo for your quite horrendous </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>experience.  Thembisa, is there anything you want to add to what Noxolo has said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>MS SIWALE:  Yes there is.  When we were in the bedroom and they had closed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>door they forcefully entered.  Perhaps I should start back from the door.  I saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>someone there, someone I worked with at the company chemical, member of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>union.  When I saw him I was hopeful, thinking that he would help.  However, he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>forgotten my face.  He could not recognise me.  He is the one who got on the bed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>looked on top of the cupboard and said here these weapons are, these ADM weapons. </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a> He then pulled Lindelwa out.  I know that man, I am not doubting, I could point him </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>out.  There is nothing more I would like to say.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MRS MJILA:  There is something I would like to add.  After we had come back from </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>the hospital the police said they could not take a statement, because I was in pain.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>They then came to my house, took a statement.  A few days later the Mayor, Lulamile </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>Nazo, came.  He was not yet a Mayor then.  He was together with Bonakele.  He said </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>that this case should not be taken to the police as yet.  They are first going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>investigate why this man shot us.  They then said they would come back and tell us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>giving us feedback.  We waited for their response, for their feedback they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>promised.  My father tried to phone Bonakele wanting to know what was going on.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a> We were still in pain.  There was nothing we could do about it.  Bonakele said </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>we should go to the police.  He did not give the reasons as they had promised.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>were not connected to ADM at all.  Both my husband and I were not members of </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>ADM.  We were not members of any organisation.  The police handling the case, </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>Mqombothi, when my father went to him he said that these are cadres that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>dealing with.  We lost hope.  If a policeman was, if a policeman was tentative in </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>helping us then and fearful, there is nothing we could do for ourselves.  Our lives have </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>changed.  I am fearful.  If I am in my home I have to lock the doors all the time.  When </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>I walk around I am scared, because I do not know what they wanted.  I do not know </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>whether they are still watching me.  In my heart I think that they still want to murder </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>me.  That is all. </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Okay, thank you very much.  I will just ask a few clarifying </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>questions.  Can you tell us a bit what this ADM was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>MRS MJILA:  I do not know what ADM stands for.  However, I know that it was an </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>organisation that was present here in Ciskei.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  You are saying that before these people came to your house, </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>you were already scared and you asked your sister to be with you.  What was making </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>you so fearful?  Were you already suspecting that people would come into your </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>MRS MJILA:  As I requested my sister to come stay with me, the reason behind that </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>was that I was not use to being on my own.  My husband was on night shift that </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>particular night.  I would ask anyone to come and spend the night with me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>Sometimes my cousin if I was alone, just to talk to.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Yes, okay.  Were you members of any organisation or was your </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>husband a member of any organisation, political organisation?  Was he involved in </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>MRS MJILA:  No Mam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  No.  Nobody in the family?  You, the people who assaulted </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>were ANC members.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MRS MJILA:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  How did you identify them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MRS MJILA:  My sister recognised the one, a man she had worked with.  Then I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>put two and two together, because this man worked for COSATU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Okay.  One last question.  What do you expect the Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>to do for you, both of you, and your sister?  What are you expecting from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>MRS MJILA:  If the Commission could investigate what, exactly what these people </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>wanted from me, because I am not a member of any political organisation.  There were </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>three men.  I want to know who they are.  It is difficult, the Law must prevail, the Law </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>must take over.  Thirdly, I am injured as a result of the attack.  My arm cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>function well.  It is partially paralysed.  I cannot work properly.  There is a pipe, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>was a pipe inserted inside of me.  I have a synthetic pipe to help the functioning of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>veins to my heart.  My life changed after the incident.  If, somehow, the Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>could help me.  I want to go back to school.  I have a child.  My husband works at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>factory.  He cannot financially support the entire family well enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Okay, one more short question for you Thembisa.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>sustained six bullet wounds.  How is your condition and what did you expect from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>MS SIWALE:  I frequently have to go to the hospital.  It is the bullet that got my liver </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>that damaged my system the most.  I have to go to the hospital most frequently.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>intestines get wound up and entangled.  Also, my left hand does not function well.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>have a weak leg.  I also have a child.  I am a single parent.  My child's father passed </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>away.  It is difficult to get a job because of this operation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  I understand your situation is a difficult one.  We will take your </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>request and take it seriously Thembisa.  Thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Mrs June Crichton has a few questions before you take off your </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>headphones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Actually just one question for Thembisa.  Thembisa, you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>quite clear that you identified the one member of that group of three.  Now, at the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>you were living in NU3.  The incident happened in NU3 where your sister lived.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>are now, I see, are living at NU2.  Do you still see this man that you named in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MS SIWALE:  No, that was the last time I saw him, the day of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>MS CRICHTON:  So as far as you know he is not resident in Mdantsane anymore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>MS SIWALE:  He stays in Sipoenzani.  He was never a Mdantsane resident.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Do you know what kind of work he was doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>MS SIWALE:  He worked in a factory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you Thembisa.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  One question for you Noxolo.  Your husband also knew the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>man that Thembisa recognised.  Let, I am trying to get clarity.  How does he know this </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>man?  Does he know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MRS MJILA:  He actually said he does not know any of the men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Was there a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>MRS MJILA:  A policeman recently came saying he is going to investigate the matter. </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a> I had gone to the police station.  I told them that I had laid charges in 1993, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>nothing had been done.  However, a certain policeman said he is going to investigate </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>the matter.  He tried, but the case was closed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I will hand over to Dr Magwaza to conclude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Again, thank you very much for coming forward.  This is one </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>situation where you became victims in circumstances where you were not involved at </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>all, but nevertheless I think the cause of your strength, your courage, you came out </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>that experience together.  To see you today functioning as you are is a clear sign that </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>whatsoever those people wanted to do to you did not succeed.  I always want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>emphasise the strength.  I know you have suffered a lot.  You cannot work well and </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>function as well as you did before, but I want to say to you in my own mind you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>still very strong people to have come through that experience and to be sitting like this </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>today.  Thank you very much.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will go, proceed with the next witness.</p>
