            "Thank you.  Chairperson, on the 11th of August 1985 I was at home, number three, 76, Scay Street in Duncan Village here in East London.  We were mourning for the death of Mrs Victoria Mxenge.  At about five on that particular day people came, they were coming from Victoria Mxenge's funeral.  They were angry, because the police killed Mrs Victoria Mxenge.  There were rumours that the crowd is going to burn police houses, those who were involved and those who were suspected to work, to be working with the Security Branch Police.  At about five the crowd met the police in Duncan Village and there was conflict.  We slept on that day.\n The following day, on a Monday morning, I was driving my car to work.  I left my wife at home with a car and my children.  When I came back from home, from work at about seven, seven p.m., all the roads to Duncan Village were closed by old cars and other objects.  No car would, no car was supposed to go through Duncan Village.  There were a lot of police.  They were stopping cars not to come to the township, because things were being burnt in the township.  I took my car and I kept it somewhere.  The police could not even go in with their caspirs.  I heard people singing freedom songs.  There was chaos, there was no peace.  \n I could see that there were buildings which were on fire, but I did not know who these buildings belonged to.  I managed to go to my house.  After a while one woman from our community, but I do not know her name, came at home.  She told me that the crowd is coming towards our area and they were singing these freedom songs.  They were going to burn the police.  This lady told us to run away, maybe we will also be affected.  This surprised me, because I was not guilty of anything.  I had nothing against the Comrades.  I never disrupted their attempts to fight for freedom, because I also wanted freedom in this country.  I never killed anyone.  \n At about 20 minutes after that other women came, two women.  I do not know their names.  They took my young children, Nonzoezo, Mandla Inkosi and Zoliswa.  They took them with them.  They told us that they were going to protect these children, because the crowd was coming to this house.  My son Napayi who was still very young followed them.  I saw him jumping the fence and running away.  He went to the bush.  I told my wife that we must cover ourselves with blankets and switch off the lights and leave the house.  We then did that.  These people were in our yard at this time.  Some of them saying that we must burn this person.  Others tried to stop saying that this person was innocent.  They argued.  Most of them were against this decision.  \n We covered ourselves with these blankets and we went with them to the street.  They did not recognise us.  Some of them were saying that we must not be burnt down.  We then went to a secure place in the bush.  On that night we stayed there in the bush waiting for what will happen.  On the following day on the 13th, four a.m., we saw that our house was on fire.  We came nearer.  We saw that my car, a bakkie, was also burnt.",

We have problems with electricity, as you know, so I am going to ask you a couple of questions now and I would like you just to answer me.
