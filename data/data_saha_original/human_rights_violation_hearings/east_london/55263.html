<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How were you related to Deliswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> My daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Could you briefly tell us what happened on this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> It was in 1981 on the eighth of November.  They were going to go to a funeral where Thozamile Qoto's parents had passed away in Pilton.  She left in the morning to go to the funeral.  In the afternoon, late afternoon, before sunset, I was going to go to a church service, but I just did not feel good so I did not go.  At about five o' clock the first person to enter my house was Toto Ngqeza who is sitting next to me.  He got into the house, walked to the kitchen.  He looked at me strangely with everybody around.  I asked if they had all come back from the funeral.  He said that something had happened, however, at Highway.  There were shootings.  I asked where Deliswa was.  He looked around.  Toto, where is Deliswa, I asked, where did you leave them?  I went towards the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> One of my sons walked in.  He looked morbid.  I asked Toto for the third time where Deliswa was.  He then said she has been injured, she had been shot.  I walked out, walked towards the gate, but I went back into the house.  I walked around the street.  I wanted to go to where she had been shot.  I asked Toto where my daughter was.  He said that they had taken her.  My husband arrived from a meeting.  There were people who heard the news at Highway, they also came.  They thought that they should go to the police station as Toto had given a report that Deliswa had been taken by the police.  I wanted to go, but I was told to stay.   I went to the taxi somehow, but then got back home.  I was going up and down, I did not know what I was doing, frantic.  Eventually I settled down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> They came back at about ten in the, at night saying they are from the police station.  They could not get any leads.  They were told to come back the next morning.  They went to the police station, they did not get any proper leads.  On the Tuesday they were told that my daughter had passed on.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there unrest in the township at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> At the funeral in Pilton the Ciskeians came, harassed the mourners.  When the busses were coming to Mdantsane, Highway the Ciskeians started shooting at the busses that had gone to the funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Has the, was there any witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> There were a lot of witnesses.  People who saw Deliswa being shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When you found out about her death what did you do?  Was there a post mortem?  Did the police harass you before and during the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> The police would come to our house harassing us.  We could not rest.  The corpse was with the police.  Everything was done according to the, to their desires.  Eventually they gave the corpse back to us to bury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How old was Deliswa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> She was 19 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was she at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> She was looking for a job.  She was helping a the SADWU offices where she had joined the union.  She had gotten a job at J &amp; J.  She was going to start working on the ninth.  However, she passed away on the eighth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Apparently, you were sent to an office at Bisho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> A Ford Sierra was sent to our house and we were called to this police station.  I cannot remember whether it was after the case had been postponed.  She got injured and shot before Ciskei was independent.  This man with the Ford Sierra said that we must go to Bisho.  However, we must first go to NU1.  Mr Errol Sebe kept on postponing.  I was suffering from tonsillitis when an elderly man, dark in complexion, with glasses with a Ford Sierra came to my house.  He got into the house with documentation.  He was talking to my husband in the lounge.  I said that my husband should handle the matter, because I was suffering from tonsillitis, I went to my bedroom.  He, this man said that he had been sent from Bisho to tell us that we were going to be called in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> He asked what had happened, if we got any form of help after my child had passed on.  We told him that nothing had happened.  He said that the Government was supposed to help or supposed to do something at the least, because he had also stated that this child had passed on and been shot accidentally.  After this man had left nothing happened.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know who this man was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did he say who he had been sent from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> He said that he was sent from the Government offices in Bisho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> After the case had been postponed nothing happened.  I said to my husband we should go to Siwisa.  We went to Siwisa, but to cut this short, after I came back from Siwisa I do not know what happened.  I fell ill.  I got very nervous that night and I went to bed.  As I was sleeping I heard a voice asking me why I had gone to an attorney, because Maria never went to an attorney, Mary never went to an attorney even though she saw her son being harassed and ill-treated.  I woke up from my sleep.  I started praying, asking the Lord for forgiveness.  I was not supposed to have gone to a legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> During the times when I was surrounded by enemies, my Lord was always with me on, at my side.  He spoke then and even now he was speaking.  I asked for forgiveness for having gone to an attorney.  I got up after having prayed.  I said to my husband we should leave everything to rest, because so much had been revealed to me.  I did not know whether the Lord had taken my child for a reason that he had seen in me.  The Lord is always with me, in all situations.  I asked the Lord to heal my wound and His will be done and I surrender like Mary.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> In conclusion, even after I had given the statement I thought I was not going to come before the Commission, but I had to come.  Even as I sit here I have not come to lay charges.  The word that the Lord had given me is still in my heart.  I got the word from Isaiah 53, Mark 4, Luke 2:46.  When I read those Scriptures not knowing what to do, but the Lord spoke.  Even as I sit here I surrender all to the Lord.  I hold no grudge.  I am waiting on the Lord and the work He did through this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mam.  I just have two short questions.  The statement before us declares that there was an inquest and a police was guilty and somebody asked for forgiveness at the Government offices.  Could you briefly tell us about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> I have no knowledge of the policeman that asked for forgiveness.  All I know is that it is Mcanyangwa killed Deliswa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened to Mcanyangwa?  Was he prosecuted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> He was not prosecuted.  He had carried on interrogating my children, harassing them.  My child ended up an exile in Cape Town.  He said that it is him who had burnt down his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is Toto going to say anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQEZA:</span> Mr Chairperson, there is nothing new I would like to add except if the Commission would have questions to ask me.  According to my statement I will answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When Deliswa was shot where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGQEZA:</span> I was not there, I was at NU7.  I was one of the people that prepared for Thozamile Qoto's funeral, but I told the Comrades that I would not be able to go back to the funeral.  One of the reasons why I was not going to be able to go to the funeral was because the police was aware that I was in the struggle and I did not want to be exposed.  From unit seven in Mdantsane I saw people at the highway.  I asked what was going on.  They said that a Comrade had been shot.  I tried to find out.  Some had said she works at Johnson &amp; Johnson.  The others said they do not know.  As a Johnson &amp; Johnson worker I was interested and wanted to know who it was.  At the end of the day I found out it was Deliswa, my own cousin.  I went home to report as my aunt has just said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  I am going to hand you over to the Chairperson.  Maybe there are questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to ask one question.  Mrs Roxiso, in this written statement you have requests.  You wish the Commission to investigate this matter.  I want to know if it is so, because according to your evidence today you do not want this to be, happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS ROXISO:</span> Well, the perpetrator denied the whole matter even though there were witnesses.  If he could come forward and admit to this act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mam, thank you Toto for the evidence that you put before us today.  Evidently it is your faith that gave you strength during the hard times.  Thank you for putting forward your evidence in the manner you have done.  I trust that we are going to be able to have access to the inquest records in order to bring this matter to completion.  We may succeed in this, we may not, but we will try.  Thank you for your courage for coming before the Commission.</p>
