They have also contributed a lot for the liberation of this country.  We thank you for bringing forward these painful stories to the Commission.\n One person said tomorrow, yesterday that maybe the Commission will not do anything.  It will just hand over a report to the President, but we cannot deny the fact that this process of the Truth Commission has given people a chance to come forward and to tell the whole country about what happened to them.
