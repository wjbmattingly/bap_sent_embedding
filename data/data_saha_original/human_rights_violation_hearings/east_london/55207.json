            "We welcome you warmly at this first of the series of public hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  This is a hearing of the Commission on human rights violations.  The other type of hearing is that of the Amnesty Committee.\nWe thank our Eastern Cape colleagues, Commissioner, Commissioner Bongani Finca and all his colleagues in this region for their very hard work, demonstrating that I head up a team of outstanding persons as Commissioners and Committee members, some of whom are here with me today.\n Our staff consists of dedicated and skilled persons.  We thank the Premier of this province, the honourable Raymond Mhlaba and the people of his province for their welcome and for their presence here today with Mrs Mhlaba as well as the speaker of the Provincial Legislature, Mr Kugile and Mrs Kugile.  We thank the mayor, the councillors and the people of East London for their welcome, and especially for making available these facilities here.\n We want to say a big thank you to the police for providing security, as we can see.  They are our police. We welcome all those who will be telling their stories as well as their relatives and friends.  We will want to hear their stories.  That is the basic reason for these hearings. For the Human Rights Violations Committee to help the Commission EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 MOHAPE\ndetermine whether a particular person has suffered gross violations  of their human rights and for those people then to be declared victims and who will thereafter be referred to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee of our Commission, which then must make a appropriate recommendations to the President of our country for the nature and size of reparation to be given.  \n The Committee will not be making immediate findings about whether people are victims who have suffered gross human rights violations. But it's something that will happen only a while afterwards, because it may be necessary to verify testimony, we may have to alert people who have been named as alleged perpetrators so that they are given an opportunity of making representations in writing and possibly being asked to come to a future hearing.\n Thank you all of you here in South Africa and around the world who have prayed and are praying for the Commission and its work. We are charged to unearth the truth about our dark past, to lay the ghosts of that past so that they will not returned to haunt us and that will thereby contribute to the healing of the traumatised and wounded people for all of us in South Africa are wounded people. And in this manner to promote national unity and reconciliation.  For Christians it is a significant thing.  Now the first hearing happened at Easter time, when we commemorate the victory of life over death, of light over darkness, of goodness over evil, of justice over injustice, of truth over lies, of laughter, of joy, of peace of compassion over their ghastly counter parts in the glorious resurrection of saviour Jesus Christ.\n We want to indicate that those who testify before this Commission, will enjoy the same privilege as would happen in EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 MOHAPE\na court of law for the testimony that they give, provided what they say is the truth as they understand it, and provided what they have done is done in good faith.  \n We want to assure that we do not want to turn the hearing into proceedings of a court of law, but the conduct of all of us here should be conducive to a dignified hearing, for we have come especially to hear harrowing stories from those who are going to be witnesses, and out of respect for them, I hope that it will not be necessary for me to invoke the powers that have been given to me by the Act, that each of us here will conduct themselves in an appropriate manner. If people who hear what would be construed in a court of law, if it happened there, as contempt of court, then they will be guilty of an offence. I would hope that it would not be necessary for us to go in that direction.",

EAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n5 MOHAPE\nAfter some time our house was attacked by police every time in and out seeking for him.  They also wanted me in the process because he was a person who could reach out to people and even at home he was a person who could be reached easily. He was being sought by the police, what for, nobody knew.  My mum was also involved here and he knew exactly how to reply to the police. \n Even before we got married, they would even go to my home, my house,  to search for him. He was in those difficult times.\n Now on his way to the workshop, he said to me, \"I am not going to leave you, let's go together, because we are busy here getting our country in order\". Now, well be in East London, we'll be in Cape and we'll be in Durban, because he was a member of the South African Student Organisation at Turfloop.  In 1972 there was a big strike at Turfloop and then he was removed, that time they were busy mobilising their community. During that time Steve Biko was also banned and then he came back to Tqonre, they were people working together. At times they would hold meetings, Steve would be there, Bunny would be there. I was still young, they would say to us, \"We want to conceptonise you, you have to know exactly who you are, where your origin is, you should be very proud of your origin\".  They would even make noise, telling us to stop imitating whites, we are busy smearing our faces with creams, because we want to be like whites, we're busy stretching our hair because we want it to be long. \"You are beautiful as you are.  We recognise you as you are, don't try to imitate other cultures so that you become beautiful, it's not important to us, you are a human being\".\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n6 MOHAPE\nIn 1974 we had our first daughter. While I was pregnant her father was detained.  Even when giving birth to the child, the father was not there, he was at a conference. He told me that he would be in the meeting. I was very expectant at the time.

After the seventh mont father Stubbs was a person who really tried to help.  He said I should go to Pretoria but seems as if Mapetla is in Pretoria, they would\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n8 MOHAPE\ntry by all means to find some means of singing.  We went to Central Prison in Pretoria and then I would stay there for the whole week, every morning going to Pretoria since our prison with my lawyers wanting to see my husband, but never.\n In the second week I was told that I can see my husband for only two minutes, because I said to them, nobody can only disappear without any reason.  We it's things that are happening in our area.  I even told them that we read about people who get hijacked in the showers in the prison.  I just read in the newspaper about a person who fell from a chair and died, but in actual fact you'd have the feeling that the person is still alive.  Then you'd only see the person for two minutes if you are given a chance.  That's what happened during those days, in the seven months that he was inside. Do you remember the Act, tell us under which Act he was detained. What did they say to you.  Every time police would come and arrest Mapetla and they would say, under Section Six of the Terrorism Act. In that section, I knew exactly about it.  As I've already said, some of their things,   (end of tape 1)\n(start of tape 2) and it was hopeful that everything was going on so well.  When you were making your own judgement you would say these policemen had been trapped, but when the results came out and nobody was accused and found guilty about this death, it was said Mapetla had committed suicide.   We were not that shocked because we expected that, as we always knew about the courts of South Africa.  We were very angry about this. I could not control my anger, I was so emotional that I vowed that I am going to show these people.  And I was also aware that I have to be protected against myself, but I was helpless at the same time.  I was \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n9 MOHAPE\ndejected, I was hopeless and I vowed to myself as they said that they have finished with me, and that were thinking that this struggle would not continue, I rejected that and I was sure that was going on strongly with the struggle.\n I also emphasised the fact that the plans which were laid out by my husband are going to be carried out.  At times he used to go on Sundays and he would say we must go and scout around for beautiful houses in the town in King Williamstown.  We would go around and look at each beautiful house where he would say, \"These Boers, where they stay, we are going to own that house one day\".

But because I was labelled as being a wife to a terrorist, I never got a chance to be a teacher.  Well I was forced to be involved in a self-help project for a black community but I was thankful because I learned a lot.  I was more empowered when I didn't work as a teacher.  With community programmes you were able to know how to be dedicated, how to be committed to what you were doing, and also were able to learn how you can empower people, so that they not dependent on others.  \n There were so many projects which we opened and I also learned very much from that.  The contribution that I have done is more than being a teacher.  And this give me a chance to teach people responsibility and we learned also to empower people. It was enjoyable to me because teaching would not have given me that opportunity. I continued working as a black community leader, and all the organisations were banned in 1977.\n What happened when I was thinking that I am already now past all these tortures, a new era started when the police kept on harassing me, coming to my house and I think they were trying to remove the spirit and dampen my spirit, so that I cannot go on.  They tried to tempt me, trying to show me all the benefits that I would gain if I would change into being an informer.  The policemen continued to tell me that they would even take me to far away places like overseas and they said they would pay for everything, and they also said that they belonged to BOSS, an independent body which was working together with the people to develop and support them.\n I cannot also state where exactly this comes from, but it was a bureau which was reported to be helpful to some \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n12 MOHAPE\npeople who had been oppressed, and they also chose me as one of the candidates who could go and get a bursary to go overseas.  They also told me that they would give me a tape recorder so that I can record everybody wherever I go.  I should attend meetings, attend workshops, and do recordings for them so that I can appear as leisurely but I would be knowing that I am developing my skills. I think that was their psychological way of working through my feelings but we didn't go well together.  \n Because I refused their offers, they kept on coming again, they started detaining me, again and again, and I was the secretary to Steve at the time. Steve was arrested in Port Elizabeth and I also suffered the consequences, because I was detained because I was his secretary,   There were three of us.  I stayed there in detention, in solitary confinement for six months and I could really confirm and believe what was said about what happened in the police cells. I was not even given a chance to go and change and take new clothes to make arrangements for what was happening to my children, I didn't even have a opportunity to get a baby sitter.  They told me that they can take me anywhere and they could also make it happen so that nobody can know where I've gone to.  I went to Port Elizabeth and I also spent six months in detention.\n The first month during my detention, I didn't get a drop of water to wash myself, I was unable to change and I was in my menstrual cycle.  I was so dirty, requested water so that I can bathe and wash myself.  But nobody wanted to help me.  They even refused me access to the magistrate. I told the magistrate about all these atrocities and the fact that I have even had lice as I couldn't wash myself. This \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n13 MOHAPE\nwas the third of fourth day, but the magistrate gave an order that I should be given some toiletries.   After a month I was allowed to get some items from home to change.  I was alone at Mount Road, a police station with very few cells.  There are two very small cells, painted black.  It was a very dark place, there is a bucket inside and they would come and fetch you at night and take you to SANLAM Building.  That is where the atrocities used to take place.\n We would be assaulted and forced to tell the truth, and  I was also forced to say that Steve is a terrorist, and also that he was busy distributing pamphlets.  So I had to admit that I was supposed to cyclostyle a batch of pamphlets for Steve.  During that period that I was going to distribute them, he was arrested. \n During the six months, everything was revolving around Steve Biko.  At times they would bring blank papers so that I could sign, and they promised to release me, if I should sign them.  But they asked me if I wanted the same thing to happen as happened to my husband?  At times I would be fastened to a grill and then would be assaulted brutally and would be unable to defend myself.  There was not even a chance to run away because the grill holds you so fast that you cannot do anything about it.\n After they beat you, they would beat you and find out if you don't want to go and relieve yourself.

I had to take my children to my in laws again. After another week I was released again.  Thereafter my in\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n15 MOHAPE\nlaws preferred that I should leave the children so that they cannot be affected by these removals.  I took the children and they stayed with my in laws.  The children were attending school at the time but because I was under a banning order I was unable to visit them.  I was not even to take them to school and could not escort my little one to school like any other parent.  It was difficult for me to do so.  I was unable to attend the meetings which were attended by other parents.  I was unable to get jobs and I was labelled as a terrorist then.  I was restricted from being in the company of more than two people.\n It was a very difficult time for me and I was unable to get employment anywhere.  The banning order was for 1978.  In 1979 I got a job in a furniture shop.  I was employed for five days and the police came again at Elerines where I was working and they took me again. I was given an envelope. I was paid for the five days that I worked and was told that the job was finished.",

This project started in 1971, the people did it for themselves and were also encouraged by Steve Biko. and this Committee was trying to make the Ginsberg community to be able to have their children to be taken to school.  Those were children who were needy were given bursaries and scholarships so that they can be able to continue with their education. For the\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n16 MOHAPE\nfamilies who were removed from their areas, this was also a benefit for them.  So I was working on this project.",

I also recommend the support of the people who worked with him.  The members of organisations.  Even the people world wide, he received letters from overseas, from people you do not know, even in this country people were sending letters, feeling this hurt together with you, you know these hard times that we were in, the people were together with us.  That gave me strength, that I am supported by the people.  Let me not disappoint them, let me carry on with the struggle and see whether my life reaches the point I want it to reach.\n Now wit this Truth Commission, I've realised that people from overseas, and these people that have been supporting me, I want them to hear today what happened. I am here with a full hope that my children, after such atrocities, will know exactly what happened, because my children and I, we told them that we their father didn't kill himself.",

            "After the death of Mapetla I was full of hate. I was full of hate that can never be countered. I was hating anybody who was in the police.  I hated them for their\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n17 MOHAPE\noppression.  Those were the people who were enforcing apartheid laws on us. They wanted us not to have rights.  Even the children, when you speak to them, you have to tell them these are the people who oppressed us, but one day they will change.  Now these police who are forcing apartheid laws on us will change.  \n That hate stayed with me.  Even that heavy load in my heart was also there, but I told myself that life must continue, I have to be very patient.  Even if I was full of hate, life continued.  You know, even if you don't forget this, even if you don't forget that Mapetla is dead, the children will wake him.  We agreed that this is a nice thing if we agreed as a family that we will go to the TRC and speak out about what happened.  The way we see things. The hard times that we went through.. We want to share with you the difficult times that we've been through.  \n I want to repeat, my hope is that the TRC will reveal, will try to find out what happened to their father, so that when my children are elderly people, they will know exactly what happened to their father. I think I should also know what happened, because as I am sitting here now, I don't know what happened, because he never had any grudges, he belonged to the people.  He was abducted from his house, healthy, supporting his family under the people who followed him.  I have the experience of being tortured, which he also went through.
