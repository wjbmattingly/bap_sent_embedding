<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  If we could change our order.  If Nosipho Blossom Marwezu, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>number 12, could come forward please.  Nosipho, please stand up to be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>NOSIPHO BLOSSOM MARWEZU:  (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We just want to clarify that the reason we called you, it is because </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>there is an attorney, a legal representative of an alleged perpetrator.  We had given him </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>a notice.  So I am going to ask you questions.  The story you are about today is about </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>yourself, what happened to you on the 18th of June 1986.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  You were seven months pregnant at that time, arrested, tortured.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Could you tell us what was happening at this time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Should I start with my arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you got arrested.  Why were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  In 1985 I was a student at Qaqamba doing my standard nine.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>There were riots at Duncan Village.  The police then would regularly come to my </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>home looking for me.  I got a message that the police are looking for me.  I left and </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>stayed at Mdantsane, NU15, with my sister.  My mother said that I must just go and </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>surrender to the police, because she could not sleep, the police were regularly there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>They were going to arrest her if I did not give myself up to the police.  I then said I </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>would go to the Cambridge Police Station.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> Heather, my sister, said that I should go to Cape Town to my eldest sister.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>truly went to Cape Town.  I stayed there in 1985.  In 1986, May, I came back.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>thought that, perhaps, everything had subsided.  On the 18th of June I was at home </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>sleeping.  There was a knock at the door.  It is the police.  It was at about one or two </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>a.m.  My mother opened the door.  When they got in they did not say anything to my </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>mother.  They were with a policeman who knows me, Mandisi Mbewana.  They could </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>not see me, because I had covered myself.  They said to my mother that they are going </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>to arrest her if they cannot find me.  They then took me.  However, they took my two </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>other brothers as well, Thembinkosi and Mbuyiseli, who is late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a> I was in pyjamas.  They did not even let me change.  When I got outside I saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>a caspar.  They put me into that caspar.  It was packed with people.  They were </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>probably going around collecting people.  They took us to a place called Strongpoint </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>where the soldiers are in Duncan Village.  The next morning we were taken to </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>Cambridge.  The Captain asked what the charges were.  This man then responded in </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>saying that he does not know.  He was just given a list to arrest all the people.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>Mbewana came saying that he wants all of us at Westbank.  Then there was a State of </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>Emergency.  We were taken to Westbank.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Is this Mandisi Mbewana or the elder one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Mandisi is the younger one who arrested me.  The one who said </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>we must go to Westbank is the elder one.  We could not even get visitors for two </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>months.  They had arrested me, I was in pyjamas.  I was using the clothes that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>provided me in prison.  I was three months pregnant.  Then the interrogation started.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>They took us one by one to Cambridge.  They asked me if I knew that COSAS had </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>been banned.  I said yes.  So they asked me why I worked for COSAS even though it </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>had been banned.  I said I did no such.  They then said that I was a member at, of </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>COSAS at Qaqamba.  They asked if I know that the riots at Duncan Village were all </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>inspired by Qaqamba students.  They asked who had burnt down a policeman's house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a> I said I did not know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a> They took me back to the cell.  They called me back.  I did not know I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>going to go there.  I was going to Frere Hospital regularly at that time.  They said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>I am supposed to go to the Frere Hospital.  I told them that I had no appointment </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>there.  Nomsa's attorney, a co-prisoner, gave me her headscarf to put on.  I put it on.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>They took me to Cambridge to an office there.  Mr Mpumelelo Madliwa was there </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>and Mpumelelo Nkonzombi.  They asked me who had burnt down his house.  I said I </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>do not know.  They strangled me.  They pulled down my headscarf, put it around my </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>neck.  The one pulled from the left and the other from the right.  I lost all strength.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>urinated on myself.  I was pregnant at the time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> They said I must tell the truth, who burnt the house down.  I said it was me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>Who else?  I said by myself.  They told me that I was lying.  They put down the </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>headscarf and they strangled me with their own hands.  They were not beating me up, </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>just strangling me.  What happened is that my eyes went red.  They then took me to, </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>back to Westbank Prison.  When I got there I was not taken to a cell where the others </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>were.  I was taken to solitary confinement.  My eyes were red.  I saw nobody but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>police.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  How long were you in prison by then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  It was around September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  You had been arrested in June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  You were on your own.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  They would take me to the Frere Hospital at the clinic there </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>regularly.  From solitary confinement they took me to Cambridge again.  A police car </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>came to fetch me.  I got there.  There were chairs outside.  They made me sit there for </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>such a long time that I thought they had forgotten about me.  After a while Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>Mbewana said I must go into his office.  He did not settle down, he just, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>walking in and out.  A White policeman called Radue came.  This man bowed down, </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>took something from under the table then left.  After a short while there was a bang.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>did not know whether I was being shot.  I did not know what was happening.  I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>fell down.  After a long while I got up.  I could see I was on my own.  They came </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>back.  They asked what it was.  I said I did not know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  So what was the bang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  I do not know even to this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  So when you had gotten up this policeman, Glen Henry Radue, </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>was not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  No.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  How did you get released?  How did that come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  On the sixth of December, after the bang, I was taken back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>prison.  It happened that in my being shocked I started hurting, contractions.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>then taken to hospital.  I gave birth to a premature child at seven months.  There was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>policeman at my side all the time.  I got out, back to the prison with my child, </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>Thinasonke.  In the morning they went, when the police would come and count us </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>they would take my child and bring the baby back late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  When did you go back to the cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  After my child was five days old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Where would you sleep at the cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  On the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  With the baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  After they had taken the child do you know who looked after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>child, who fed the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  No, when I would ask they would say that they would take the </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>child to the creche.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What happened eventually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Until such time when they felt like releasing me they just released </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What month was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  It was in 1987.  I cannot remember whether it was March or </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>April.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  How old was the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  How old were you when this all happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  I was 20 years of age in 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Were you politically active at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes, I was a COSAS member before COSAS was banned and </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>then after that it was banned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore, no charges were laid on you?  That was the end of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>harassment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  They put me into a car and took me to a taxi rank.  They told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>that the people that you had been arrested with were still in jail.  I was the only one </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>who had been released.  If two people come to my house and you are the third one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore that is a political meeting and they were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>rearrest me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  No, not my family members, but visitors.  I would have to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>one visitor at a time.  If it is two, more than one then it would be taken as I am holding </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Who would take you from Cambridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  There was a policeman called Solly.  I do not know whether that </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>is his first name or his last name.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  He would just drive you around to the places they took you to.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>never did anything to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  No, he did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Who beat you or harassed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Madliwa and Nkonzombi.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What is his first name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Both their first names are Mpumelelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  These are the people who were strangling you with a head scarf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Did they do anything else to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  No.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore they have both strangled you and released you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Nosipho.  Perhaps there are questions from my co-</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>panellists.  Dr Magwaza will ask just one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Today the focus of our hearings is on how women were treated </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>and violated.  In your case we have a typical case of a woman who was violated not </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>only by torture, but who was also violated by just being a woman, a woman.  You say </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>your baby was taken away from you.  You say that you were tortured when you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>pregnant, you were strangled when you were pregnant.  They were almost strangling </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>two people not one person.  How, what was your, what was the attitude of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>torturers to you when you were pregnant?  Did they say any nasty things to you?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>How did they treat you when you were actually pregnant, before you had your baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Yes, first of all, when I was arrested Mpumelelo Madliwa did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>know Nosipho Marwezu, myself.  They asked if they had found Nosipho.  Mandisi </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>Mbewana then said here she is.  Mpumelelo Madliwa then said we have wasted a lot </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>of money, the Government's money has been wasted.  They were using the </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>Government's money looking for me.  He swore at me.  When they were strangling me </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>at Cambridge he swore at me yet again, saying I am a bitch, I am going to tell the truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>whether I like it or not.  I gave them the truth that was not really.  I said that because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>wanted them to lay charges on me, because I had had enough of being imprisoned.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  So, what they said to you, something that would apply </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>specifically to a woman which they would not have said to a man, was that they called </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>you a bitch?  Is that what you are saying?  If you were a man they would not have said </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>that to you.  Is it all they said to you, that is something they would have said </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>specifically to a woman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Well, they said much more, but I cannot repeat those swear </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>words.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>PROF MAGWAZA:  Okay, we respect that.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  June Crichton has a few more questions for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you Madam Chair.  I just have two questions for you for </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>clarification, Mrs Marwezu.  The first one is did you know Nkonzombi or Mbewana </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>before the arrest and the torture?  Did you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  I knew him well.  Mr Mbewana was my father's friend.  He, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>were neighbours.  My father called him uncle.  I was born before him.  I was shocked </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>in the way he treated me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you.  My second question to you was did anybody assault </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>you in the presence of or with the help of Nkonzombi or Mbewana during your </p>

<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  There were other policemen from Cambridge.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Do you know who they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>MRS MARWEZU:  Nkonzombi and Madliwa, that is all I know.  I do not know the </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>other peoples' names. </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>MS CRICHTON:  Thank you.  I hand over to you Madam Chair.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Nosipho, thank you so much for sharing your painful story with us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a> Perhaps some other people, especially people who are not women, they do not know </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>the significance of giving birth to a child.  I do not know how it would be to give birth </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>to a child and have to keep that child in the first few months in prison.  Your story is </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>very painful especially because your baby would be taken from you for the whole day. </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a> Dr Magwaza has already said that some of us are not oppressed because we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>human beings, just mere human beings, but because we are women, but, and we, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>women, have suffered in a way that men, perhaps, can never understand and I hope </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>that the men in this hall are listening so that this does not happen again in future.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>Thank you so much.</p>
