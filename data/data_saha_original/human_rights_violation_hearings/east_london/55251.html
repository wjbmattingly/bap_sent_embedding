<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>OPENING PRAYER</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We will call Priscilla.  Priscilla, I have forgotten your surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>MS MAXONGO:  I am Maxongo, Maxongo.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We welcome you Priscilla.  Thank you for coming here and give us </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>few words about the struggle of women in this region.  We could not get anyone, </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>because we knew, we know that you have played a leading role in that struggle.  I will </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>now hand over to you to give us your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>MS MAXONGO:  Thank you Reverend.  Let me greet you Reverend and people in </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>the panel together with everybody present here.  I would like to thank this opportunity, </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>I was given this opportunity after Sisan Jikilane, who was testifying here, he was my </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>leader in the trade union.  Chairperson, I am not going to say a lot, but I will just tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>you briefly what happened.  I am worried, because I was supposed to testify yesterday, </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>but because of the situation here in Mdantsane I could not testify yesterday.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>speech would make sense if I testified yesterday, because yesterday was women's day. </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> Women in South Africa have struggled.  That is what I wanted to say yesterday.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>wanted to clarify this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> Women were involved in the struggle.  They started in the bus boycott and in </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>the trade unions.  Because it was very difficult for us to be involved in the struggle we </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>had to form different other organisations.  We did not want to depend on the trade </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>union only.  We formed our own committees.  We were going to be joined to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>community organisations.  We started with UWO, United Womens' Organisation, </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>which was a national organisation.  We worked together with the trade union, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>we were also workers.  We wanted to be liberated.  This is, this was our strategy.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>continued as UWO as women and we supported the bus boycott.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> At that time in the Committee of Ten, I was one of the members.  There were </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>only two women in that committee.  Eight of the other members were men.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>continued in this committee.  I am not, I do not want to talk a lot about the bus </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>boycott, because Sisan has already given you that information, but what I would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>to say is that we were fighting against the increase of five cents.  They called it 11%.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>We as workers, we were not aware of this 11%, but we found out that the difference </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>was five cents.  People were killed, Chairperson.  I am here today, because I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>testify on that.  People were shot.  I heard about this while I was in prison, because in </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>1983 I was detained in NU1.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a> The bus boycott started on the first of July.  On the second day people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>supporting the bus boycott and the leaders of that bus boycott were detained.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>aim, Chairperson, was that as the leaders were being detained people would go and </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>use the busses, because they thought that the leaders were the ones stopping people </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>from using busses.  We were detained as members of the Committee of Ten in NU1 </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>together with other members of SAWU, who were suspected to be the ones </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>supporting the bus boycott.  People were strong and they knew where we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>detained.  The police would come to our cells, Chairperson.  They would tell us that </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>the bus boycott was over.  I would say that, we would say that they were not telling us </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a> I was amongst these men.  Everybody who was a leader was arrested at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>time.  Chairperson, we were inside at the time.  I would like to repeat that people </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>supported the bus boycott.  The leaders were all inside, they were arrested.  I became </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>ill in the prison cell.  After I ate my meal, as the detainees, as detainees we would eat </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>food from different hospitals and on this particular day all the leaders were there and </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>Tangana was also there.  After we had our meal, Chairperson, there was chaos.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>wanted, everybody wanted to go to the loo after we had this meal.  Because we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>more than 15, because Comrades were more than 15 in the cell they would go to one </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>loo.  Fortunately, I was alone in the cell.  I became ill and they decided to take me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>hospital.  In hospital my family members were not allowed, because I was a detainee, </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>but the workers would come to visit me in hospital and they would want information </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>of whether there are any leaders who died there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a> Chairperson, as the Committee of Ten we were disturbed, because people </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>were being shot outside and some of them disappeared.  Today, on behalf of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>Committee of Ten, when I am concluding the bus boycott issue, I would like to say the </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>victims family members of the bus boycott massacre would not be satisfied, </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>Chairperson, unless someone would come forward to tell us what happened, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>if you are a leader and such incidents are happening, you are also affected.  The people </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>who were against our organisation said that we were the ones who made people killed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a> When I am concluding the bus boycott issue I would like to ask the Committee to </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>persuade the perpetrators to come forward to tell the truth so that the victims and their </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>family members can be satisfied.  They must come here and apologise and I would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>the Commission to speak to the President so that we can have projects in our area and </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>people can get pension grants.  It is difficult for the victims, those who were injured to </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>get the grant.  If the Commission can help them so that they get the pension grant.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>The Commission can come to us and ask the names of these people.  We do have </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>records although they were burnt down when SAWO offices were burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a> Chairperson, I would also like to talk about the struggle of school children </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>especially what happened in Mdantsane in 1986.  We were different structures and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>were trying to discuss this.  Women organisations were there.  We had women's </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>organisations which were strong in East London.  We also had an, DUWEL </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>organisation and ELWA, East London Womens Association and Democratic Union of </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>Women of East London.  These two organisations would be present when </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>negotiations took place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a> In 1986 we were harassed as women.  In all the mentioned occasions women </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>were the ones who were harassed the most.  In the case, in the incident of bus boycott, </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>in 1983 I was in hospital.  I was assaulted in the police station in NU1.  In 1984 I went </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>back to hospital for six weeks, because I was also assaulted.  I think I was assaulted, </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>because I had connections with the ANC and it was banned at that time.  Members of </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>the Committee of Ten were harassed by the people, because people said that these </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>members sold me out.  I use to go to Lesotho.  We did not want the bus boycott to </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>have anything to do with the ANC.  I denied everything and I denied the evidence by </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a> They then assaulted me.  I urinated myself and my ears were burning.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>put a tube.  This was used by the Security Branch when a person would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>interrogated.  They would tie this tube in your neck so that you could not breathe.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>They would say to you if you want us to put, to take off this tube, you will tell us the </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>truth and tie, the tube was tied in your neck.  The police would say that if you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ready to tell us the truth, raise your hand.  After five minutes I would raise my hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>and say, yes, I am going to tell you the truth and they would take off this tube.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>would say, yes, I am going to tell you the truth.  I do go to Lesotho and I come back.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>What else do you want?  I am not going to, I do not want to talk more about that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a> At that time I was a leader, but I would like to tell you what the police use to </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>do to us.  I was imprisoned with my friend Mtze, it was four of us in totality.  We were </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>woken up early in the morning by the prisoners to be interrogated at unit one, </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>Mdantsane.  The interrogation was led by White men.  The team was led by Charles </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>van Wyk.  There was a whole lot of them.  So therefore the team that was torturing us </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>and the team that was interrogating us was different.  They therefore had particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>specific job to beat people up, to torture people.  This is the Black people, our own </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>people that were torturing us.  When I had urinated on myself, all wet, I woke up from </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>that, my tracksuit was wet as well.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a> They sent in my friend, Mtze, so that I could see how much he had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>beaten up.  He said to us if you continue not to divulge the truth you are going to die </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>here.  He said to me that Mtze was beaten up, because I was not divulging anything.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>saw that they would say that they would beat us up until we mess on ourselves.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>friend had messed on himself, I noticed.  I said to him that perhaps we should tell them </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>everything, but we decided not to.  We said to them that they must beat us up to </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>death, it is alright.  He said the same thing.  I would hear him screaming, crying from </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>next door and he would hear me as well.  These were huge, hefty men that were </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>beating us up, you must realise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a> Mr Chairperson, Madam Chair, the most important thing I want to say about </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>women's struggle for liberation.  Nhononho ...  </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me, because we did not get a statement we did not know </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>that you would mention peoples' names.  It is my job to warn you that this is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>according to our procedures.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MS MAXONGO:  Reverend, people were beaten up.  It was painful.  Women cried </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>out, they screamed, but there was no mercy.  You would think that when a woman </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>cries out, praying, mercy would be found.  We prayed, but got no mercy.  I was also </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>beaten up Mr Chairperson.  I was beaten up such that I had a terrible wound on my </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>head that I was temporarily blind.  The women stood strong.  The car I was driving </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>was packed with women.  When we were next to Elwoody with women bleeding, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>traffic cop stopped my car.  The traffic cops stopped our car.  They said that I did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>have a licence.  I told them I had a learner's licence.  They said that I could not do that. </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a> I told them that we were bleeding, injured.  They refused.  We got out as women, </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>pushed them out of the way and got back to the car and we told them that they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>get us at the hospital.  As women we were very oppressed.  Our rights were violated, </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>but we got to the hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a> Mr Chairperson, I said that I was not going to be long.  I just wanted to reveal </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>that as women we contributed to the struggle.  I want to request the Committee, </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>however, that, well it is going to take a report before the President, especially in </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>connection with the bus boycott victims, something should be done for the people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>People's families, children belonging to the victims.  There should be some form of </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>fund to educate, to pay for their education.  We would appreciate that peoples' bodies </p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>be exhumed and people be given their full rights to bury their own people that </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>disappeared.  Children that were injured, most of them were not able to continue with </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>their education.  These are the battles of COSAS.  They should be, people should </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>endeavour to help these people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a> I went to the Border Training Centre and found out that if the Government </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>would help certain organisations and women so that people could be trained.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>are knitting machines, sewing machines and there are other ways to help people </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>especially with their skills so that people can forgive and people can let go of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>bitterness they feel towards Sebe's regime.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Priscilla.  We know that you could continue the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MS MAXONGO:  It is exactly so Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  You speak as a woman who did not read about the womens </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>struggle in the newspapers, but who lived it.  You were in an out of detention cells </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>quite a number of times during the struggle for liberation.  Your requests before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>Commission that womens' projects be looked at closely and also thanking, in a way, a </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>token thanking them for their contribution to the struggle.  Thank you Priscilla.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>need a copy of your statement so that we have it in our record, because I do not think </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>you read everything that you wrote.  Thank you.  You may step down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MS MAXONGO:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
