We would like you to co-operate with us to try and save time, but do not feel as if you have to, you do not have to tell your whole story.  This is an important day, because Thursday is Womens' Day.

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Are you going to swear her in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Welcome Mantombi.  Please stand up so that we can help you take an oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MANTOMBI MARIA BEN:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  I will now hand over to Mrs June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  Good morning Mrs Ben.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Ben, you are here today to talk about your mother, Lena Rasmeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Before you start I would like to just clarify one point that is incorrect, I think in the statement that  have in front of me.  Did this incident that you are going to talk about happen in Port Elizabeth or in Cradock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> In Cradock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you, yes, that is what I thought.  The incident you are going to talk about is one of the most horrific incidents that happened to women and it could not have been easy for you as a daughter to know that this happened to your mother.  I believe that your mother is now deceased.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> In what year did she die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> In 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And the incident that we are going to talk about, of the rape that she experienced, was on the third of August 1985.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I am going to hand over to you now to tel us the story of what happened regarding that incident.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> I was not present when this incident happened.  I was in the farm.  It happened on a Saturday.  I came home on a Monday.  When I arrived home I was told about what happened.  My mother was sleeping at home, she was sick.  I asked what happened.  She told me. She said that it was at night on Saturday, she was at home.  She heard people outside.  When she was going to see what was happening she met the police.  The police took her, forced her into a hippo and they took her to the bushes in Mission.  Two police were left with her.  The two policemen raped her and then they left her in that area.  She woke up and she went to a coloured township, to Bongweni to my uncle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a> When she got to my uncle, my uncle took her to the doctor.  On the following day he then took her to the police to report this matter.  The police asked whether she knew the people who did this to her.  She said no.  The police then said that there is nothing to be done if she did not know who these people were.  What happened when I got there is that I went to the Street Committee to ask for advice.  They then asked me to tell them the story.  After that Mr Goniwe, who was a Comrade, called ANC lawyers.  The lawyers got there and they took my mother with.  They then returned her back home saying that they will come again to pick her up.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> The came and picked her up.  When she came back on this last occasion they said that they found the White men who did this to my mother.  After a month, I think two months, we received a letter saying that the White men who did this were found and they have been fined.  They have been fined R7 500,00 each.  I took this letter to these people, those who were handling this case.  They told me that the lawyers passed away so nothing will continue after that.  That is all my story.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now, you are saying that the people who raped your mother were police.  Were they police or SADF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> They were soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> They were soldiers.  You are also saying that you did not appear in the court or your mother did not appear in the court at all.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Do you know whether she received any medical treatment after the rape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, she did receive medical treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Where did she receive that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> In Cradock in the clinic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> How did the rape effect your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> This rape injured my mother, because after that she suffered from epileptic fits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> How do you, Mrs Ben, feel about the fact that people who had raped your mother, who at that time was a 65 year old woman, was simply fined R7 500,00 and allowed to go back, presumably, into the army again?  What does that make you feel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> This is a pain to me, because my mother died afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> If these people were to seek amnesty for the deed that they did, how would that make you feel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> I do not know, because up until today I am not satisfied about what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Ben, are there any other children, did your mother have other children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Will you tell me how, if there are any that are still dependent that you are looking after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, two of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Their ages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> One is 36 years old and the other one is 21 years old.  One is 36 and the other one is 24.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Ben, in coming here today what were your expectations from the Commission?  What were you hoping that the Commission would do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> I would like the Commission to help me with a tombstone for her grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> For your mother's grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, my mother's grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is that all that you wish to ask of the Commission at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> Yes, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is there anything further that you feel you would like to say that you might have forgotten at this point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BEN:</span> No, that is all I had to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mrs Ben, we thank you for bringing this painful story to our attention.  In this day and age when rape is such a common thing, it is still shocking to hear that two young White men should rape an elderly woman such as your mother.  We extend our sympathy to you for an event that happened many years ago, but that has affected your life even up to now.  Thank you for your courage in coming forward to tell us about this.  We will, as the Commission, take note of what you have asked for about the tombstone and submit that recommendation to the President.  Thank you very much.  You may leave the stand.  Thank you, just, no, before you go, it might be that my colleagues would want to ask you questions.  So I am going to hand you back to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mrs Crichton.  We thank you Mantombi.  We have no further questions.</p>
