            "Afternoon Mr Shiyani. The story that you're going to give an account of is that on the 25th of December 1988, you were with your friends and you were enjoying yourself.  At the time you were assaulted, there were bullets over and rifles all over. Let's start from the beginning, and try to talk about yourself.  You as a victim would like to know who is here, who is Mr Billy Shiyani.  Probably if you can start there, we'll be able to have an estimate and imagine what caused this assault. Thank you please give a brief outline.\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 B.SHIYANI",

            "The Vice Chair and all who are here for the Truth Commission, I'd like to greet you.  My name is Billy Shiyani and my second name is Vuyisela.   I was born in East London in the location which is called Tsolo. The place was also called Duncan. When we moved from Duncan to go to Ezpumzni Location, which was a Duncan extension.  I attend school at St Phillips, that was my primary education, I went on to attend school at Duncan Village Higher, like any child there in East London I went to Welsh. My mother died when I was in standard 3, and my father died when I was in standard 7 at Welsh High School.  My parents were poor.  When I finished studying at Welsh, I went to Pedi.\n I came back to East London again, as the bread winner.  Both for my family and also my nieces and nephews.  We were a very religious family and in 1970 I went with my aunt Mrs Sinjlani to stay at Mtansani. I was exchanging these families, my paternal aunt which was Mrs Ncumbuti.  There was a mayor at the time at Mtansani location, he was Mr Gordon Nqumsa, he's dead now.  There are many units there at Mtansani, Unit 1 and 2 were macadamised and the other roads were untarred in the other units. The people started complaining about this, especially those who were in new units, from Unit 3 upwards.  There was a meeting and Mr Nqumsa was taking the problems and complaints from the people.  I was one of the people who went there together with my friends and we attended this meeting. We requested Mr Nqumsa and mandated him to come here in East London  to the municipality to come and present our case.  \n When he came back he gave us a report back and he said the white man is adamant, they feel that they will never macadamise those roads.  He said he will go for the last \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 B.SHIYANI\ntime, but if they refuse to do it, he will resign. This\n meeting was in another area in an open space called Highway.  When his efforts failed he resigned as mayor because, at the time, the white person didn't want to do anything to lift the standard of the blacks.\n In 1973, there was a bus boycott, and this was called because of the problem of the increase in the bus fares.  I was with my colleagues while travelling back to my place, we boarded a taxi, and when we were there, there was a child who was being chased.  We couldn't board the taxi as we felt that we must protect this person, it may happen that she might be one of our relatives and we resolved to make an effort to assist the child.  This girl ran and we followed her, but we realised that she was being chased by the vigilantes and the councillors of that time.\n When we went back to our cars, we were surrounded by some men. If you cab remember well, the homeland was very suppressive and oppressive.  What used to happen, they would enlist the help of the businessmen and the people who were from the rural areas, and they would have...(indistinct) and then would assault everybody who refused to board the busses.  We decided that we wont run away from this and decided to walk peacefully.  They started to ask us where we were going to.  Without responding to them, we were assaulted, but I stood my ground and decided that I wont run and was severely beaten.  I realised among the people who were assaulting us was Mr Nan.  My front teeth were broken during that day.\n I went to a garage next door and vowed that I would not let these men get away with what they'd done, I'd lodge a complaint against them.  I went to do so and there \nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n4 B.SHIYANI\nfortunately were policemen whom I knew at the police station.  They were Ndusquabawe and  Mulandeliwe, and they promised to make an arrest.  True to their words they arrested Mr Nan and there was a court case.  There were  many people who also went to report these assaults done by the business people and the vigilantes.  I remember one lady who was highly expectant, and she was assaulted terribly by the vigilantes.  The person who was handling the case ...(intervention)",

Then we heard that Mr Masisa will stop working for the government.  He would not even be taking articles as an attorney. Now a white person handled my case.  You know what happened in this case, I was not even informed about the dates for the court cases.  Denthonga helped me a lot.  He's an advocate today.  Ben was doing articles at that time at Mr Makabi's and Mr Makabi represented the vigilantes who assaulted the people.\n The information which he would give me was very helpful, he would tell me, go to this place on this date, it's your case.

Well\nEAST LONDON  HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 B.SHIYANI\nthey went through the kitchen door which is opposite a room, my girlfriend Nori, wanted to go and went on to say that she was also going because she understood very well that it was the 24th, Christmas Eve.  So she thought we were really going for entertainment, and my sister said, \"No don't let her go\",  because I had told my sister that I was going somewhere else.

Well all of us went out to get into the car.  I said to Joe Jongolo, \"Can you please wait for us at Jeff's place?\"  Now he was already gone 30 minutes before time to wait for us there together with Virginia.
