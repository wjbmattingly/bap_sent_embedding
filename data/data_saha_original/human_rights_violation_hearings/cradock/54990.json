This girl left and I went out of the house.  \n Mzwandile came into the house.  I didn't ask him about what was happening because I couldn't see people fighting but I could just hear that this girl was saying, I am going to ask him, I am going to ask him.\n When I went back to the house and I looked outside, I could see this girl coming with two Kits Constables with guns and they were also carrying walkie talkies.  \n When they were in front of the house, there is an electric pole in front of my house, one of the Kits Constables said just go back - he said to this girl.    This girl went back and then the police came to my house.\n They went passed me in front of the house, they went into the house.  Mzwandile was standing inside the house, half naked.  They asked who was Mzwandile?  Mzwandile said I am Mzwandile.  They said come.  Mzwandile responded by asking them where should I go?\n They assaulted him.  They put him out of the house and he was still asking them what was wrong.  I started crying while they were at the door and there were a lot of people in front of the door, they were also crying.\n They pulled him until he fell.  I could hear a noise of the gun and this other Kits Constable was shooting him.  While I was still crying, the blood was all over the place.  One old man said, this boy is dead.

By telling us this story which is so painful, there is something that I have noticed in these stories, the stories that we have been listening to yesterday and today, which is a problem in my mind, that all these stories were supposed to be under the lawyers who were fighting for the Human Rights, they should have made a follow up, but we realise that a lot of them didn't take note, they didn't make a follow up.\n In stead a murder case would just end like anything.  Whereas the lawyers who claim to be the lawyers of Human Rights, were among us.  Maybe there is a specific reason\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n7 ND BILL\nwhich can clarify, but on my mind I become confused why did all these matters that involve the death of the people, not go on and have the real outcome, no follow up, nothing.\n Perhaps we are going to ask that question when we are dealing with the hearing of the people who were maintaining law and order, but for now, we are going to say thank you to you and we have taken note of your request that you have made to the Commission and we will also see to it that our investigators will make a follow up.
