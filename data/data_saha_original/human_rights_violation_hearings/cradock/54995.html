<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> I am making a mistake it was February, February 1994, because I was shot in 1993.</p>

<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> I was a plumber.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> After you had been shot, did you continue doing your job working as a plumber?</p>

<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> When you were given pension, was it because you couldn't work properly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> It is because of the stroke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all that you would like to tell us today, Mr Dilima?</p>

<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> I went there and reported the case and he stopped me when I went there for the second time.  He said he was going to write me a letter.  I received a letter saying that I must come to him quickly, but when I went there, they said he was not there.  Maybe he was in Beaufort-West or Adelaide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a> They said they would phone me later.  I left the telephone number of the Nclapa family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Are the pellets behind your eyes still there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> Just underneath my left eye.  I was short sighted for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DILIMA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you Mr Dilima, you have given us a clear picture of your shooting while you were just walking, you had nothing to do with what was happening on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a> You were affected for the rest of your life because of that incident.  Thank you for coming forward to tell your story.  As you have requested, we are going to try to talk to the President and tell him about your requests that your health should be taken care of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a> We can see right now that it is very difficult for you to walk.  If there is something that we would like to get from you, we will come to you, maybe if we need some Doctor's Certificate, but for now, thank you.</p>
