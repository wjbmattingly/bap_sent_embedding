<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MZWANDILE JOSEPH DYWILI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What is your clan name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Mhlatu Jambas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you.  We have a statement before us that you have given us that you got injured and also Henry Qatana.  Could you tell us what was happening that day.  The atmosphere at the township as well so that we have a picture of what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> It was on the 29th of November 1986, we had a party in a room. One of my friends got out just to walk around the yard.  A moment after that we heard a policeman walking around.  Siphithiphithi then walked out of the house also to go and see what was happening.  After we'd walked out we heard a gunshot.  When Henry Qatana also went out to see what was happening we discovered that Siphithiphithi had already been shot and had actually already passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a> When Henry Qatana tried to lift him up to bring him inside we heard a voice asking where we are taking him and ordered us to leave him, whereupon someone shot Henry in the head.  I also got out to see what was happening and as I was walking towards the kitchen I got shot in the hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> The ambulance then arrived together with police and took us to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> We were being shot at by special constables. At the hospital there was a policeman guarding us.  We then sent a report that we don't want him there because we have not done anything. He then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> I was discharged after two weeks and the police came to fetch me and sent me to jail.  The third week, after Henry had been discharged, he also was ten to jail. Five of our friends were there already because we were toytoying in the street.  We were in detention for three months before we got released but we had to go and sign the charge office, twice a day, in the morning and in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Excuse me is Mike Kob a lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes he was our attorney who helped us out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So you say there are some of those Kitskonstabels that you know by name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Vuyani shot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Vuyani Tyali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> And the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Bhabhatane, Noppeise and Ncamile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are those people still around in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes they are.  Vuyani however died in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was there a court case because Vuyani had shot people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> We were acquited then they told us that he was going to be sentenced in Grahamstown.  They just left him to go wherever he wanted to until he ended up in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> He was not sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> No he was not sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Do you get any compensation from the Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> We put in a claim but they did not respond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Which attorney did you use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Magqabi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So therefore if we investigate, we can contact them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So therefore you're not working any longer because you're ill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes the pellets were never removed from my hand and when I work they bother me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have children and a wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How many children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are they at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What do you think the Commission can do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Can the Commission help me support my children and educate them please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are you getting any form of disability grant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> NO I don't get anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there something else perhaps that you would like us to look at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> If the Commission could please help us with the claim that we put with the attorneys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were you a member of any political organisation that the police were so much against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Yes the UDF.  We were all together with Vuyani and them but then they took the job as constables. It was clear then that even then when we were just sitting and having fun it seemed as if we were planning something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What were you in the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> I was just a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I will hand you over to Mr Chairperson now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you very much Joseph Dywili, your story was very clear.  We have noted down your requests and are going to hand them over to our President.  That is what we do with requests of all victims who have either been injured, tortured or whose loved ones have passed away.  It is up to the President what to do with the requests.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DYWILI:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
