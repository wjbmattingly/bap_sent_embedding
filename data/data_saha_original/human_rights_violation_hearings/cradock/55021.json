Your son died in battle, even though it would seem that your son was shot by someone who is not a policeman, but it is clear that he used to work together with the regime.\n Perhaps it should be comforting to you that even though your son cannot come back to you, that what he fought for, what he stood for, what he gave up his life for, we now have it. You should count him as one of the heros who gave up his life for the country.\n We have noted the requests that you have stated before us and we will hand them over to our President so that he can see what he can do.  We thank you, won't you please take your places?",
