<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is there any reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> No, but we were confused at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have any other thing you want to say about Andile and this incident?</p>

<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> It was Ngalo, it was Ngalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> The night vigils that you had, there must have been many of them at that time, was there a lot of harassment by the police at those vigils?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> Yes, they were harassing people because when they attended night vigils, police used to harass and assault them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did they try to disrupt the proceedings and get people away from the vigil?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> Yes, they used to go to the night vigils and disrupt everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> There was clearly no respect for people who had died?  My second question to you is, did you receive a Death Certificate at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> Yes, I received a Death Certificate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> What did it state as the cause of death?</p>

<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>5 E NJOBO</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>investigating and they will contact me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mr Njobo, you said that Ngalo was the soldier of Umkhonto We Sizwe.  Do you remember his first name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> Yes, I do.  I think it was Maganda, but I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> According to your knowledge, your son was he the only one that was killed that night, or who was injured that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> There is another one who was stabbed the same night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Was he from the night vigil?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> I am not sure, but he was also stabbed that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> At the time of your son's death, was he involved in the organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NJOBO:</span> He was a member of CRADORA at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you Mr Eric Njobo.  We remember these sad days.  The days that the Umkhonto We Sizwe members were killed.  We also remember that the people who were in power at that time, refused permission for others to go to these kinds of funerals and people were afraid, even ministers were afraid to attend such funerals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a> They were afraid to go to give support to the families and the families were supposed to bury these people alone.  We think that as you have presented your testimony, your son went to the night vigil to try and comfort the families of the soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a> We will come back to you and to the guy you have mentioned, Monde, who was present when these things happened.  Our investigating team will come back to you to get those details so that we can have some more information from you and from Monde.  Thank you.</p>
