<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We got a report that Theo Simon Solomon will not be here because he's in jail at the moment, we don't know if it still is, so we have not yet received a latest report.   I think that the people from Graaf Reinet will be with us by then, maybe we should continue in the meantime as they are not here.  We usually take a moment of silence to remember those of us who passed away, also for those who disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a> Before we start our proceedings, I wonder if we could get up please and take a moment of silence and remember those who left us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a> We remember Xolani Reginald Ncaca, Nomanezo January, Xola Owen Nomavuka, Siphithiphiti Welcome Qatana, Ntsikelelo Richard Dali, Frank Mthembu, Basil Xalisa, George Oupa Gilbert, Sophie Nunusi Maarman, Desmond Baatjies, Sandile Latone Ntswayi.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> May they rest in peace Lord and give them light everlasting!</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a> We will now start with the three witnesses from Cradock, they have similar cases, they will go up on the stand together, Nopopi Gertrude Ncaca, Nompumelelo January and Angelina Rampo Nomavuka.  We request that they come up together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson I'll swear them in, I'll start with Nopopi Gertrude Ncaca.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">NOPOPI GETRUDE NCACA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson they've been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are going to request that Ntsiki Sandi lead the witnesses in evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you very much Mr Chairperson.  Good morning to you this morning!  We are going to start with Nopopi Getrude Ncaca.  Mrs Ncaca, when we look at your statements, we notice that you all talk about the same incident.  Your children were killed, shot in Cradock at Skhulu Street on three of your statements.  You are talking about the same policeman, Sergeant Hoyiya.  Mrs Ncaca, I want to ask was your son killed in 1986 and not 1985, because the other two ladies are talking about 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are you sure it's 1986 and not 1985?  We will sort it out.  You say that on that day Xolani Reginald Ncaca, you said that he's your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes he was my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you tell us what happened on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> I don't have a full report because I was at work. I was taken from work by my neighbours.  When I got home there were a whole lot of people and I was told that Xolani had been shot.  He was shot at Sekulu Street by Hoyiya. I have no full report, when he was shot he got shot in the head, the back of his head was in tatters. I have no full report about Xolani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were they going to fetch a corpse that was also a victim of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The people who came to fetch you from work, what exactly did they say happened before Hoyiya shot these children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> They didn't tell me what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did Xolani die immediately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was there a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> At the time no one cared about us at the charge office.  You'd go there to give a report and a statement, they would swear at us and say, "Voetsek you kaffirs, what do you want here?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You therefore never went to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> No we did not go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did this case go to the court of law in any way, an inquest perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> It just ended like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You did not have any attorney to help you with the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> No we did not look for an attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How old was Xolani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> He was 16.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was he a school child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What standard was he doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> He was in standard four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did Xolani partake in student activities in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes quite a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Therefore his life was in danger as a result?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you come across any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> I don't remember Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say about the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did this incident affect your health at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> My memory was affected, if you tell me something I just forget. I always forget.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Won't you please come closer so that we can hear you. Did you get any form of treatment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have any requests of the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> I need a tombstone or perhaps some kind of compensation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say Mrs Ncaca before I go on?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Ncaca, do you know the other ladies next to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes I know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hear about the incidents of their children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NCACA:</span> Yes I heard about Nomavuka's child but it is the first that I see this lady next to me</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The incident on which Mrs Nomavuka's going to talk about, did it happen the same day.</p>
