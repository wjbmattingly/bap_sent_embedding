            "At the end of 1984 we were having a celebration as comrades, we were singing and walking through the townships and when we were in the village of Holland, at about eight o'clock, there were six policemen who were standing there.\n Amongst these police there was a young man by the name of Vuyani Jonasi.  They stopped us and they told us to \nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 DV MNGONA\ndisperse.  We did so.  He was pointing at us with a gun.  We quarrelled with him verbally and he shot at us and we dispersed.\n I was forced to go home.  My grandmother asked me where my brother was.  In the morning I went to the police station.  I approached Lieutenant Gerber, I asked him if he knew anything about my brother.  He told me to go to the back of the police station, there was something there.\n I must open up and check it that was my brother.  When I opened this place, I could see that it was my brother.  His body was so torn, he was riddled with bullets.  I can't tell, there were about seven bullet holes in his body.\n I went back home to tell them the news.  I was told to go back to the hospital after two hours because he was going there for a post-mortem.  I went there and I arrived just after the post-mortem.  \n I took him with a bakkie to the mortuary.  We started planning for the funeral.  We buried him.  I was working for the GG, General Government in Jansenville.  I made preparations, arrangements for the funeral.\n After the funeral, the police came to me to ask about the manner in which he was buried.  I was arrested under the State of Emergency for three months.  The comrades from different places decided that we must enquire about the date of our release.\n We were not given the date.  We decided that we were not going to allow them to arrest us without telling us the date of the release and we were harassed, we were assaulted.\n I fell and I was beaten up with a baton on my left hand eye, I was taken to Livingstone Hospital.   I slept there for three months.\nCRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 DV MNGONA\n My eye was operated, after that my eye became completely blind.  I was undergoing treatment, I went there three times.  They used to inject me in my eye, I decided not to go there again.  When I went back to work I was told that there is no work for me.\n I tried looking for a job in Jansen Village, because my grandmother was looking after us with her pension money.  I have been looking all over for a job.  Fortunately for me in 1997 on the 2nd of January I got employed by the Municipal Council, that is the end.",
