So that was a great privilege  for me to have been with them at university.  When I left there I entered the teaching profession and I became a member of the Teachers' League of South Africa the Unity Movement.  I also had friends in the Communist Party, I taught with them but I never became member of the Communist Party.  In any event I was associated with those who opposed the government at the time and the apartheid system and I was being harassed and intimidated to a considerable extent during my early years as a school teacher until 1976 when I was detained for the first time.  I don't know whether you want me to continue further in this trend Comrade Chair.",

I considered that as a form of intimidation in order to be able to pin something on to me.  It went on until they arrested me in June 1976, I was busy in my office and without any warning the security police entered my office and told me that I'm being put under arrest.  They did not convey any reasons for my arrest and just told me that I had to come along with them.\n They took me to the police station at Graaf Reinet without allowing me to see my wife or to enter my home in order to pick up small toiletry requirements, etc. and I was rushed from there, from the police station at Graaf Reinet at break-neck speed by a security policeman, Sergeant van Eden, to Oudtshoorn.  From there I was immediately transferred to another police vehicle and taken to Paarl, and there I was imprisoned in the Victor Verster Prison.",

I still had very important matters to attend to but the security police were not interested in that at all, and that is why I felt very frustrated, very demoralised, and it was an experience of extreme distress for me during my detention.  I remained in prison for seven months, it extended over the Christmas vacation, New Year, they would not release me, the security police at Oudtshoorn, under whose jurisdiction Graaf Reinet fell at the time.  They maintained that I was a source of danger to the community, I had to be taken completely away from the community and it was only the intervention of the security police of Cape Town who visited the Victor Verster Prison regularly and I maintain it was because of good conduct that they declared that I had to be released in the new year.",

So that is the position as far as 1976 was concerned.  I returned and decided that I was going to resign, take early retirement from the teaching profession because I feared that at some stage they were going to dismiss me, the Department of Education, because of my opposition to the Coloured Affairs having taken over the education of our schools at the time, I was vehemently opposed to Coloured Affairs and I expressed myself freely in the presence of inspectors when they visited my school and I think that is a factor which would have eventually led to my dismissal, and that is why I decided to go on early retirement prematurely, depriving myself of substantial financial benefits, pension benefits and other benefits.  But I felt that the safest way out would be for me to go on premature retirement, even though I suffered financially because of that premature retirement in 1976.  I retired in 1978, I served another year, 1977 and in 1978 my retirement was granted, voluntary retirement prematurely.",

We slept amongst one another and it was a horrible experience.  I told this Sergeant Stander, when he came into the cell that it was a disgraceful state to which we were being subjected and were they not going to see to it that we were at least allowed human facilities.
