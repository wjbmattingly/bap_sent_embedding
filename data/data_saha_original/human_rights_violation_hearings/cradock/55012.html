<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Could you tell us more about Buyisile Ndoni before he passed away in prison?</p>

<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>2 LR NDONI</p>

<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Before he was arrested, was he a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Are there other things that he participated in at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Well, I would not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was he politically orientated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So you say that police came at home and he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What kind of police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who was at home when the police arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> It was us and the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What do you mean us, do you mean you and the father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, the father was not there, he was at work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So it was you and the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What reasons did they give for arresting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> They did not give any reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did they say where they were taking him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So then he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you take any steps at home as parents whose children had been arrested?  So your child was arrested by the police, so what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> We were all at home.  I just started crying, I</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>3 LR NDONI</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>didn't say anything, I didn't do anything.  He was then sentenced.  There was a court case before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a> After he was sentenced he was imprisoned at St Albans.  On a Thursday at about nine o'clock in the morning I saw a police van.   They asked if Buyisile Ndoni is my child, I said yes.  They said that they have then come to inform me that he had passed away.  That was the last I heard until I woke up at a Doctor's surgery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> When Buyisile was imprisoned, accused and sentenced for public violence, were there others who were accused with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, there were a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> There are two names that you have mentioned in your statement.  Do you remember who they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Can you tell us please?  You said it was Mzwabantu Molose and Gerald Ndinge, where are they now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Mzwabantu has passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did he also die in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So Constable Koos came to inform you that your son had been stabbed in jail?  Did you know Constable Koos previously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, we know him.  He is a policeman from Pearston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What reasons did he give for your son having been stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> He didn't give any reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did he say who stabbed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No.  He just gave me that message and he left.  I then fainted and I was taken to a Doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>4 LR NDONI</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did he tell you how much time had elapsed between the time your son was stabbed and the time he gave you the report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> I did not ask him, because I could not say a word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who is Zimasile Gooi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> It was the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> In which way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Zimasile was also in jail with him.  Zimasile apparently said that if anything happens to my son, then the police would have to repay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Therefor they were all together in jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So what did Zimasile say, what report does he give.  What happened in jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> When my son died, Zimasile was no longer in the same jail.  They wanted to separate the two.   They wanted Buyisile to be in solitary confinement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a> They wanted to take my son and put him amongst criminals who had been in jail for quite a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is Zimasile here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, he is in Cape Town, he works there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was there a post-mortem after your son passed away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, there was no post-mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was anybody accused for his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So to this day you do not know who stabbed your son in jail or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, I don't know to this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Before Buyisile was jailed, did he gave problems with the police, were they after him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>5 LR NDONI</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, there were no such problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> As someone who was a member of banned organisations, was he not under police surveillance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> He was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were there specific incidents that made it clear that the police were looking for him or wanting him in any way?  Do you reconcile the two incidents within you, or do you perhaps think it is the police that stabbed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Well, I can't say whether it is the police or the convicts that stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you get a Death Certificate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, I did not get one.  The people who went to fetch the corpse, must have received the Death Certificate, but I don't know what they did with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did anyone who received the Certificate ever tell you what was written on the Death Certificate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> They said that they didn't see anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Where was he buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> He was buried in Pearston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was it a peaceful funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, it was a peaceful funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did the police limit you in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, they just said that we must bury him on a Friday and we must not go to work on Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a> So we buried him on the Friday in stead of the Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Which day would you have chosen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> We would have chosen the Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is that not a limitation that you wanted to bury your son on Saturday in stead of Friday?  Are there any orders that you were given by the police?</p>

<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did they stipulate the number of people that should attend the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did they stipulate and delegate who should speak at the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> No, they didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who spoke at the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Are you asking about members of the organisation?  There were no members of the organisation that spoke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who spoke at the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> There were no speakers from the organisation, no there were none.</p>

<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> Yes, there were but they were unable to get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Therefor you say there were members of the organisation who wanted to come and talk, but they did not get there.  Where were they from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDONI:</span> They were from Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a> We tried to get transport.  On the Saturday we were supposed to go to East London but Rossouw came to tell us that my son had passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How long had he been in prison when he died?</p>

<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOLOSE:</span> Yes, they were all together, all in the same cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there an inquest or did you try and investigate what had happened in the cells?</p>

<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a> I would like to ask both of you if you could say to me what you think actually happened to your sons?  Was there any other indication that you had that there might have been something else that had been done to them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said that the police at Pearston were very cruel?</p>

<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you tell us exactly what they did that reflected this cruelty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOLOSE:</span> They would beat our children up, they would take them through the night and they wouldn't sleep at home because they would be beaten up by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Initially you said there were 15 children, are you talking about children that had been arrested or children that had been shot?</p>

<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> We heard from certain mothers here yesterday and today that before their children had been shot, the police would threaten the children prior to their deaths.  Had your children been threatened at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOLOSE:</span> Yes, they did threaten.  First of all they said that they would give them long sentences, so that there is no repetition of what they did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> And the police, did they say any like thing?  Did they threaten your sons' lives at all?</p>

<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOLOSE:</span> If I am not mistaken, he is still there, because he married a woman from Pearston.</p>
