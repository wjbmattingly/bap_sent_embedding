I think he was there, he was at the funeral himself.\n He has tried to comfort you that you cannot cry for such heroes.  He told us about the history of your family and we could see that your boy was from the hero's family.\n He gave up his life, because if he didn't do that, today he would have been a rich man.  He was fighting for this country.  We salute you today for that although other people wouldn't like us to do that.\n I want to assure you that the perpetrators are coming forward, every day we find revelations and they are telling the people what they have done.  One of the things that the Commission is busy investigating is what was involved in the SADF.\n Your first request was that you wanted to know who were the perpetrators, who gave command.  Maybe some day we will be able to answer that question even without investigating because today they are coming forward and they are telling us what happened.\n Reverend Xundu has already said that as you have requested that his remains should be brought back to this country, we are dealing with that as a Commission but we hope that such people who were buried in countries like Lesotho, their families will come together and decide what they want to do.\n Maybe some people will say that they want their people back, but they have to come together.  Today we would like to say we thank you for coming forward.  We thank you.",
