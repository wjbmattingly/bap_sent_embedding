<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>REVD FINCA: We are going to call upon Frans Blou.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Allow me to swear them in Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">KETANI FRANS BLOU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you sir.  He is sworn in properly Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> June Crichton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Good afternoon Mr Blou.   Good afternoon Mr Blou, can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, I can hear you Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> We would like to welcome you here this afternoon.  I would like before we start, to just get a few things clear about the relationships in the story that you are going to tell us.  So first of all I am going to ask you some questions about who different people are in the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> First of all, is it correct that you are the brother of Ndlamafa Blou?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No, I am not his brother.  I am Ndlamafa Blou's father.  Yes, I am his father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> The next I want to ask you is the relationship of Nanziwe Seline Bobo, what is her relationship to Ndlamafa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Can you please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR CRICHTON:</span> Let me put it a different way?  Is Nanziwe Seline Bobo, was she the sister to the late girlfriend of Ndlamafa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>2 KF BLOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, Ndlamafa Blou had a child with this girl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR CRICHTON:</span> And then the last question on the relationships, that child is she Pumlani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, that is his name, but we are not staying together.  I am not sure about his name, but all I know is that my child had a child with that girl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now the second I would ask that you would do for us please Mr Blou is just to tell us what the political situation in the community was at the time, because you are the first person here from Somerset East to testify.  Can you give us a little bit of an idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> What was happening in the community, what was the harassment like, how was it being done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> What I can tell is about Ndlamafa, though they were not telling me about their business, but I used to hear rumours that he was connected to the ANC organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> When he left Somerset he was a person who said he was looking for a job, therefor he went to Port Elizabeth.  That's the last time I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a> I heard the rumours again saying that he went to Maseru, I am not sure whether that was true or not.  I am not sure whether he left with the people from Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a> I don't even know where he is right now, but I would like to know whether he is dead or not, because he had disappeared - it is a long time now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> You are saying he was involved politically, he was an activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> When he left, I believe his house was raided, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>3 KF BLOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, there was a raid.  There was a rumour that he was a leader of the ANC organisation in Somerset, the political group of Somerset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> In that raid, was there someone there that you know the name of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> In your statement you mentioned Babamaguba, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Can you please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> If you don't know the name, don't worry about that,  let's move on.  When he left, did others go with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> He left alone.  Ndlamafa took a train from Cookhouse to Port Elizabeth, he told me that he was looking for a job.  I never heard anything about Ndlamafa, that was the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> You said he was seen in Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Those were the rumours, I am not sure whether he was really in Maseru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Were there not colleagues of his returning and who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No, no colleagues came to me.  No one came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Apparently he contacted you at one stage and he asked that you get in touch with an attorney.  Who was that attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> I don't know him, because he used to stand up for his own things.  These children, they don't tell us parents about their businesses.  I am not even sure whether he was really going to Port Elizabeth or maybe he was just confusing me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a> Maybe he just wanted to go away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now I have in the statement in front of me</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>4 KF BLOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>the fact that he wanted an attorney and he wanted an attorney by the name of Jingwani and he said so that the attorney could defend him if he had problems with the police.  What kind of problems was he expecting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> I heard that there were documents that were found.  They discovered that he was a leader of that particular group of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> When he didn't come back, did you approach any of the political organisations for help?  Did you hear my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Do you mean me asking for help from the political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> To find (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No this is the very first time that I have decided to take a step because I want to get help so that people should look for him wherever he is.  I want to know something about him, about his whereabouts.  Because there are such a lot of things that are taking place outside, it might happen that he died long ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Blou while he was away and out of the country, he apparently wrote letters to the mother of his child and it seems that these letters were coming from Maseru, did you ever see these letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No.  I don't know anything, I used to ask - the girl used to tell me that they are communicating.  Sometimes he sent money.  But now he later discovered that this girl has a husband now and then he decided not to send her money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr blou, is this child with its mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> He is with the grandmother, because the mother passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now my last question to you - can you tell us</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>5 KF BLOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>what you were expecting the Commission to do for you when you told the story to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> I request that the Commission should help me searching for him because Ndlamafa was my right hand, he was the only person who was helping me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a> I am now getting a pension, I depend on pension.  Ndlamafa was the breadwinner in the house.  That is why I request the Commission to help me.  I want to know if he is still alive or what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Blou, thank you very much indeed for your testimony.  I am going to hand you back to the Chairperson now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mr Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mr Blou, your son - did he have any friends before his disappearance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, they are comrades he used to go with.  But now those comrades I think they are also in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a> I think he used to visit his comrades there in Port Elizabeth, that's why he left Somerset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Before Ndlamafa's disappearance, did his comrades used to come with him or maybe to come visit your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, they used to come visit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> After his disappearance, you didn't see them again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> I never saw them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you hear anything about those comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No.  I never heard anything, but some of them said they left because they were looking for a job in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did the police come after your son's disappearance looking for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>6 KF BLOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, they did come.  They were looking for him, they asked me.  I told them that I don't know him.  They demanded that I should tell them where he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a> I told them that he went to Port Elizabeth looking for a job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did the police come back for this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> Yes, they were looking for Babamaguba, they came twice.  I said I don't know where he is, because he was going to Port Elizabeth when he left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said in your statement that he phoned from Aliwal North?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No, he was writing to the woman, he never wrote to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> This Mr Jingwani that he wanted to make contact with, did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No, I did not know him.   Who is Jingwani, I don't know who you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The attorney that he said he would like you to talk to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> I think that was his secret, I never saw that legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you hear if he ever met this attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLOU:</span> No I didn't hear anything, because when he left he said he was going to Port Elizabeth, he never came back to Somerset.  That was the end.  I am not sure whether he got the job or what happened, he just disappeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Blou.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you sir.  You said something that I am sure that it is true, if some of us can remember that the people who were in the struggle, they did not tell their parents about their business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>CRADOCK HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>7</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a> Just because of that, you must not think that Ndlamafa was not respecting you.  Even when I was young, I used to not tell my parents about my things.  It is not that we didn't trust them, but it is because we didn't want them to know because we knew the pain that they would experience if they would know about our business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a> You will find out that a lot of people didn't tell their parents about their role in the struggle - if Ndlamafa himself didn't tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a> We thank you for telling us your story of which even the name shows that you had big intentions.  We are going to do whatever we can to try and get direction as you have told us that if he is dead, at least his bones should be brought home so that you can cry and be satisfied, just like the other parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a> Thank you sir.</p>
