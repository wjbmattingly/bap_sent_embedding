<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">WILLIAM GILBERT:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Sir you are from Graaf Reinet, Zamiville Location  is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Was your son coming from the Goniwe funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What was going on at that time at Graaf Reinet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> On the 22nd of July 1985 a hippo came to our house, there was a shack at the back of my house, two policemen came to my yard, I was sitting on my veranda and they walked to the children at the backyard.  They went to the closed shack and asked who stayed there and the deceased answered saying that the person who stays there is at work. They wanted to know what was inside and my son then said he refuses to tell them.  They then took a hammer and said that they are not going to argue because P W Botha said that we must not argue with blacks but kill them like flies. I tried to talk to them and they left but they said they were coming back, they swore to come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> After a while they came back at about 12 o'clock. The children ran away and that is when he got shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What was the cause of the disharmony?  Who was leading the township all in all? Were there councillors within the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> There were councillors but the boers at the time just did not want to see a black man. They would just beat you up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are there police that you can identify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes he's still alive, he's working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> They call him Bokkie but his real name is Hills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So he's the one who shot your son?  Was there a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> No there would be no court cases at that time.  They would just say somebody shot and then acquitted him.  I tried to go to an attorney but I was not successful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What attorney was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> An attorney from Port Elizabeth, Patrick Bach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Yes, did you bury him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there something the Commission can do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> You can do me a hugh hugh favour, because that child was going to work for me. He is buried now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So what you want is a tombstone as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there something else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Those boers must be arrested.  You can't just acquit guilty people like that who shot at our children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you get a pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> No I don't have a pension yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> According to your statement you've applied for a pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes I have but I haven't got anything yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did your son have children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> No he was young, he was at school at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I'll hand you over to Mr Chairperson, perhaps he has questions for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> Mr Gilbert, when did you apply for a pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Last year Sir around October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> So you made it in October last year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes but it takes time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> Have you heard about the results?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> So it's Mr Hills who shot your son Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Apparently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> Is he still at Graaf Reinet, is he still a policeman there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> No he's gone to Mossel Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> He was transferred to Mossel Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> He's still a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Apparently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF PANEL:</span> Thank you Mr Gilbert, thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tiny Maya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, Mr Gilbert, how old was your son, you say he was still a student?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> He was about 17 years of age at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was he a member of a political organisation, a youth group perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> I would just hear rumours, it seemed that he was a member of an organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> So you're not sure which organisation it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> No I'm not, I just heard from his friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did he have conflicts with the police prior to that or did they just shoot him because he'd gone to the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> He did not have conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What was the atmosphere like at the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> There was quite a bit of chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is there anyone who got shot or injured prior to your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> Yes there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you again Mr Chairperson. Mr Gilbert I noticed that when you were talking here you said that these perpetrators should be arrested.  Did I understand you well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> I said exactly that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> According to the new law that if perpetrators apply for amnesty, if Mr Hills would apply for amnesty after he had divulged all, how would you feel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR GILBERT:</span> I asked them to leave my house, to leave my children alone even then but he went on and he shot my child.  He did not forgive me then, he had no mercy for me, I have no mercy for him now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr William Gilbert for bring before the Commission the story of your son's death. We have taken note of the requests you brought forward.  Some of them we  may be able to fulfil quickly, for example the pension that you should be receiving. Some of them we will not have to wait to give a report to the President, but will be able to fulfil immediately.  I'd like to clarify that some of your requests will have to be taken to the President.  The particular request that the perpetrators should appear before a court of law is beyond our capability.  We  are very pleased that you spoke openly and told us how you felt so that the perpetrators realise the gravity of their actions.  They should not just take it for granted that they must be forgiven.  They must realise that they are perpetrators, they should humble themselves and wait unto the victims for forgiveness.  Thank you Mr Gilbert.</p>
