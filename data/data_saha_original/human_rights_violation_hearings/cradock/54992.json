She went to do this and after she had gone a few minutes I saw the people toytoying down the road, they went up Queen Street and after a while I heard a big sound.  After that my neighbour Trompie who resides at Mhlala came to me and said that my daughter has been shot by Fiksie. I told Nothembile to go there and I would follow after.  I put on my shoes and followed her.\n When I was at the corner there was a taxi.",
