He died on the 3rd of the same month of the previous year. 1992 and we were waking people up at night.  We kept on waking the people up at night so that we could convene for the memorial service that was going to be held on the 3rd of that month in that year.\n As we were still conducting ...(indistinct) we got to\nThandukukhanya in Richards Bay at Sinobile School, next to the school.  I was leading the group, I was pushing a tyre which was burning and at some stage the fire went off from the tyre, the fire was extinguished and I collected some papers to try and reignite it so that we could see the road all the way ahead.  As I was still collecting the papers and I just arranged them and set them alight my face became visible and that's when they shot me because it was light where I was standing as I was holding the tyre.  \n I fell down at this stage, and when I came to I saw a big light. I don't know where that light came from.  I tried to run away and when I did so I could hear some gun fire behind me,  I escaped to another street where I discovered some other youths whom I told that I had been injured and I was taken to the hospital in a car.",

People in submission that the Human Rights Committee of South Africa is to make to the Truth Commission next week.  It's a very lengthy submission but one of the points that comes out very clearly is that between 1960 and 1990, 15 000 people lost their lives in South Africa in the political conflict.  But between 1990 and 1994, the same number, if not more people were killed.  In many hearings and in different places that we've travelled in the last 15 months we've heard many stories particularly from that 1993-'94 period where people were either shot by cars driving past or people taking shots at them from hidden places, and I have an article here in front of me from the time that you were shot, from the City Press.  It talks about your town as a town of living hell.  And in fact there's a photograph of a younger you, you were still very young as you say.  But people lived in fear at that time and the article intimates that political activists, and you've talked about Mr Shleza as being killed at that time, but clearly there seems to have been a move at that time to kill young political activists and we marvel at you coming here today and being able to tell your story about yourself and about your friends.\n I'm sure people in the community recognise today how far we have got actually from 1990 and '93 to 1997, where yes, clearly we still have problems but at least we live in peace.
