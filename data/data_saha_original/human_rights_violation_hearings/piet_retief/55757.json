            "What happened is that I was at work on that particular night and the children had told me that they would go to Situhle Shleze's(?) memorial or night vigil.  Then the following morning at about 10 in the early morning, mid morning, my friends came to my work place and they told me that my son Sifundo had disappeared. Because they were driving in a car and I tried to find out as to which direction he had followed but they said they didn't know because some were shot during the night and they were at the hospital.  I rushed for the hospital to go and look for my son because they said he had disappeared that night and when I got to the hospital I looked in each and every ward but I couldn't get him, and I was later told that some of the youth had been arrested.  I should go and look at the police station.  I further asked the people who had come to report to me to take me to the police station where I could look for my son and when we got there I was told that there were no youths who had been arrested at that police station except for two bodies that were there at the mortuary.\n I had a desire to go to the mortuary though I had a belief that my son was alive but I also wanted to go to the mortuary to see if I couldn't find my son's body and there are shelves at the police or government mortuary where they pulled out the top shelf drawer when I got there, and when I looked in I could see a female, quite a young female. I shut the drawer because that was not my child but when they pulled out the drawer below that I could identify the corpse as my son. I got very disturbed asking myself how he got to be there at the mortuary.\n At that stage I got very confused.  I was with Themba Khumalo who is quite a well-known person amongst our community together with Mr Mhlulu who is a teacher. They took me outside. I made a request that I wanted to see  what injuries he had sustained because I could see he had an injury on his forehead and I wanted to see the rest of the injuries. Later on I was told that whoever shot at my son shot him from the right-hand side and the bullet went through to the left side. I went back home to tell my family that I had identified my son's body at the mortuary.\n What disturbed me about the whole issue is that when I went to the police station to report the matter, we do not have a police force here because they have not yet changed and are still operating under the old regime. When I went to them to report this matter they told me that I should go and ask Andries Gamede and Josia Thabete as to where my child was. They told me that I should go and report what had happened to the police station but I thank my community for treating me in the manner that they did at that time of confusion and anguish. Sifundo and Numsa Maraso(?) are the children that got killed that day and the community was very helpful in preparing for the funeral.  I thank the Thandukukhanya community for helping me through this very terrible time.\n Quite a length of time elapsed before I could hear from the police as to what had happened and I feel that the police didn't help me in any way to try and find the killers.  But what surprises me today is to hear people in Nelspruit very far from my place asking for amnesty for having killed our children.  I would request this Commission to give these people a chance to come and address this Commission with regard as to how they killed our children because that is what we need to know. What makes me say this is that I do not want to comment on anything that I have read in the newspapers or heard over the radio or any form of media.  But I would appreciate it if the Commission would arrange for these perpetrators to appear before us and the community.  I do not care about who sent him to kill my child but if he can come before me, admit that he killed my son and why he did so, I would like to see that person. Because that is what I would like to know, who shot my child an why. \n I would appreciate it if this Commission would make it possible for me to see this person because I feel that I am an indirect victim of the killing of my son because of the anguish that I have gone through since his death. I want to be able to have an input as to whether he should be granted amnesty or not. That's my request to the Commission because where these children were shot was in the street, on the main road.  If they were attacking anyone's house I would say they were in the wrong and maybe deserve to have been killed, but they were travelling along the main road and I don't understand as to why they were shot on that particular night. So I would like the person to come forward and explain to me as to what took place that night.",

Because what you have been talking to us about is very similar t another case that we have heard today which also took place in 1993 and which involved the same people. And in that case we were told that the action that took place was cold-blooded murder. Now in the amnesty applications people are granted or can be granted amnesty if it is shown that the actions in which they were involved took place within what is called the political context.  So we have on the one side someone describing something as cold blooded murder, which would imply that there is no political connotation, and the other, the same people in an application describing it as an action which took place because of a political motive. Could you perhaps advise us, comment on that distinction an in, certainly in your own case, would you describe it as murder or something within a political context?",

It was just common criminals using the vale of political organisations in order to hide their act or disguise their acts because at the end of the day we discovered that these people had been sent or bought for a sum of money in order to go and kill certain members of the community who were either not wanted by a certain member of another political organisation but it was not a genuine political issue.

We were present and we were attending the case.  They were both convicted.  If I remember very well, I think Keswa was given 25 years. I don't remember about Mdu, but he was given 30-something years.

I, from my discussions at lunch time, clearly there are many people, probably the entire community who was here today, who knows the other person, but you are right, the people who killed were sentenced, have applied for amnesty.  Those people we know already and as to whether they'll come forward in front of you and other people who appeared today, that has to be their conscience.  As people have read in the newspapers, there have been times where these individuals had been granted amnesty or are applying for amnesty, have come forward to the Commission and said, can you please facilitate a meeting with the families involved or the communities involved, and we've done that.  We did that with Brian Mitchell in KwaZulu Natal and more recently, where one of the police officers was implicated in the killing of Goniwe and others. So that is possible to do, but we still don't know whether these individuals have been granted amnesty and we await that decision from the amnesty committee.\n I want to warmly thank you and I know you were not expecting to come here and talk today but by coming you have not only talked about your son but you have also made us hear the story of Nomsa.
