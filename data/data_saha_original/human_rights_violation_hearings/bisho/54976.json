I wish to thank you Chairperson for the very dignified and able manner in which you have Chaired over these two days.  You brought into our hearings your special gifts in terms of patience and tolerance, and we are indeed indebted to you for the smooth way in which these last two days, which were indeed very difficult have been so ably handled.  We record our deep sense of gratitude and appreciation.\n We would like also to thank Dr Ramashala and in absentia Hlengiwe Mkhizi also for their participation and for their contribution to this hearing.  \n Unfortunately if you are going to catch a flight you will have to leave now and we have to take leave of you, not because  - we would have loved to have ended this thing properly with you in the Chair.
