<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> Thank you Reverend Xundu.  Can I just at this stage ask to be excused unfortunately from further proceedings.  The time has caught up with us unfortunately.  Dr Ramashala and myself have to be back in Cape Town by tomorrow and in order to be able to do that we need to leave unfortunately.  As usual it was wonderful to be here.  Quite a pleasure to share the panel with you and to have acted up to this stage as the Chairperson of the proceedings.  I think you very much for that.  It's always a very, very special experience to be in this region.  Thank you for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Chairperson I would like to respond by thanking you for agreeing to Chair this two day hearing.  I</p>

<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>2 N FLEPU</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>particularly requested you to do so because of the difficulty I feel whenever I have to deal with the Bisho Massacre event and how closely I was associated with the developments which were trying to avoid it.  I wish to thank you Chairperson for the very dignified and able manner in which you have Chaired over these two days.  You brought into our hearings your special gifts in terms of patience and tolerance, and we are indeed indebted to you for the smooth way in which these last two days, which were indeed very difficult have been so ably handled.  We record our deep sense of gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> We would like also to thank Dr Ramashala and in absentia Hlengiwe Mkhizi also for their participation and for their contribution to this hearing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> Unfortunately if you are going to catch a flight you will have to leave now and we have to take leave of you, not because  - we would have loved to have ended this thing properly with you in the Chair.  Thank you very much,</p>

<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all you want to say Mr Flepu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR FLEPU:</span> Yes Sir I have a difficulty, I can't even afford to go to a hospital because there is a lot of money required there and my parents do not have this money.</p>

<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>MTHUTHUZELI JAMESON PHUPHANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I am sorry that you have had to wait such a long time.  I believe that you are here today to tell us about how you were at the Bisho stadium, in fact you were approaching the stadium when you were shot in your left upper arm.  The statement states that the bullet went in the front and went out the back, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I'd like you to tell us how it has affected your arm, what is the situation with your arm now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> My arm is not working normally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Do you get any kind of treatment for your arm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> No I don't get treatment except the one I got in Frere Hospital, that was the last time I got treatment.  When I have pain I buy Panados or Disprins and I use them all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is your arm badly enough injured for you not to be able to work anymore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> My arm is very painful and I cannot use it properly and it's affecting me because I cannot work because of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> After the incident did you approach any attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> No I didn't approach any attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I believe you have five children is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> Yes I have five children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And you have asked in your statement that the TRC would recommend that there be assistance given to you</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>6 M PHUPHANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>for the education of these children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> Yes, I requested the TRC to try and assist me with my children and to assist me to get a pension because my wife is supporting me, I cannot work and she is selling to support the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> We have noted that.  Now is there anything else that you wish to tell the Commission about that event, or any statement you wish to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHUPHANI:</span> I would like the Commission to help me to my request I have already put forward if that is possible because there is no one supporting me, it's only my wife's business that is supporting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Phuphani I thank you and I hand you back to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you and we will take the next one.</p>

<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you go to any attorneys because other people approached attorneys to get compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> No I was not aware of that.  I didn't know that people were going to the attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> So in other words you didn't go to any attorneys?</p>

<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mejane please come closer to the mike, I am going to ask you a few questions, I need clarity.  When we spoke earlier on I thought you said that you were in an accident, you were not actually going to the march, you had gone to ask for help at a certain office and then you got injured is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Could you elaborate what happened exactly to you that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> I was going to the office at the magistrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> This was at Hlekse(?).  The officers were closed and then I went to the hiking spot.  There were three queues, people were going to the march at Bisho.  I was told to get onto the taxi because if I would not get on they said that I was an informer.  That is how I got shot.  I don't even know if I was shot actually because it just became hot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you remember these people that forcefully put you on a taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> No I do not remember them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Sir you said we can't even get details from the hospital that actually give proof and confirm that you were injured on that day, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where did you get help as someone who had been injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> I went to a witchdoctor because I was too scared because people were being shot at - people were neglected at the hospital who had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> So up to now you had not been attended to by a</p>

<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>doctor in actual fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> As a person who had been injured to you think that you need help from a doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> No not anymore because I got satisfied with the witchdoctor's treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you use traditional medicine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEJANE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">REV FINCA:</span> Thank you very much to all of you.  You are the last people who are giving us evidence in this hearing of the Bisho Massacre.  We are closing up now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a> Thank you very much for your patience.  I am sure that your patience today and yesterday and the things that you tolerated perhaps if I were in your place I would not have been able to tolerate all these things.  You underwent a lot of pain in these past two days.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a> I would like to say that the Commission has endeavoured after the first hearing at Bisho to liaise with the attorneys that are handling these claims.  We hope that the people who have not been successful with their claims would be helped now that we have liaised with the attorneys.  Those people who did not put forward claims I think that as a Commission we will take that up as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a> I want to say to all of you, and all those who gave evidence here in these past two days, and those who gave evidence in the first hearing at Bisho, even though there is nothing much we can do, because we put forward your requests to the President, even though as a Commission there is nothing much we can do, at the end of the day we would like to say as a Commission that our respect for you and also to say as a Commission that you will always be the brave </p>
