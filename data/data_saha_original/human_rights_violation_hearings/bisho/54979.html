<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>1 D HLEKANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR POTGIETER:</span> We will proceed to Doris Hlekani, and I will ask Ntsiki Sandi to assist her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>DORIS NOMALISA HLEKANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Nomalisa Hlekani do you reside at Tyutyu Village at Bisho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> No not Bisho, but ...(indistinct) King Williamstown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your statement you said you were there when the people were shot at Bisho and today you are going to tell us about what you saw and what happened to you.  I will hand over to you so that you tell the Commission about what happened to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes I am one of the victims who were there.  At the time I was 21 years old.  I was doing standard 10.  We left Victoria grounds for Bisho.  Not far from Bisho just from the tar road to the gravel road I noticed that there was noise by I didn't know what was happening.  I continued.  There was an announcement that we should lie down because there was a shooting.  I couldn't believe at the time but I could hear that something was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said you were shot at while you were moving from the tar road to the gravel road that was going to the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes I was walking on that gravel road, I was far away from the stadium, because my intention was to go to the gates of the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> While you were shot at were there any other people who were shot before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> No I couldn't see anybody.  I only saw myself while I was shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said you fell, and what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>1 D HLEKANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> I couldn't move, I struggled.  Two gentlemen came and took me to the ambulance.  I was taken to the Grey Hospital.  When I arrived there it was already full and we lay down.  The ambulances from Frere Hospital came, I was taken to Frere Hospital again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are there any injuries that you sustained, maybe in one of your body parts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes there is a lot.  The bullet penetrated my back.  I have a problem in my spinal cord.  My right leg is paralysed.  I have got a kidney problem where I have an artificial valve in my kidney.  I will never survive without that artificial stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I notice that you are using crutches, are those the results of the injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes.  I have got only one leg now because the right one is not working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At the time you were shot at what standard were you doing at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> I was doing standard 10.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there any problem that you encountered at school at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes.  I couldn't sit for the exams in 1992 because I was kept in hospital until February 1993.  I couldn't stand up, I was in bed for the whole year.  In 1994 I went back to start with my standard 10.  In May I had this kidney problem, I had to undergo another operation, that was a drawback in my life.  When I came back in August I asked the principal for permission to write my exams.  I tried but I didn't succeed.  I tried in 1995 the supplementary exams.  What I think about this, my classmates used to come and tell me I am somewhere else, I am at the college, and if I was</p>

<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>2 D HLEKANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>ready I was preparing for my exams at the time, I just become confused when I get such news from my friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said sometimes while reading a book you just think about this particular day and it disturbs you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes I just become confused and have all the visions of that particular day, and then after that I cannot go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is there any other manner that you were affected in your health?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes. I cannot walk a long distance.  Even if I am walking I must know that I am walking on a flat slope because I am suffering from a backache.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Before you were shot at Bisho and sustained the injuries that you have told us about, what were your aims in life in your career, what were your aims academically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Because I am highly dependent on my father I told myself that when I pass standard 10 I am going to pursue nursing studies so that I will be able to get some allowance, and when I qualify I will try and further my studies at university level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your condition now can you be able to pursue your studies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> No I don't think so but I try because my parents advised me to go to the institution called Academy of Learning to do some computer studies so that if I happen to get a diploma I will be able to go back and finish my standard 10.  Right now I am at the Academy of Learning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you ever consult the legal representatives that were helping the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes I was.  I went to Smith and Tabatha and van Heerden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>3 D HLEKANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What was the outcome?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Everything was well in September on the 19th if I am not mistaken I received a cheque, the amount that I claimed, but they said the cheque delayed because I was supposed to get that claim December this year.  But as attorneys they made another application so that I can get the interest of that amount.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You got a certain amount of money that I wouldn't ask you to tell us about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes.  I got the money that I claimed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all that you would like to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS HLEKANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you very much.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
