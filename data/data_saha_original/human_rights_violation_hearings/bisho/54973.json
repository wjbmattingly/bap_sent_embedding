            "What happened is this.  We went to Bisho.  We met with the people who were demonstrating.  We followed them.  While I was at the stadium, as I was prepared to go down the stairs I heard the gunshots.  One person said lie down.  We went down the stairs rolling and they were just firing the bullets.  We went on.  There was a white car that was parked down there we, the others were under the car, those who were under the car were shot at and we realised that we were not safe next to that car.  There was a blue and white combi.  We tried to get inside that combi.  While I went in through the sliding door a lot of people were there.  I tried to force myself in.  I was shot on my right hand.  I just saw blood as we were pushing there with the other people trying to get inside the combi.  The driver was there but he was not the owner of the car and he didn't even have the keys.  he was just sitting next to the steering wheel because he was not the owner of the car.\n It was quiet for some time.  There was a van who was collecting all the people who were injured.  One of the people who were injured jumped the van.  I also decided to go there to that bakkie.  We continued collecting the people who were injured with this van.  We went to the hospital at King Williamstown.  We were treated there for injuries.  I \nEAST LONDON HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n1 M BLOM\nasked a question where are we going, how are we going to find our way home.  They said each and every person must go to the nearest hospital.  Then I went to Cecilia Makiwane Hospital.  When I asked the doctors how were they going to remove the bullet, they said this bullet is in a very delicate part of my body, they won't be able to remove it.\n I left the hospital.  I went to Cecilia Makiwane Hospital.  Even the doctors there told me that I must just leave this bullet, there is no way that it could be removed.  I was admitted there and the people used to visit us.  Though I could walk I stayed in hospital.\n On my second day in hospital the soldiers came.  It was during the night.  They asked for permission from the nurses that they would like to see their people who are in hospital.  The nurses said there are no soldiers here. And then the soldiers left.  We had to be removed from those wards so that when the soldiers come back again they wouldn't find us.  We had to change the place.  The only people who would know were the residents because they could identify us.  I was in hospital for three days.  I was discharged on the third day.",
