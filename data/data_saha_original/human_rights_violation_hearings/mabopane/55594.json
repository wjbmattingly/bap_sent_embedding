We hope you are not tired by now, we also thank you for coming here to tell us the story about your son, Patrick Monageng, who escaped to Swaziland in 1989. We therefore request you to tell us what happened to Patrick, what caused him to escape from this country.\n When he fled this country he was an activist of the ANC that was banned by then.",

But they said they wouldn't bury him in my absence and then we phoned them telling them that we were on our way to Swaziland. Before we went there the people who helped me asked me if I would like my son to be buried in Swaziland or in South Africa. I said if possible I would like him to be buried at home and then they said it's okay we'll try by all means to help you out. They then took me to Seriti (indistinct). We then went over to Swaziland to go and fetch my child to come and bury him at home, that is in Temba.\n The police came to me after the funeral, we buried him on a Saturday, and they came on Sunday morning and asked me what happened at home because they were only informed by the head office in Mafokeng that we are not guarding the place. Things that don't  know of are happening here and I said to them if you don't believe we have buried someone you can go to the graveyard and dig him up.",

So it seems to me that the last person will be Mr Mokoena, is that correct?\n I have a request here as I said, to announce when we will stop. It seems to me that in about half an hour, round about 4 o'clock we will stop. Some of you will have to make arrangements for transport because of the taxi problems at the moment. I hope that by round about 4 o'clock, in about half an hour, we will be finished with our meeting.",
