            "On 11 March at about 9 o'clock in the evening, I was at my friends called Madira. I left them and I was tired and decided to go and sleep. Whilst still lying on the bed I saw the police coming into the house, and they searched the house.\n After searching the whole house, the police left. At about something to eleven, I was asleep by then, and they came back. When I woke up I was awoken by sjamboks all over me and the beatings. When I opened my eyes there was a policeman called Vincent Drabalula, who was hitting me.\n When I was trying to find out what he beating me for, he said I was intending to kill him. He kept on hitting me and you know what was worse is that I had no clothes on me, because I was asleep. He pulled me from the bed and I fell down, and that's when he started kicking me and the others were just looking at him.\n He pulled me into the dining room, still hitting me. He kept on hitting me for a long time. They then took me along with them to Block 14, that is where Shadrach Stray stays. And then I said to them \"I can't climb on the hippo, it is very high.\" And they said I should climb on my own, they wouldn't help me. My leg was injured by then, and I didn't know how I got injured.\n I tried by all means to get on that hippo. When I got in, they didn't allow me to sit down. They said I must kneel and I couldn't do that. I had to do what they ordered me to say. When we got to our destination, that is where Shadrach stays, they said I must knock on the door. I did that. Shadrach opened the door and after opening, they searched his house.\n After searching, I don't know what they said to him, and they then put him in the hippo and drove away. We went to Block 12, when we got there, they got out of the hippo with Shadrach and they left me inside. \n I didn't know what they did in that house where we were, and then they came back with Shadrach and then we dropped him at his place. They drove with me until (indistinct) and they stayed with me until 5:00am. They were drinking beer by then.\n One of them called Homsa gave me a gun and said I must hold it on me and when (indistinct) comes across I must shoot him. I asked him \"Show me how they shoot\" and then one of them said \"It is not according to the rules that you should give this lady a gun\" and then he took the gun from me.\n When I was with them they kept insulting me until in the morning, and then they left me and said they don't want to see me on the roads. And then I went to my friend and told her that I was going to the hospital. I then went home and took a hospital file. After taking the file at home, I went across to Block 14 where Moses stayed. \n When I got there, there were bullet holes on the house, the windows were broken, there was (indistinct) of teargas canisters. And then I greeted Moses. After greeting him, I told him that the police had beaten me up. He told me that the police had also visited him and they shot at the house yesterday in the afternoon.\n I was told that the other guy had escaped and I was given money to go to the hospital. When I got to the hospital, the doctors worked on my teeth because they were also injured and my right leg was also injured. They gave me some treatment and ordered me to go home. I used to visit the hospital for check ups and I also told Moses I'm afraid to stay at home because my mother works and there is a possibility that the police will come back and fetch me when I'm alone at home. I'd rather stay with him.\n I thought they would, because they were grown ups, they could speak to the police when they came for me, and I stayed there with them and the police used to come around  and throw some teargas at us. I was then transferred to Garankuwa Hospital, and while still attending treatment there, I was supposed to go in for an operation.\n I was operated, and stayed for 3 months at Garankuwa Hospital, thereafter they discharged me. After being discharged, I wanted to open a case, and I wasn't allowed to do that by the Bop police. I didn't know what to do thereafter because I was on crutches and most of the time I was tired. Even after sitting in a car for a while, I would be very tired, and then I left everything.\n At the present moment I can't use my right leg, I can't even kneel on it. I can't stand for a longer period. All I can do with this leg is rest it.",

            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Betty, we've listened to your story and we feel with you, it was in 1992, it was five years ago when your life was shattered and your dreams and your ideals were shattered, when you were beaten up by the police, when you heard the terrible news of your boyfriend that was killed and everything fell apart. It must have been terrible but we are so grateful that you did survive in a wonderful way and we know that you suffer still from the marks of what happened to you but we do hope and do wish you all the best for the future.\n We will take up all these things that you've said, if you can provide us with that City Press article, and with the telephone number of this person in Garankuwa Hospital, it will help us a lot, and as soon as we can, we will come back to you with the information we have. Thank you for coming and please greet your family, your parents and also Moses' parents from all of us. Thank you very much.\n I would like to call now Mabina Mojapelo, Mabina Mojapelo. If there are still people in the hall that need to make statements, please remember that you can go outside and ask for Sello and he will help you to find somebody to make your statement to. We need all the statements that we can get from the area.",
