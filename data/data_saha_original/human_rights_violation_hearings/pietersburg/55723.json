They assaulted him, they removed his brain and eyes and he was taken to Kalefong hospital in 1980.\n This feud started at Muhamathlala.  When he came back from Kalafong he stayed for two years, he was paralysed, he could not walk he could not eat, he could not do anything because, I don't remember the other things. I can't remember all of the things.\n(confusion with the interpretation here)\n Our people were African National Congress, the others were TC, that is Traditional Chiefs and we don't know what they were fighting about because the TC and the Congress were fighting.  I don't know what TC means but it stands for Traditional Chiefs.  These were the TC people.",
