<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ABEL BAKGANE BALOYI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My father Johannes Baloi died, was killed in 1980 in January, he was killed in Muhamathlala by the government's people.  They assaulted him, they removed his brain and eyes and he was taken to Kalefong hospital in 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a> This feud started at Muhamathlala.  When he came back from Kalafong he stayed for two years, he was paralysed, he could not walk he could not eat, he could not do anything because, I don't remember the other things. I can't remember all of the things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>(confusion with the interpretation here)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> Our people were African National Congress, the others were TC, that is Traditional Chiefs and we don't know what they were fighting about because the TC and the Congress were fighting.  I don't know what TC means but it stands for Traditional Chiefs.  These were the TC people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What were the TC people doing, were they beating people up or were they supporting the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> They assaulted people, they burned the houses, they took all the cattle, goats and donkeys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Who was taking whose goats, whose cattle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> The government.  The first government, I don't know which government, whether it was the Lebowa Government or the South African Government, but the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What was he beaten for, either he belonged to the Congress or he belonged to the TC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> My father was a member of the Congress, he was beaten because he didn't want to go with the TC's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If I understand you well, you say the Congress people did not want to go to the lines whilst the TC people were forcing people to go to the lines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> In the conflict, where did the chiefs stand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>Was the chief on the side of the TC or on the side of the Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> That's what I don't know.  I can't tell you whether he was on the side of the TC or on the side of the Congress. I don't know many things about the chiefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> ...(indistinct) of your family after the death of your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Nothing, no one buried him.  No we are now staying at Divane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No we went away and built shacks somewhere in Divane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Thank you I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Baloi, if my sums are correct, looking at your ID number, you were about 24 years at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes I was 24 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you close to this when it happened, did your father tell you about the attack or where did you hear about it, did other people tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I'm saying here today, some of them I heard, some of them I was not there, I was in Johannesburg.  but some of them I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did I hear you correctly saying that your father died only later.  Was it two years after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> He died in 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I heard you saying that they removed his eyes and his brain and they took him to hospital, that was the translation that came through on the earphones, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did this happen at the time of the attack or after his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> No it happened when they attacked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'd like to ask only one question.  You have come to tell your experiences to us today, to share your testimony with us.  What do you think the TRC could do for you. Is it to get the facts behind the death of your father, what happened to him or do you have other requests? from the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> What I want the Commission to do for me, I want them to compensate me because my mother has two children, she is not working, she gets only a pension and we survive on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>(no interpretation here, only vernacular, there appears to be no interpretation from Bapedi to Tsongo)</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Have you been following Mr Baloi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Yes I was following it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You are needing a supporter to support you to come to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We are grateful, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BALOYI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> We are going to repeat, there are statement takers at the back.  If there are those people who still want to give statements, they should go to the back and give their statements.  Again there are some head sets which are still missing.  Those who want to borrow them, they can borrow them but you must bring them back any time we adjourn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> We also would like to inform you that amongst us here there are senior people that we'd like to introduce to you. We have got the Mashamba family, can you please stand up. There they are behind, thank you, and we have Mr Godfrey Bitters who is with us here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> We would like to welcome to the proceedings of the Truth Commission, the mayor of Pietersburg Mrs Schofield, from the Premier's office Mr Petty and the Director of the Northern District Mr Mkwane.  Welcome to the proceedings and thanks for coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a> I also would like to inform you about the head sets, that they can only be used by those people who don't understand the language which is used here on the stage. You don't have to bother about them.  Thank you.</p>
