            "I would like to welcome you all on behalf of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee to this the second day of our hearings in the East Rand.   Yesterday we were in Tiduza, today we are here, tomorrow we will be in Vosloorus.\n We are very pleased and grateful to the local Council for letting us use these facilities.  We are very pleased that you are all here.  We would like to welcome you very warmly to this hearing and what I will do first is just to explain some of the procedures so that you get a better idea for those who had not been at hearings before, to get an idea of what happens.\n Firstly, in terms of interpretation you will see that we do have interpretative facilities here for everybody and there are earphones, microphones available for everybody.   Those who need them, the three channels, if I could explain:  English is on two;  Zulu is on three;  Sotho is on four.\n I must make one appeal on behalf of all of us about these earphones.  They are intrinsically tied up to this system.   They do not function outside of this system.  So the message is, please make sure that when you use them, you use them here and here only and when you leave, you leave them behind.   Thanks very much.\nSecondly I would like to explain, you have copies of the programme for today.  I would like to explain that Committee member, Tom Manthata is with us but is not chairing.  I will be chairing the session today.  My name is Hugh Lewin.  I am on the Human Rights Violations Committee and I would like to introduce the rest of the panel. \n We have with us today, from my left Tom Manthata, who is a Committee member of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee;  on my immediately left is Dr Russell Ally, who is a Committee member of the Human Rights Violations Committee;  on my immediate right is Ms Joyce Seroke, who is also a Committee member of the Human Rights Violations Committee and then on my extreme right is Dr Fazel Randera, who is a Commissioner of the Human Rights Violations Committee.  He is also the Convener of the Gauteng area of the Commission.\n What we will do during the day, you will see that we will do the cases.   There is a break for tea and there is a break for lunch, but those who have not been here before will see how the day proceeds.\n I would like to make one appeal.  Cell phones please, off.   We do not need to be interrupted by cell phones.  \n I would also like to make the point that these hearings are essentially a day for the witnesses to come forward and tell their stories.  Everything we do, everything about the day is geared quite specifically for those who are coming to make statements.   If you think about it you will realise that it is quite an undertaking to do that.\n We welcome the witnesses very warmly and we ask \neveryone to respect the fact that this is their day.  This is their time for telling those stories.\n I would also like to explain that those who are \nappearing today as witnesses, their statements have been chosen from a large number of statements that we have had.  The areas that are covered specifically today include Benoni, obviously, Wattville, Actonville and Daveyton.  \n And, what we try to do with the hearings is to make the statements as representative as possibly, both in chronological time, also in terms of the activities and the events that are taken place in the particular areas.\n What we need to stress as well, is the fact that some people are chosen to appear in public and some people who have made statements and do not appear in public makes no difference at all to the way in which these statements are treated by the Commission.   \n Every statement that is made to the Commission by people, recounting their pain, their suffering during the years as covered by the Commission, 1960 to 1994, every statement is treated exactly the same and will be treated in exactly the same way in the final report of the Commission.  I think that does need to be stated.\n I would now like to ask is we could please stand and I would call on Rev Mbanda, who is from the Anglican Church in Daveyton to lead us please in prayer before we start our proceedings.  Rev Mbanda thank you.",

            "Ja, I am Victor Nkwamba and we are family of five, my father, my mother and my two sisters.  I am there only son.\n So, in 1976 I was 17 years old and I was at Edward Secondary School, doing Form Two and on 21st of June 1976, it was a Monday and I was on my way home from school and the roads that I usually used was occupied by the police and it was very tense at school.  We had to be out of the classes.  So, I was avoiding the roads that I usually took.  So, I took the other roads that I thought was safe, that was Mokwatsi Street.  So when I was in the middle of the road I heard a bullet shot, but before that when I was just in the middle of the road I saw a police, aiming a gun at me, but before he could shoot I ducked swiftly and started now running up the street.\n So, when I was a few houses up the street then I heard a shot.  Then I was shot and I was down.  So they came with a Hippo and stood next to me and the police was looking at me like that, while I was bleeding, holding my hands just like this.\n So, one of the police told the other police just to finish me off.  He said this in Afrikaans, skiet hom dood.  So before he could shoot, they were disturbed by the school kids who were in a distance far away. \n So, they drove off.   So the kids, they school kids, took me to hospital on the same day and I was admitted and I lost my consciousness at the hospital and I recovered after four days.  \n Then I did not know where I was until I was told by the nurses that I was shot by the police.\n So, I stayed a long time in hospital and I suffered a lot.  I am still in pains even today.  I am using pain tablets each and every day.   And it is really hard.\n It was an operation after an operation.  I had to undergo about four operations.  One was to remove the bullet and my right arm here, I cannot use it fully, because now the bullet went through my right arm here and penetrated my school bag and right on here in my back.  So, the spinal cord was affected.  So, I cannot use both of my legs, of which I am classified as a paraplegic.\n After a while I was discharged from hospital.  I started to write letters to the Ministers to inform them about this matter, what they have done to me.  The first person I wrote to was Le Grange, the Minister of Police, that was in 1981.   \n So, they came to take a statement at my place and \nthey asked some questions, which I answered very well, because I know very well what happened to me.  \n And after some time I received a letter from them, informing me that they heave dealt with these matters, all the claims that emanated during the period of 1976 to 1977, they have dealt with and no longer now can they consider my case.\n So, I kept on writing letters to the Ministers.  It was Minister after Minister, until before the election then I wrote a letter - because I know the Government was going to change - to inform them about these, because I wanted now to be compensated for the suffering I have encountered.  \n And after the ANC Government took over, I wrote a letter again to the Minister of Police and Safety, Mr Mufamadi, to inform him about these, thinking about that he would do something about this.  But, unfortunately he referred the matter to the Commissioner of Police in \nGermiston and all these other places and they did not really do nothing about this.   \n And until the TRC was formed, I think there was a chance for me to tell my story what happened to me.  Because I really want to know who shot me and for what reason, because I was still very young.  I had a future.  So he destroyed all that and being now the only son in my family my parents had high hopes for me.  So all their hopes were put down the drain.  \n So my mother still suffers.  She still cannot really sleep.   So, they are now very old.  So, we are struggling in the family, without getting help from anywhere.   \n So, is only the Truth Commission can do something \nabout this then I think we can be on our way to reconciliation.  I can start now try to forget about what happened to me, though it would not be an easy thing to forget about it, because really I have suffered enough at a young age, like that 17 years old.\n Really I want to know who shot me for what reason.  Before that person really come out and tell me why he shot me like this.  Then that will be something.",

Originally you were told that when you first asked for compensation you were told that in terms of the Indemnity Act which the then Government passed, nobody would be liable for any compensation for any event which occurred between 1976.  So the police had covered themselves with an Indemnity Act.\n You then later wrote again and asked for \ncompensation.  You then wrote again to the new Government, to Mr Sydney Mufamadi's office, the present Minister of Police.   You were told then that your demand for compensation had expired because of the date.  It was in 1976 and this was now in 1995 and it had expired.\n And there was then a discussion about an ex gratia payment.  And the way the ministry explained this, they said ex gratia payments, I think which they do only under exceptional circumstances, and that those payments have to come from the existing budgets of ministries, and therefore ministries only do that if the circumstances in their view, are very desperate.\n But then at the conclusion of the letter the \nCommission says that should your intention be to proceed with your claim, the courts could be approached for the necessary relief, so they suggested to you to go to the court.  \n Did you ever follow up on that?  Did you try to go to a legal aid or a legal resource centre.",

To make recommendations to the President for reparation and for rehabilitation of victims, but you have to understand that that process only starts at the end of the life of the Commission.  At the end of the life of the Commission we make recommendations, which is only in December.\n That then have to go to the President, it has to go \nto Parliament and that has to be debated and discussed.  We have no powers to pay out any monies or any compensation.  We can only make recommendations.  The power is in the hands of the Government.\n But this is an invitation to you by the ministry to say that if you want to proceed with this thing further maybe you should consider the courts.  Maybe you should consider and if you would perhaps want assistance on how to proceed along these lines with either the Legal Resources Centre or Legal Aid.  Maybe that is one avenue to try and see what kind of legal avenues are open to you in the interim.\n Because as I have said there is a long period between when the Commission ends and makes recommendations and now, at least a year.

I mean you are one of those people whom we salute, because of your suffering, I think because of your courage and the way that you have shown, those of us who were not affected in the drastic way that you were, have shown us through the years how to continue, how to survive.\n Yes it is a terrible thing for you and we will obviously do what we can.   Russell has explained about the way in which we will make recommendations.  How the Reparations Committee make recommendations to Parliament, but obviously that will affect both medical support, possible medical support for you, possible support for your education.\n What we would, what I would like to say is, you know, continue in that way.  The fact that you have come forward as you have, shows tremendous courage and tremendous fortitude. And we would salute you for that and recommend that you stay in touch.  You are not alone, do not forget that.  There are unfortunately large numbers of people in the same position as you are.  \n We would recommend that you contact and make use of that network.  And obviously come back to other people.\n Before you go I think there is nice coincidence.  You mentioned in your statement that on that day, 21 years ago, one of the people who was a fellow student who actually helped you to the hospital, was one Cyril Rabotata who is sitting as our Media Officer for the TRC, and sitting with the media.  That is a nice conjunction.\n Thank you very much for coming.",
