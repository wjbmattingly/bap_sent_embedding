            "Thank you for being given the time.  What happened on the Monday I was at home and I ate.  Within a while I was feeling so tired and I go to sleep.  When I was asleep I wake up again and then do the cookings and when I went to sleep again, and then while I asleep I was surprised to find a policeman coming knocking and then when he knocked my husband came and they said, is this the place of Machudo Neuvhirwa and they said we want to go with you to court and  my husband refuses and said he can't go to Sibasa and then I wake up where I was asleep.  I find that policeman talking, forcing him to go with him and the policeman asked me to go with him to Sibasa and then I refused saying that I don't know Sibasa since I was here at Messina and he forced us that we must go to Sibasa and we asked him why and he said we'll hear why we are sent, called there at, in front that Sibasa.\n From there, we stopped there and we were taken to a certain house there at Sibasa and then we were given a chair and then we sat down.  While we were seated another policeman came in.  He took me to the other office where there were three policewomen.  There those policewomen asked me my full names.  I told them that I'm Gladys Neuvhirwa.  Then they said okay.  I was then taken again to another bench.   While I was seated another policeman came in and he took me to another office where there were White men.  Others were sitting even on top of the table and I was given a chair to sit.  While I was seated I was asked whether I know Machudo Neuvhirwa.  Then I said, I know him.  So they asked when he disappeared from you and then I said from Sunday, 6 o'clock and then they told us that Machudo was with someone and they went to them near a shop called camp and they said that Machudo climbed their store and I said, is it?  They said, yes.  And they said that there were people who were working for contract there.  Then when Machudo was  seeing those tractors, Machudo was disturbed and then he fell down and he died.  And they asked my if there is anything that I can answer and I told them that what I can answer is this, that Machudo climbed the shop, I'm not sure and they said they will give me the evidences.  They told me that Machudo now is dead, at half past one, in the afternoon and is dead.  So, I was so tired and I was, because he can't die without being ill and they told me that he died at half past one.  When asking those policemen whether there is something that I can say, I told them that I've got something that I want to tell them.  I, I said I, I'm asking them to give me a car to go and fetch the parents of  this Robert.  I went to the parents and then I take Jeremino Neuvhirwa and Lusino Neuvhirwa and then came back with them.  \n In arriving back on Tuesday, we were taken to another office where we were asked if we were parents of the deceased and then we said, yes and they said Machudo is dead because he climbed the shop and seeing the contractors coming next to him, he was disturbed and then he fell down and then the contractors brought him to a police station  and then my father asked to see the constructors and then the police said you will see constructors during the trials.  From now nothing is going on.  One day while to hear what was happening in the post-morten, while we were asking what was happening because the trial is going nowhere, they said we must go and investigate what's the case and send the police what's happening.  And then we refused because we thought things were not properly.  The police were so angry with me that I never thought, I thought, I even thought that this is not a police station.  While we were at home policeman, Mr Mathius Tjika came in and asked me if I have investigated the case and I asked them, is it true that I must investigate the case instead of you, the policeman?",
