            "On that day, this is what happened.  It was in the evening when we held a meeting in our hall.  Suddenly we arranged to go to, it was told there are people who will go to town to buy, whosoever could buy cool, could really face, be faced with a lot of problems and then we'll have representations.  The following morning I woke up and bathed.  I put on my uniform, ANC uniform and went to town.  Arriving on town I sat there.  As I was seated a train arrived from Jo'burg.  There were people going to Zimbabwe.  Some of them were off-loading, I mean alighting, some of them were going to the shops and I had to rush to those people to stop them.  There was a factory which is now closed.  When I stopped those people, I was trying to explain to them that we are engaged in a consumer boycott and people are not allowed to buy here in these shops because we are fighting against the boers, 'cause we are fighting, we have some problems around and the Zimbabwean women were explaining to me that, well, we know well about the South African war and we are not involved because South African people were not also involved in our Zimbabwean fight in 1966.  I then explained that by then I was till a very young person.  I was getting born.  We just want you to support us as our fellow Black people.  Please don't buy and those people went to the shops and bought and then I explained to them furthermore and we went towards the railway station.  Arriving at the railway station, whatever they had bought, they had a lot of plates and I just broke them.  When breaking them I also took all the soaps.  Suddenly Zee Moiana arrived.  When Zee Moiana arrived he, he said to me, what are you doing?   And I told Zee Moiana , that as police you know very well that we are in a terrible situation.  I explained it to these people that they shouldn't buy or they must buy in Jo'burg and go to Zimbabwe because we are still engaged in a struggle here.  He held me on my clothes and then he, he took me to the station, police station and we went there.\n When we were at the office, they took me around to another private office.  Whilst we were there, there was another  White  man Backs, who was watching over the window and he followed us.  He clapped me on my face.  After having done that he ordered me to sit down and told me that I was not really illiterate or educated in what I was doing.  I just kept quite, I couldn't respond.  Zee then started taking some books and pulled them down and there was a docket.  He told me that there was a docket that was going to be opened.  I admitted to the statement taking and then he said to me, the people who are encouraging you to do this are not going to be in such trouble and very soon you are involved in these struggles and you are not even educated and I asked him if at all the struggle really necessarily need people who are educated or only the people who are Blacks, fellow Blacks?  Then when those women were taken they were just put outside.  I had to take statement.  There was nothing that I had to say there.  I said I will have to say something in court and he said, you are very stubborn and those women were called to the office.  I was put in a very private office like these where the people are interpreting.  There were some burglar doors there.  They didn't close the outside door.  After that I was put there aside.  I asked to go to the toilet.  Having done so Backs told me that there was no toilet and he said, just do it there and I sat there.  As I was seated there I could feel that I was really pressurized.  I had to urinate and I just did it there.  After that it was late afternoon towards three or four.  I told them about my hunger.  I asked for food and the people who were buying food, who had bought food from the cafe, they ate the food.  After having eaten, they just gave me part of the food.  I said, I cannot eat this dirt,  I'm not a dog.  I wouldn't mind staying hungry for such a long time.  I will just go and eat in the cell. Then I just pushed to the food away and then they asked me to fetch the food again.  The statement was taken.  That was around past six, past five to six.  I went, I was taken by a van, four by four.  Backs took the, I was handcuffed, I, I was cuffed on one of my legs and I went to the police station.  They took me to the charge office and I was booked in, in a book and the cuffs were taken off.  I went to the cells.  I had to ask for people to  relay a message home that whosoever will see Orbit or Abraham Lerule or Jackie Makombi to tell them that I'm in the police station.  There was a message that Jeanet shall not be a worried because we will be coming to release her the following day.  I couldn't worry.  I stayed there in a cell.  Subsequently, my own people from home brought food.  I ate the food and slept.  \n The following day, in the morning, I went to court.  When I was in the court I was told that my involvement in such case was very major and there was a bail that had to be given up.  Orbit went and fetched the money for the bail.  I was released and there were taxis, so there were a lot of people inside.  I boarded the taxi and went to the hall.  On arriving at the hall  people explain as to what happened on my arrest during the boycott times and now he's back.  There, but there was no problem at all.  The others will have to be consulted and that court was postponed.  The following day a lawyer, Ntai, arrived who asked me several questions and I explained to him and he was the one who was going to represent.  It was postponed more than three times.   I was discharged.  Thank you.",

He was said to have been coming from Pietersberg and there was no time.  The, Patrick Makado was trying to explain on a loud hailer and the dogs were just on us and the rubber bullets were on us and we were running away.  Whilst we were running I ran, I had to take cover in a shop in one White man's shop, so called Bopa and as he was about to close, he chased me away and I went out.  When I went out, I went to the other side of, of the hospital.  As I arrived at our own hospital, there was a van which approached and some other three privates and another van.  This other van had a lot of dogs and they started, you know, breaking all, you know, the cars stopped and everybody was demonstrating.

That's, that's the impression I got from what you said, that he said that what you did was not necessarily the correct thing to do.  Can you, can you just clarify.

Well, I must monentrarily decline, I must just be a back-bencher or a supporter from behind and not that prominent.  Well, I was not that frightened.

What you have described is a story that we've heard so many times as we've travelled through the length and breadth of the country.  Your arrest, the detention, the treatment that you were given but I want to go back to something the Mayor said earlier when he was talking about how our, how our democracy has come about and I think part of that democracy is to respect people's human rights regardless of which political side they may, they may be coming from and I hope that your experience that you had in those years is never repeated within the political history of our country now.  So, thank you very much for coming and you will be hearing from us in due course.  Thank you.",
