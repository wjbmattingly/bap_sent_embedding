<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> You were working at the time.  Where were you working?</p>

<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> It was Frere Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> On the way, something happened, what was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> My brothers took me, while my brothers were taking me to the hospital, we met a police casper where  policemen asked me what happened and I told them what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a> And they slapped me across the face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> For what reason did they do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> I don't' know the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did they say anything to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> Nothing, they said nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Do you know who they were at all, do you recognise any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> ; I don't know them because it was late in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Your statement says that you had to spend some time in hospital as a result of all of this, another hospital, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did you ever consult an attorney about what had happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> I didn't consult an attorney because I spent six months in Queenstown because I burnt my clothes since they were full of blood and at home they just decided that I am insane, so I stayed for six months in Queenstown, I didn't get a chance to go to the lawyers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Do you feel that it helped you, that hospital?  Did it help you, do you feel that you are well now?</p>

<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">M MAKEKE:</span> Yes, I'm taking treatment.</p>

And at least the Commission should be of assistance to me.</p>

<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> On the 11th of August I was at Galine with Goodboy's father.  We heard some gunshots outside, while we were still there, we heard some teargas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a> We decided to go outside so that we can get shot.  But when we were going out another canister was right at the door, we were the first to run away with the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> In your statement you say that the cause of Goodwill's death was the fumes of that teargas, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> We were also affected and the child also, but the child is much younger than us.  We are not the same, we are not affected the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now you say that you went to some attorneys in Pefferville, and that you don't remember their names.  Are these attorneys still at Pefferville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> At Pefferville I was called since my child was affected by this teargas, I was called to explain what was happening.  We were told that an attorney from Gauteng is coming to take this kind of, to listen to this kind of explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did you actually go to court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> No, I didn't go to the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And when these people came, you spoke to</p>

<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is there anything else that you want to tell us about that event particularly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> I didn't put it in my statement, my child didn't die on that particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Explain further for me please.  What happened then?</p>

<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> I don't know the name of the Doctor, but he is one of the casual Doctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Would you recognise him if you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> Yes, I can recognise him, but I'm not sure if he is still there, because he was a little bit old then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> How long then was it before Goodwill died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">NJ WILI:</span> The whole thing happened on a Monday and then we went to the hospital on a Tuesday.  I went back again on a Wednesday.  He was still alive in the morning on that</p>
