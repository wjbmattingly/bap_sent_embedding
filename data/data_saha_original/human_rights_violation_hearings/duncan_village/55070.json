Even if you wish that we must bring the perpetrators forward for compensation, though we know that that is not the aim of the  Commission, but we know that that is your wish, our investigation is based on finding the perpetrators and bringing them forward to tell the truth, so that after that there would be reconciliation, but we have taken into consideration your wishes and your request.\n We are going to forward them to the President who will be the one who will be looking at all your requests.  Thank you very much, you can now go back to your seat.",
