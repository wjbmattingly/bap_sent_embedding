<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>2 NE THOLE</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>as you know what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS THOLE:</span> Yes, I will tell you.  Yes, I can explain.  My brother Zandisile Thole was shot on the Monday, in the morning and men had been asked to go outside and he was sleeping.  People came in our house and they said all men must go outside and my brother went outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> There is a street called Bomele Niomzamo, we found him ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Sorry I want to interrupt you.  There are people listening in the house, there are people listening on their radios around South Africa.  They are listening because they want to hear your story.  Please when you are talking, be clear so that people can hear you, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">NE THOLE:</span> It was on Monday when Zandisile was shot.  People came at home in the morning, they said that all men must go outside, and he was sleeping at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> And they came to my house and they told us that all men must go outside and he also went outside.  When they were around the Bemene Street near Mzamo, someone came at my house and told us that Zandisile was shot on the corner and we went there and we saw that he was shot at the head and in his leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> We didn't find any car so that we can take him to the hospital, some boys helped us to take him, to try to take him to the hospital.  When we approached Gonstown, we saw a car coming because there were no cars near Duncan Village and then we went through the Coloured area in Buffalo Flats, we went to the hospital and the hospital was so full, we waited for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> And they came and took him to the wards, we left him there.  We went back home with the car.  On Tuesday we went </p>

<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>3 NE THOLE</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>to the hospital to look for him, it was so difficult for us, we also went through the Coloured area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a> In hospital they told us to wait, and we waited.  While we were still waiting, two nurses came to us - they told us that he died yesterday, he didn't survive.   That is when we knew that he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Can you tell me about the funeral, were there any incidents at the funeral?</p>

<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">NE THOLE:</span> On the funeral day he was buried, but whilst we were still there, people said that the soldiers were near the holes in the stadium.  We waited there for a long time before we can go to bury him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">NE THOLE:</span> No, we didn't go to any attorneys because we didn't have money, he was the only breadwinner at home.</p>

<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Will you tell us what happened as you understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZWELIFILE:</span> What happened on that Tuesday of August, there were men who came to my house and they, when they arrived at home, they said that they want all men to be outside.  They didn't respond to that and this people waited outside and they said that they want all men to go outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a> And my mother said to the children they must go outside, I am the oldest and my brothers are younger than me.  I said to my mother, they are younger, they should not go outside and I said to my mother she doesn't know who wants them and why they are wanted and then he woke them up and said they must go outside and they went outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a> They left us there at home, they were shot and my older brother came back home and he didn't, he wasn't shot.  The other one - he was shot in his heart where there was an ID book in his pocket.  My mother said that that looked like my son and it was him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>5 N ZWELIFILE</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a> He was taken there and he was dead at that time, people were not aware that he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a> They wanted to take him to hospital, but they couldn't.  When the car arrived the owner of the car got injured.  He was shot, but fortunately ... (tape ends)  My older brother was fainting because he was so shocked at home.  My mother was so afraid, he was so scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a> He asked me to go to Cambridge because they were so afraid, they were not strong, they were weak.   They wanted me to go there to take my brother to the mortuary.  They asked me what happened, and then I said that people arrived at my home and I don't know who they are.  I didn't see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> We waited for the funeral day, praying and soldiers used to come while we were still praying and the comrades used to come to my house to pray and the soldiers used to go there every time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a> We were so scared, even when the comrades were praying for us, we were so afraid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Ms Zwelifile, I'm going to stop you at that point and I want to ask you a question.  You say that after he was certified dead and a year later, you were told to go to court.  Will you tell us about what happened at court please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZWELIFILE:</span> I received a letter from court and then I asked my brother to accompany me there.  We went to the court, I didn't go to the courtroom, I just went to another room, to the private room.  And I was asked a question of whether my brother hit the police with stones and then I said I didn't know that, because my brother was not alone.  And he didn't throw stones to the police.</p>

<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Can you tell me how they tried to persuade you.  You said they tried to persuade you, what did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZWELIFILE:</span> I just asked them whether that's the only question they wanted to ask me and then they said that's all.  And I left the letter there, they didn't ask me any other questions.  I asked my brother who was that police and then he said the one is Nqawe and my brother didn't know who others were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did you have any further harassment from the police after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZWELIFILE:</span> No, but they stopped me while I was coming from my work, from my job - we're not employed at home.  They stopped me and they wanted to beat me, they wanted me to return the food of which my boss gave me, because they said we didn't like whites, so I should return back the food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> In your statement you have asked that you wanted some form of reparation for the son who is the son of Bonakele, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZWELIFILE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Would you like to tell me what you mean by some form of reparation, what do you mean exactly?  Do you want help with education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZWELIFILE:</span> My request is that I want his mother to be helped, because their father died when they were still young.  My mother brought them here in East London and I was working for them.  He is old now and I want him to be educated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you very much Mr Zwelifile, I hand you back to the Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>Zwelifile, I was referring to that lady next to you - we would like to thank you for coming here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> For bringing the evidence in front of this Commission about the death of your brothers.  Your brothers died in the struggle between the South African Defence Force and the people of Duncan Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a> As we are listening to the stories, it becomes clear to us that the situation you are presenting to us, is a struggle.  It was a war which required people to loose their lives to compensate.  Your brothers, both of them, Bonakele and Zandisile, they fought and they died in this war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a> We would like to thank you on behalf of the Commission for coming in front of the Commission and we guarantee that the Commission will look upon your requests and even if the President has done something or even if he hasn't done anything, but you have to know that your brothers are amongst those who fought for this country.</p>
