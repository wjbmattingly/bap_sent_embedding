<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> There is some noise outside which is a disturbance to us, so I suggest we adjourn and to come back at eleven o'clock, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson.  Rogers, could you come closer to the microphone.  What is your claim name Rogers?</p>

<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Let us take it easy.  Now you say you were shot by the police, could you tell us in full what was happening on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> We were in the Roman Catholic Church where there</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>2 R GQEME</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>was a meeting of the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What kind of a meeting was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> It was a meeting for the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> These White people came in a casper and parked outside and sent someone, a tall man who looked like a Coloured person, and was dressed like a Minister of religion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And what did he say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> He asked, he said that we were asked to go out of this hall and to disperse by order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you go away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No, we didn't.  The house, the room was full and people were chanting freedom songs and some people did not hear what this man was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Then, did you ultimately leave the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> This White person insisted that we should go out of the hall and disperse and this took about 15 minutes and we went away as people who were standing outside, since the hall was packed and we were in fear that these Whites were going to shoot us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> As you were there, did you go as a crowd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> Yes, we walked passed these Whites.  Some of us walked down Dendes Street and down Dunga Street and we joined the rest and the bridge.  Those - that was the crowd that was toyi-toying and we moved towards Sipunzana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is this the time when this White person came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> They followed us in their casper, leaving the people behind in the hall, following the march.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So when you saw the caspers, did you run away and scatter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>3 R GQEME</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No, we didn't, instead we proceeded and then these policemen started shooting at us, but some of us who were not aware until we got next to the cemetery and I could see people running away, people falling and then as I was going up I could see a certain White man in a casper and he called me, but I ran away and he shot me in the arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And after you were shot, you actually took you to hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> I ran away and he again shot me on the waist and I fell facing upwards and I asked him to pick me up.  I struggled trying to stand, though I was aware that I had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> Then I could see that I was injured and my legs were feeling very weak.  Then this White person came to me, handled me by the collar, pulled me towards the casper and there were two of these caspers parked there and he placed me just behind one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Now, what ultimately happened.  Did you end up landing in hospital?  At the end of all this struggle, did they take you to the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> Yes.  The police took me to hospital and they were assisted by some people to take me onto the police truck which drove to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you see any Doctor in the hospital?  Did you get any attention from any Doctor there in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> When I got to hospital I was driven into the OPD in a stretcher and there was a White Doctor who looked at me and there was a big hole here on my hip and he asked these White men why they had injured me so severely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> And these White persons laughed because they were young, very young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>4 R GQEME</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> I would like to ask a question.  Do you perhaps know the name of this Doctor who attended to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No, I don't know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> But could you identify him if you were to see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> Yes, I think I could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> In your story I want to know was there any investigation after this shooting or perhaps did you institute a claim or did you perhaps get any compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No, I didn't do any of those.  We didn't even make an attempt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were you working at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> Yes, I was working at Westbank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were you able to work after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> Yes, I was working, but it was very difficult, because I still have a bullet that is still embedded in my spine because they could not take it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you perhaps go back to your old employers or did you have to look for a new job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> When I was discharged at the place where I used to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did those people accept you back when you were discharged from hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No, my employers discharged me as soon as I was released from hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you know the name of them?  Do you know the name of the factory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> It is called the NCI Industry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> When you were discharged, did you perhaps get any grant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>5 R GQEME</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you still get medical treatment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> No, I seldom go to hospital to get some medical treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you perhaps have any wish or any requests that you have to say to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> I wish this Commission could organise that I get medical treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And is there any other requests you have in addition to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> I also wish that this Commission could investigate about this person who shot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is there any other thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> I want to see this perpetrator face to face because I will never forgive him, I just don't have peace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is that all you have to say or is there anything you would like to say in addition to what you have said already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">R GQEME:</span> I also wish that this Commission could be of assistance to me because I - my health is not good, I don't feel all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you, I hand you over to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> We thank you.  We are now going to ask Nomonde Cynthia Mahlanza to come forward.</p>

<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> My claim name is Nozulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Could you tell us your story and tell us what happened to you on the 14th of August.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> I saw some White people coming into my house and they took my brother away and they put him on the</p>

<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>casper and they left with him that afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a> Then I asked my children that we should pray when he did not come back.  Early the following day a certain person came to tell us that my brother had come and my brother was taken to hospital and as the Doctor was examining my brother, my brother died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who is Mzwandile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> Mzwandile is a boy who lives in our neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you perhaps know his name?</p>

<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was there any investigation about this death?  His body - was there any post-mortem that was done or any inquest that was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How old was your brother when he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> I don't know, but he was born in 1959.  In fact the one that died was born in 1964.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What is your request to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> I'm asking that the Commission should help me because I have three young children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Whose children are these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> No, they are my sister's children and they are dependent on me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you perhaps get any grant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> Yes, I've just got this grant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is that all you have to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Tiny Maya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Ms Mahlanza, I would like to ask you some questions.  You say there was some SADF soldiers who came to collect your brother.  Do you perhaps know who these soldiers were?  Is there any other person who saw this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> Yes, there are many people, because it was in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> So you last saw your brother when these soldiers came to fetch him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And the last time you heard, was that he was injured?  Is there any person who told you the extend of the injuries or what had happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> No, I don't know, but I think they assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What did Mzwandile say - he met your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> He said he met him somewhere crawling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> According to what you know, was he still in a position to speak at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In our statement here you say he died from assault and from kicking.  Where did you get all this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> They got this information from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> I was assuming that they had assaulted him and kicked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there any eyewitness that actually saw when they were hitting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> No there wasn't none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did he have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">NC MAHLANZA:</span> No, he did not have any children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>8 M MVUBU</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> We are now going to ask Mzwakhe Mvubu. (tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> (tape starts) ... and whilst I was at the bridge just nearby I saw some White policemen and soldiers coming from one direction.  There was some other people in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were these people, were this White persons dressed in uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> Yes, they were in caspers.  I then saw one of the people in front of me falling.  I immediately ran away and I think that is when I was shot and I fell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a> I lost consciousness, when I regained consciousness, I was in hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How long were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> I was there for two months.  And I had to go for some therapy for my arm.  The Doctor who was a Doctor Appavo, when I was discharged, I went back to work, but I still felt pain on my head and I went to a Doctor for an examination and I told him that I had some pain on my head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a> And he asked whether I had ever been injured, and I explained, so he sent me for X-rays and he could determine that there were still some bullets on my head which are still embedded right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did they take you back at work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And so you worked for a while.  How did you stop to work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> They accused me of stealing paint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> They were selling paint and I gave some money to</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>9 M MVUBU</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>a certain Coloured person but I was the one who were accused as having stolen this paint and after all this is the paint that I had paid for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you refer this matter to the Union and what did they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> I did refer the matter to the Union and they asked me to appeal to a court, but later on they said everything depended on my employers.  So when Mr Pinnock, the Director came, this White person - this employer said they had discovered that I had paid the money, but they laid another charge now that I had used some other empty tins and so they asked me to leave my work, so I reported the matter to the Union.</p>

<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> No, I did not apply for one, but my wife gets some part-time job.  Unfortunately she got pregnant and she had to stop working.  My request to this Commission is that I cannot get employment full time, because they always see that I have got a problem with my health and now I see that I do not have a bright future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a> Therefor I request that this Commission should pay for my children's education. </p>

<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> Yes, I did go to lawyer Lalla and his secretary who was a Black told me that I was late because after three months, they do not accept a case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> At the time you went to Mr Lalla, how long was it after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">M MVUBU:</span> It was four months after the incident, because I spent two months in hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> We thank you Mr Gqeme, Ms Mahlanza and Mr Mvubu for your evidence and testimony as given to the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a> Mr Gqeme mentioned something which people may misconstrue when he said when we were looking at him, he said he would like to see this people face to face, referring to the perpetrators and he said that he hasn't got peace with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a> Though this may be taken by other people up otherwise, but it is sending a message to the perpetrators of this atrocities that what they did to the people should not be considered lightly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a> Though I see that they did not care what has been done by the Truth Commission.  They did not have a deep consideration of what they have done.  We therefor want to </p>

<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>send word to them that they should listen that peace and reconciliation in this country, is solely dependent on them by them taking everything serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a> They have injured and shattered people's lives whereby people have got to go on living with some bullets within their bodies and this is something very serious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a> And we therefor wish that the people who are responsible for all this should come forward on their own, so that this Commission should make them see the people they did all these things to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a> If they do not come forward, there is just no possibility of reconciliation.  We therefor thank you for bringing forward your testimony.  We are going to look into all the things you have said to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a> And I will therefore ask you to take your seats.</p>
