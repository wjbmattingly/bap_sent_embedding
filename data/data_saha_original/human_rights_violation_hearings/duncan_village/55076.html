<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you - I've sworn them in Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Over to you Ntsikelelo Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  Let me greet you Ms Zenzisi.  How are you Ms Zenzisi today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> No, I'm fine. How are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I'm also fine, thank you since we last saw each other yesterday, now could I ask you to come closer to the microphone as you speak so that you can be clearly heard.  Even this behind me, the interpreters should be in a position to hear you as you explain and tell us about your painful story.  Let's first start off by referring to your statement which we have here in front of us.  Your husband, on the 14th of August was shot and died - is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Just before you explain to us about this incident, could you briefly explain and tell us about your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>What work was he doing at the time?  Could you again repeat?  Your husband - what kind of a person was he?  Was he a worker or was he unemployed?  What was he doing at the time he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> He was working at Kasif and in 1984 this Company closed and then they were retrenched and he was unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So at the time he was shot, was he unemployed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Right, let's move on and get into the main point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> It was on a Tuesday morning and we woke up.  My husband went to the shop to go and buy cooldrink.  As I was sitting there I decided to go outside because I could hear some gunfire and I saw some people and I joined them.  DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>5 M ZENZISI</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>As I was standing there, a young child came to me and said -and told me that my husband had been shot.  He was one of </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>the people that had been shot and when I asked her for the second time, the people stopped me and whilst I was standing there, still considering what I had just heard from the child, I decided to go to one direction.  As I was walking there where the people were laying, I met my brother and he asked me where I was getting to and I told him where I was getting to.  And he asked me to go back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a> I was interested to go and see what was happening there, where there were people, so I stood there with my brother insisting that I should go back because he insisted that he was not very injured - seriously injured.  And I decided to go back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a> Then I saw a young boy who told me that all the people that had been shot, had died.  And he said my husband had been hit on the head and I was unhappy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You can take your time Ms Zenzisi, we can wait for you whilst you are trying to compose yourself.  Ms Zenzisi, are you now ready to continue?  I would like to ask, by the way, are there any incidents that had occurred at the time, what was the situation here in Duncan Village during this period of your husband's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> It was very bad at the time in 1985.  Even those who survived cannot tell how they managed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are there perhaps any certain incidents that you still recall which happened at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> What happened is, there was a problem with the school children.  They had their grievances and their needs and even the community had a problem with the Councillors.</p>

<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> At the time of the funeral nothing actually happened.  We just buried my husband, though there were some policemen and some soldiers around.</p>

<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Ms Zenzisi, I would like to ask you another short question.  Why was your husband shot?  Do you perhaps have any reason or any knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> I really don't know because I last saw him when he was going to a shop to buy cooldrink, and then the next thing I heard that he had been shot dead.</p>

<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> I wouldn't know whether he was an activist at the time, but on this particular day he had just gone out to buy cooldrink.  But I wouldn't tell anything about his activities.</p>

<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS ZENZISI:</span> No, this was not a normal occurrence.  This had just started.  It started on a particular Sunday and there was just wild shooting, even if people had just gone out to the toilet, they would be shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you.  We thank you Ms Zenzisi,  Mr Sandi we are now going to ask Ms Mxoli.  I would like to greet you Ms Mxoli at this morning.  Are you in the (indistinct).  Firstly, I would like to make sure in short, that all this I've got here is right.

Whilst we were still sitting at home I was still looking at my other son, because he was restless - he used to go out</p>

<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> We went there with my children and while we were there, they told us he was dead.  We came back and when we approached Ntsolo, we met a car and this car took us and there were people who had thrown stones to this car.  (tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> (tape continues) ....  who were in the soldiers' car?</p>

<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> We came home and on Wednesday - and on Thursday my other son came from Johannesburg and on Thursday morning three boys came towards my house and they were passing, and they were running, they were followed by soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a> And the soldiers came to my house and asked us who are these people and my son told them that I don't know who are they.  And the soldiers asked why don't you know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The Speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> My son told them Kinq told them to shoot me because they shot our son, but they didn't respond, they just went on and they left us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> All this was happening before the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Can you please repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> All this was happening before the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Yes, the soldiers came and they chased these three boys before the funeral.</p>

<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any other activities which were happening in the township where your son was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Yes, there were many activities happening.  It was difficult to go out and fetch water, because they were shooting teargas towards us.  My son was sick, he had a chest problem, he was always hospitalised and that soldiers used to shoot us with teargas on our way to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any other things which were done by soldiers when they met people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Yes, the soldiers did many things at those times.  While you were on your way you were always praying because you didn't know what was going to happen to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In other words, Ms Suthu, Ms Mxoli, together with Ms Zenzisi who talked before you, was it a miracle that other people were not shot during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> I wouldn't say because there are casualties which happened at that time.  The soldiers caused many problems and many people were injured at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you go to any lawyers, Ms Mxoli concerning this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Can you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you go to any lawyers for advice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any people who were arrested because of this shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you please tell us Ms Mxoli, how this shooting - what this shooting did to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> It injured me very much.  I am still in pain - even now because I don't know what was the reason for my son's death.</p>

<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> She is by my daughter here in Ntanzani and my daughter has got a baby now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Can you please tell us Ms Mxoli, what is your request in front of this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> My request is that I need assistance.  I need to</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>be helped with this child because I am unable to support this child at this present moment. </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Is that all that you want to say Ms Mxoli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Yes, there is nothing more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Ms Mxoli.  I would give this opportunity to this Chairman, thank you.</p>

I want to ask you about a statement you made when you said that you went to the hospital and the child that was with you was affected by the teargas that was constantly being thrown, is that the same child  Nothozayo or is it another child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Which one, I can't - I don't understand your question.  No, it is not, this was a child, this was a child who belonged to Kinq, not mine.</p>

<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> No, he had just been discharged from hospital because he was ill and he was on his way to Mtansani.</p>

<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MS MXOLI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> We are now going to ask Ms Ngcaka to come forward.  Let me thank you Ms Ngcaka for your presence here today to explain to us what happened to your son.  By the way what was your son's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> His name was Thembekile Ngcaka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Who shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> I was in King William's Town and Thembekile was here in Duncan Village so my father came to inform me that my son had been shot and he was in hospital.  I was shocked and I thought he was dead.  I then immediately went to hospital and I saw my son admitted in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a> And he had been shot on his tummy and I used to visit him in hospital and until he was discharged, one of the nursing sisters said they did not see anything in his tummy so he had an operation from the diaphragm down to the abdomen.   So he was discharged and I took him to King William's Town.</p>

<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>13 N NGCAKA</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a> And whilst we were there he couldn't eat properly and I didn't know what was wrong with him and I had forgotten that he had been shot.  When it is hot, he used to feel very sick and we didn't have money to send him to the Doctor, so one other day he went with my mother and my mother came with the report that he had taken ill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a> And he would feel thirsty and I had the impression that he healed completely, but I wasn't satisfied with his state of health.  But I did not bother myself much about taking him to Doctors, so he fell ill until I was perturbed and I decided to take him to a Doctor who diagnosed that his tummy was swollen so I took him to the Grey Hospital in King William's Town and I was told that he had been referred to Frere Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a> I could not make a follow up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I noticed that your child at the time you are shot was very young.  How old was he at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> He was 8 years old at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you perhaps go to any lawyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> No, no, no one went to any lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You did not go to any lawyer to seek advice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> No, we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Are there any people who were eye witnesses at the time this child was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> My brother was there, because I am talking about hearsay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you tell us what your brother said to you?  He said your brother was playing with other children at Douglas Smith highway.</p>

<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> Yes, my brother said all the children were playing behind our home and they heard some gunshots, because ultimately all of them were shot, though he tried to run away and he was shot on the tummy and he fell and my brother picked him up and took him to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your statement you said these children was shot by the soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> Yes, but my brother said my son was shot by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> So how were you affected by the death of your child who was very young at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> Since 1986, I have not been enjoying good health.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> How is your health at this present moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> I had a heart condition.  My husband too is suffering from high blood pressure because this really affected us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In your statement you have made mention of you have requests to this Commission that you need to know who actually shot your child together with his playmates, is it like that?  You want to know who shot your child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> Yes, I do want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you perhaps have any other requests to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> No, I cannot answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> In other words do you have any other thing to say in addition to what is in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGCAKA:</span> What I would like to say is that I was really hurt by the death of my child.  Says that I wish that he had died at the time they shot him.  I was really hurt that he still lived and he suffered the way he suffered and he could DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> I now will hand over to the Chairperson.  If you still have any additional information you are welcome to say it once more.  Over to you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Any question?  There are no other questions.  I wish to thank the three of you Ms Zenzisi, Ms Mxoli and Ms Ngcaka.  I thank you for giving a full picture to this Commission of this painful incident and the manner in which your relatives were killed and according to your statements you say they were killed by soldiers and the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a> We thank you for giving us this full picture because it is the aim of this Commission that we should call before this Commission the head of the police as well as the heads of the soldiers to give their side of the story so if we have incidents of this nature, we are going to present them before them and to find out from them what actually happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a> We thank you for the contribution that your relatives have made and also the struggle that the people of Duncan Village participated in which has made Duncan Village to be well known in the whole of the Republic of South Africa because of its contribution to the struggle, fighting of the human rights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a> We also listened to your requests as presented before this Commission with the hope that this Commission is going to look into them.  I would also like to explain that this Commission at this - at the point it will have to give its report to the President of this country and it will be the President and his Cabinet that will make the decision as </p>

<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>16</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>what to be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a> I am certain that the death of your relatives and then there is no compensation thereafter, will not be acceptable in the whole of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a> We therefore hope that, according to the conditions and the proposals of this Commission there will be perhaps something that will be done here in Duncan Village which will serve as a commemoration to the people of Duncan Village on behalf of  those who gave their lives during the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a> So it is important that you should give your request to this Commission and the Commission will forward them to the President.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a> We thank all of you for coming forward to this Commission and all you have said to us will be taken note of and will be forwarded to the President.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a> You can now go back to your seats, thank you. </p>
