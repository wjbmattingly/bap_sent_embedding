The only Doctor who was available at the time would just simply ask you whether you were a soccer player and if you would say you were not a soccer player, he would just say go and play soccer.  \n Then if you said you were a soccer player, he would say now relax for a week, so there was no medical treatment.\n Such that today I am very nervous.  I remember one other day when I was extremely nervous and we were in a cell, we were quite a big number locked in a cell - we could not even see each other.  The cells were just full and packed.\n And I could not get medical treatment at the time.  This Doctor gave me some pills that I can never forget, because as soon as I took them, I slept till morning and when I wanted to wake up, my whole body became very numb.\n I couldn't even shake my limbs and I had to lie down there.\n So that was the only treatment I got from this Doctor.
