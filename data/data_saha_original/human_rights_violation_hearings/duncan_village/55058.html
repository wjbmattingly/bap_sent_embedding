Two boys came, two or three boys came to my house to ask for petrol.  One of them said that he can open the car and take the petrol out and then  my wife told them that they can't because the cars had a safe and one of them stopped and one wanted to open the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did they get petrol from this cars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> No, he didn't.  I just told him that in this township my house isn't going to be burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You said, Mr Bottoman, on that night how did you sleep after hearing that you were going to be burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Since they said that we didn't sleep well.  We went to bed with our clothes, because we were waiting for anything that could happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> You say you slept with your clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Yes, I slept with my suit and a jacket on top of the suit and I slept with those clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>6 MW BOTTOMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mr Bottoman, you said you brought this matter to</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>the political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did you get any answers from the political organisations at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> I didn't get any straight answers, but they said they will look at this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> On that day your house was burnt, did you call the police or the fire brigade to help?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> When these boys ran away, I took the telephone and I phoned the police and I was told that there were no police and then I was just told that they will send the SADF to come and look at what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Did the soldiers come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> No, they didn't come while the house was burning, but they came afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> What did they say when they came?  I will wait for you Mr Bottoman until you are ready to continue because I want this to be clear.  Can you continue Mr Bottoman?  In short, without talking about details when the soldiers arrived at your home, they wanted to know the owner of the house which was burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> They also wanted to know where is the owner working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Do you have anything to say concerning the soldiers?  What did they say and how did they handle this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> What I saw is that they didn't care.  They were just asking - they were asking while they were on their DUNCAN VILLAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>7 MW BOTTOMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>car, they didn't get out of the car.  That showed me that they didn't care about this.  That is why I dropped this, I didn't go to the police station, but we just went to the hospital on the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Bottoman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Mr Bottoman, I would like to ask this question.  According to your views, what was the reason for the people to burn your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Apart from what was said on that day, people say that why should I have a big house and many cars, while others don't, that is what was, that is what people were saying around the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Did this happen only to you or were there any other people around Duncan Village which this happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Yes, other Councillors, their houses were also burnt and there was no connection between me and them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> As I was listening while you were answering the questions from Revd Xundu, was there any connection between these boys who were asking petrol from you and the burning of your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> Yes, I think so, because I didn't give them petrol and after that there were stories.  Because I said I needed this to be investigated, I told them to go to ask from the people in the township of what happened and the answer was that while I was asking to one of them who were there, while I was asking the political organisations, one of them said that I should go and apologise to the comrades - those I didn't give the petrol and I said that I was not going to do that and he said to me a car can hit a person while he is on a pavement, so my case is like that.  They</p>

<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>used that language to me, but I don't know where did he take this from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there any structures here in Duncan Village which were leading the struggle at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTTOMAN:</span> I wouldn't say so because they were not allowed at that time.  So I wouldn't say there were structures or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">REVD FINCA:</span> Thank you, Mr Bottoman and Mrs Bottoman for coming here in front of this Commission.  You would think that this is not important, but it is important to the Truth Commission for us to listen to the stories which you brought forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a> They give us a full picture and this wouldn't be clear if people didn't come forward.  We were given this opportunity as a Commission to draw a picture, a clear picture of what was happening at that time which the Parliament gave us to investigate.  We were also given this task to give a full picture of the bad and good things which happened during the struggle period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a> I think your story shows clearly the activities people took in the struggle, some are involved because in a way which they were not supposed to be involved.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a> And the aim of the Act promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation is to say to this nation, this is what has happened to this nation.  These are the things that were done to each other and for this nation to say "never again must these things ever happen."</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a> Thank you for coming here in front of this Commission to give us the picture you gave us and the request you gave to this Commission, we will look into your request and Revd </p>
