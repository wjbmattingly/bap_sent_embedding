            "Thank you Mr Chairperson.  My view is that all this conflict between myself and Mrs Tabalaza, when I got my taxi certificate - when my taxi, on my first day to use my taxi, a police came and they took out people from my taxi and they wanted to see my certificates and I showed them my taxi certificates.\n I said to them I have been transporting people for a long time without a certificate, why are you coming to ask me today.  They said that Mrs Tabalaza has sent her brother who was a police man that I was not supposed to transport people in that area, but we continued to transport people in that area.\n I saw, after a while people were not taking my taxi,\nthey were not using my taxi and I asked them why are you not using my taxi.  They told me that Mrs Tabalaza said that you are disturbing her in the business and even people go to  your shop to buy.\n I said to them the Government gave us facilities to work together, I don't know why you are being disturbed by what Mrs Tabalaza has told you.  My taxi was transporting people and after a while, in 1990 on the 17th if I am not mistaken, the Headmen's house was burnt down.\n The Headmen went to report because he did not understand all this.  The police promised to investigate.  When time goes on, up until the date when these houses were burnt down, the youth came and told us that there would be an organisation to be launched from Mount Fletcher.  \n I said to them they are going to inform me about the date and the venue, I don't remember the date, but they came and reported this to me and we went there.  \n Before we can even go inside the church, we heard some mothers like Mrs Nomachule saying that don't go in because you are going to be killed.  We went to Maluti together with the Headmen because the youth came to tell us that they were launching the organisation and we saw them leaving the church because it was said that they were going to be beaten.\n The police decided to come to see what was happening in the village.  They said that they may be late, the police came and they called us.  They told us to stay in the police station and we stayed there, we spent the night in the police station.\n In the morning we got a report that we went to burn Mrs Tabalaza's house and broke her windows.  The case went to\ncourt, there was no evidence in court because the police confirmed that we stayed with them the whole night, nothing happened.\n I was in court with her husband, she was accusing me of breaking her windows and the police confirmed that we spent the night together, nobody went out of that yard and the case was dismissed.\n We tried to find out from the youth why they were on Mrs Tabalaza's side because they came to us and told us that they were going to launch the organisation.  They said that Mrs Tabalaza said that her ANC is in Johannesburg and I was supposed to be burnt because I was a member of Inkatha.\n We took these reports to the police.  As time went on, some youths came to us to tell us that Mrs Tabalaza is talking about you all over because even your children are not allowed to come to the meetings because they are said to tell you the reports, Nozukobangeni and Tamsanqa Ntandazo.\n They gave evidence to court that - it was argued that they must go to my house to burn down my house because I was against Mrs Tabalaza.  One day I was sitting in my house, I saw these children going into Mr Sipika Zwelonke's shop and I saw Mr Sipika taking his car out to the village where I was born and my van, my bakkie was there to take my brother.\n Mr Sipika Zwelonke said to my brother in Bathurst, take your brother's car to the police because these children are going to burn it because my shop was also going to be burnt.\n And my van, my bakkie went to Mount Fletcher and to Maluti.  Mr Zwelonke Sipika's shop burnt down.  After that my shop also burnt down and my house, but people tried to stop fire in my house.\n The police arrived, there was chaos all over and their\nhouses were also burning down.",
