<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MANZALA DINGUMHLABA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mrs Manzala.  What is your clan name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> Manzala Dingumhlaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You have come here because your father was ill-treated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Will you tell us briefly.   Was this under the Nonqulana incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> Yes the boers came in the middle of the night, five men.   They detained him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> How long was he in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> One year and nine months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> And how was he health wise after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> He could not walk.  He said that it hurt around his waist.   He was in that state until he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> His health never improved to his original state?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> No, he could not even plough the fields as he used to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What is your request to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> Because I do not have a home, if the Commission could give me a home please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> These are the things that you have written in your statement.  Do you have anything to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> No I do not have another request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I just want to ask you a question.  Were there any endeavours to report the Government, because your people came back from detention in ill-health.  I do not know whether you understand me well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> I do not understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Members of your family were detained by the police.   On their release they were ill in many ways until such time that they died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> Did you try in any way to report the Government, the structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> No, we never tried to report the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> We were scared of being detained too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>We did not report the Government to any one, because there was no way.  We were petrified.   Even when we would see them walking, we thought that they were out to kill us.  Even when we had gone to town and we see the Government... In report they would tell us to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> It is only now in this room that we are able to report the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Manzala can you hear me? ....  I want this one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Manzala is a woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is it a woman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I am sorry I am wanting Mrs Manzala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a> I want to ask you a question, because in your statement you said something that has interested me deeply and I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>not only the Commission to hear this, I want the people that are listening to this across South Africa to hear it as well, because there is a need for them to hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a> May I quote from what you said in your statement about the perpetrators?  In your statement you said:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>"I wish that the perpetrators would ask for forgiveness and compensate me for the loss of my father and the humiliation that they caused."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> Yes I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is that still your wish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS DINGUMHLABA:</span> Yes, I want them to ask for forgiveness, because we are left as orphans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you very much.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>CHAIRMAN:   Thank you.</blockquote>
