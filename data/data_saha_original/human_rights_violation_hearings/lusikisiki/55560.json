I said that the last time I had seen him was when he had gone back to school.  He then asked if he had come back home at all.  I said no.  \n Then he came another time and asked for photographs.  He had a picture, his niece's picture.  I was wondering why he was showing me this picture.  He said that children don't do what they are supposed to do at school.  I did not know what he was talking about because as far as I knew my child was at school.\n He asked for his pictures, I went to get his pictures.  He - I said actually that we did have photo albums, I showed him the albums.  There was a picture that was vague, he was looking at the side, he then asked for this picture.\n I thought that perhaps he is going to use this picture.  He said he would bring it back, I have him two pictures.  He left with the pictures.  He never came back with the pictures to this day.\n After that, police would come at all sorts of hours asking for my sons, the one was in Johannesburg.  They asked when he was coming back, I said I did not know.  \n They would open my cupboards, throw my clothes on the floor, walk around.

I would like to know from you when they put forward their requests before the\nCommission, some request that as the children were buried in Maseru and there was a tombstone there to commemorate this children and their names were written on this tombstone, some say that the bodies should not be exhumed, because they were buried in a place where heroes were buried, but some other parents request that these bodies should be exhumed so that their children be buried in South Africa - maybe you can advise us.  \n I am not saying it would happen as you wish, but we would like to know what you think about these different views?

First of all, I would like to thank you because it is clear that these children sucked from heroes.\n You brought them up, they would not have wanted liberation such that they sacrificed their lives if they were not brought up by parents like you.\n The entire South Africa and foreign people were there to pay tribute, thanking these children, saluting them for the sacrifice that they made.\n The late Oliver Thambo also had risked his life and went to Lesotho, but he said that if these children had sacrificed their lives, then they were in just as much risk as he was putting himself in.\n This reflects that these children were precious to the organisation.  I know that it was not right that you were not able to go to the funeral, but please put your hearts at rest because a lot of people went there.  Their blood was shed to water the soil that planted the plants of liberation.\n Lesotho allowed us to make a heroes acre so that people know that we fought in the struggle and now are liberated.  Your children's names are documented in the history of this country, that is a monument.  Perhaps you can all go and put a wreath there.\n Please be strong, we thank you that you brought up these children such that they struggled for liberation.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.",
