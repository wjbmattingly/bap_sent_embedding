<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Reverend Xundu.  Thank you Ma'am, we are going to listen to you as you are going to give us a fuller picture of how our people were attacked in Maseru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a> We will ask Ntsiki Sandi to lead evidence on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Good morning to you.  We are going to start with Mrs Matandela.  As she had already said Chairperson - the Chairperson had already said that you are going to talk about your children that were shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a> Mrs Matandela, your child was Dumisani Macbeth Matandela, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How old was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> He was 22, because he was born in 1960.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Would you tell us briefly about his life before he went to Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> My son was at Msweshwe Secondary School.  When the schools reopened in June, he went back to school as usual.  That is the last time I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> A while after that a policeman came asking me where my son was.  I said that he is at school.  He then asked when last I saw him.  I said that the last time I had seen him was when he had gone back to school.  He then asked if he had come back home at all.  I said no.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> Then he came another time and asked for photographs.  He had a picture, his niece's picture.  I was wondering why he was showing me this picture.  He said that children don't do what they are supposed to do at school.  I did not know what he was talking about because as far as I knew my child was at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> He asked for his pictures, I went to get his pictures.  He - I said actually that we did have photo albums, I showed him the albums.  There was a picture that was vague, he was looking at the side, he then asked for this picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a> I thought that perhaps he is going to use this picture.  He said he would bring it back, I have him two pictures.  He left with the pictures.  He never came back with the pictures to this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a> After that, police would come at all sorts of hours asking for my sons, the one was in Johannesburg.  They asked when he was coming back, I said I did not know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a> They would open my cupboards, throw my clothes on the floor, walk around.  They would leave without having said what they wanted from me.  In December Mrs  Mgqwala came to me house with Mrs Mhlavuli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How were you related to Mrs Mgqwala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> She was just a neighbour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You say it was she and Mrs Khanyisile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes, they then told me that they got a report telephonically saying that my son was passed away.  I was very confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a> They then reiterated that Dumisani had passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was Dumisani one of the victims that had been shot in Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you able to go to Maseru as a family to the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> We were not allowed to go to the funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you make a request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes, we went to the police to request permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How did you feel that you could not even bury your child who was shot dead in a foreign land?  How did you feel that as a family, you could not see him for the last time and bury him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Well, we were not allowed.  We did not have passes, we were simply not permitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How did you feel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> We did not appreciate that, it was terrible.  To this day, we have not been to his grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> According to your statement here, you have made requests first you say, these people, the perpetrators, they should come forward and ask at least for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a> Could you elaborate please so that it is clear what it is that you are requesting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> We want to know who the perpetrators are because we are not satisfied with just a report that says that he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who is Vuyo Matandela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> That is his son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How old was he when his father was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Vuyo was four months old, because he was born in July, 27.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said you have a request in connection with Vuyo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes, I do.  I am not working, I am unemployed.  I cannot support him, I live on pension.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is there another request that you perhaps remember as you gave a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a> Are you getting a pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes, I get a pension from old age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all the requests that you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> We never went to Lesotho to see the grave.  If my child's body could be exhumed and be buried back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you go ask for advice, to an attorney perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> No, we did not go to an attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mrs Matandela, is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mrs Matandela.  Mrs Bungane, you say that your son - what was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> Mbuso Mzwandile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How old was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> He was 19 years of age, he was born in 1963.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When did he leave for Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> He left when the schools were going to reopen, it was in 1982.  I can't remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they leave together with Dumisani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When he was in Maseru, before he was shot, had they written to you or phoned you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.  The witnesses mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did this young man write to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> He wrote a letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he write a letter home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> He wrote to me, he was asking for money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Are there things that he mentioned in the letter referring to his life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> No.  He just said that they might have to go overseas to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What standard was he doing at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> He was in Matric.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you able to go to the funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> I did not go  because I was expecting them - I was expecting their bodies to be sent home.  My brother went, he travelled from Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you have a legal representative or perhaps did the organisation try to help you to bring the children's bodies this side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> We did not have a legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was it your wish to go to Maseru to bury your own child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You did not get permission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> I did not request that I be permitted to go to Maseru, I simply requested that my child's body be brought home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a> They however, refused.  They said that the ANC could not come this side to bury our children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Before your son left, were there problems, conflict perhaps with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> Yes, well the police would come to my house all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Therefor the police were quite oppressive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> They did nothing to me really, they would just ask questions.  The following week they would go to somebody else, otherwise they never really oppressed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you remember the requests that you made to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> I have children, I am unemployed, and I do not get a pension.  My husband passed away quite a while back.  It is difficult for me to live day to day.  I had requests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> According to this statement, you say that you would like to know who the perpetrators are.  Do you have particular reasons for wanting to know who the perpetrators are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> I just want to know the truth because it was very painful.  Even - I would like to know them, but there is nothing I can do really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You heard Mrs Matandela say that these people should come forward, the perpetrators, and ask for forgiveness to the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> I hears her saying that today.  We don't live in the same area.  Yes, I heard her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What do you think about that request that the perpetrators should come forward asking for forgiveness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> It should be so so that we can have peace in our hearts.   They must ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You made a request about children that are at school - who are these children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> Yolanda Bungane and Anene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> ; Are these your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> They are my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all you have to say Ma'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> Yes.  We would like to see where our children are buried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mrs Bungane, I will hand over to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to ask a question to both of you Mrs Matandela and Mrs Bungane.  Mrs Matandela, in our work with the Commission, we meet a lot of - quite a few parents whose children died in Maseru.  I would like to know from you when they put forward their requests before the</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>Commission, some request that as the children were buried in Maseru and there was a tombstone there to commemorate this children and their names were written on this tombstone, some say that the bodies should not be exhumed, because they were buried in a place where heroes were buried, but some other parents request that these bodies should be exhumed so that their children be buried in South Africa - maybe you can advise us.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a> I am not saying it would happen as you wish, but we would like to know what you think about these different views?  I am not sure whether my question is clear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATANDELA:</span> Yes, we understand.  Can I answer first please?  Personally, my view is that they should be exhumed and our heroes should be buried in South Africa, not in a foreign land.  Because when they are buried in Lesotho, it is like they are thrown away, but when they are buried in South Africa, it doesn't matter where they are, we will have peace in our hearts, because at least they will be in our land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BUNGANE:</span> That is a heavy question that you have asked sir.  I am not quite sure whether my wish is correct.  I would ... (tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It is something that is heavy indeed, Ma'am, you do not have to give an answer now.  Clearly Mrs Matandela has thought about this.  Maybe the Commission can try such that there is a meeting with all the parents because of they exhumed, they should all be exhumed, if things are going to be left as they are, all the children will be left as they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a> Reverend Xundu who was at the funeral at Maseru, would like to thank you on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  First of all, I would like to thank you because it is clear that these children sucked from heroes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a> You brought them up, they would not have wanted liberation such that they sacrificed their lives if they were not brought up by parents like you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a> The entire South Africa and foreign people were there to pay tribute, thanking these children, saluting them for the sacrifice that they made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a> The late Oliver Thambo also had risked his life and went to Lesotho, but he said that if these children had sacrificed their lives, then they were in just as much risk as he was putting himself in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a> This reflects that these children were precious to the organisation.  I know that it was not right that you were not able to go to the funeral, but please put your hearts at rest because a lot of people went there.  Their blood was shed to water the soil that planted the plants of liberation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a> Lesotho allowed us to make a heroes acre so that people know that we fought in the struggle and now are liberated.  Your children's names are documented in the history of this country, that is a monument.  Perhaps you can all go and put a wreath there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a> Please be strong, we thank you that you brought up these children such that they struggled for liberation.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may step down.</p>
