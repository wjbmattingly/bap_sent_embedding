            "At Mangwo, I was the first woman to start the work of transporting people.  I got a bakkie and a kombi.  I had to go to Johannesburg because I had an eyesight problem.\n When I came back from Johannesburg, it was on Tuesday, it was in March.  When I got home, I realised that the\nchildren of the village were members of the ANC, the youth.  There was a date set for a meeting to call visitors who were going to tell them what the ANC is all about.  On the 17th of March on a Saturday, I was going to go to Mzamba.  I came back on the Sunday, the day the meeting was going to take place.  It was going to be a youth meeting.\n That morning there was a group of comrades, Zihle Twala was a part of that group, they were coming to my shop.  When they got there, I - when I looked at them in the eye, I could see that they were not happy. \n They said that, they requested that I give them cold drink.  This cold drink they were going to give to the members of the ANC that was going to inform the youth of the ANC.  They took a litre of cold drink, they said they wanted to talk to me, I went to them.\n Zihle then said to me that they have come to tell me that they put me in trouble.  I asked him what kind of trouble, he said that they did not sleep the previous night, they were tortured, taken from their homes by  Kekeni Ndleleni, Christopher Sipika, Zwelonke  Sipika, Revd Mlandi.  They took them from their own homes as comrades.  They took me Zihle said to a small room where Zwelonke Sipika worked.  They closed me into the small room and they said to me that at the meeting that was going to be at the hall the next day on the 18th of March, when the people are there, Zihle must address the people at the meeting.\n Zihle then said they must burn down Kekeni's second floor of the building.  She then refused, she was threatened with guns, swords and axes.  They said that if Zihle is not going to say this about Nombuyiselo, that is myself, then they are going to kill me and my parents won't know what\nhappened to me.\n So to save my life, Zihle said she agreed that she would address the meeting.  I went to my colleagues, she said that she went to my colleagues and my colleagues then said that she must come and tell me, so I said that I must go to the police and tell them what happened so that after the meeting occurs, it is clear what they have done to her.\n I went to Maluti, there were two police.  The police said that is was just the two of them, therefor they could not go to the meeting, because there would be no policemen left at the station.\n We came back with the Lieutenant.  When I got to the village, I realised that the children in that meeting, the youth that is, some of them were on the Mpolele mountain.  The atmosphere was very oppressive at the village, very heavy and then I saw another group walking down the road.\n I asked what was happening, the youth said that the men in the villages were chasing them, therefor they are going to sleep in the forrest, because they were told that the men of the village were going to kill them.\n I said that they could not sleep in the forrest.  They said that they've already been beaten up, they have been chased out of the area, if they had to sleep at home, they were not safe.\n They then decided to go and sleep at the Headmen's place, Dumor Lipinda, who is my brother.  The leaders of the Youth League, ANC Youth League, were the ones who were mostly chased.",

I went out to see what was going on, it was full moon, I could see reflections.  \n These people were coughing, some smoking, I asked what they wanted in my house, why they were surrounding my house.  There was no answer.  In stead men emanated from a corner next to the gate, I peeped through the window, I saw Kekeni Ndleleni with other men.\n The Headmen Mfele was there as well.  I saw them.  I then said I was shocked that the Headmen was there.  They came closer to my yard.  They broke down my windows, kicked my door open.  Some of the men that were around the house, when I asked what they wanted, the answer was they did not want me, they wanted my children.  They wanted the youth.\n Then they shot wheels of my car, I heard a voice from outside and somebody said, screaming what is happening.  I then said, there are men surrounding my house, they have come to kill me.\n And this person who wanted to know what was happening, I could sense that these men were approaching this person, I heard murmurs, I could not even go outside to see what was happening to this person.  I found out the next morning that it was Mlungisi who was one of the comrades who was taken by the men to the police.\n There was a huge truck there with - he had other men.  I don't know where these men came from.  Mlungisi was ill-treated and beaten up as a comrade.  They said that they did not want toyi-toyi in the village.  He perhaps can clarify and say who it is exactly who beat him up.",

            "After that.  I am just jumping over some issues after that - on the 29th.  It was in the afternoon, the sun was still out.  I was going to a funeral, my cousin's funeral, he was shot in Johannesburg.\n I was going to take a stove that was going to help at the funeral.  There was chaos in the village.  Children were being chased.  I saw Christopher Sipika's van being driven very fast, I could see that something was happening.\n And I heard Kekeni calling out, because we are neighbours, he said that Nombuyiselo, today I am going to kill you.  I did not take that seriously because I was not a member of the Youth League.  I just took my stove and everything that I needed, put in the car and went home.  I came back - when I got at home, I realised that the youth had a meeting in that afternoon.\n They then went to Ngosi's place  where they continued with their meeting.  They concluded that they are going to be vigilant and see who is going to burn down people's houses that night.  This is when Ngosi said to them, because there was a high fence at Zihle Twala's house, then they should go there, stay inside and stay there overnight.\n I stayed at home that evening.  When I was sleeping in the middle of the night, I heard a noise.  I opened the door and peeped at Eunice Ndaba's house, who is sitting next to me, while the house was being burnt down.  I saw a huge fire.\n I heard these children toyi-toying over, surrounding Eunice's house.  They said that they saw Kekeni burning down people's houses that day, they were going to get him, he was\ngoing to shit on himself.  He then answered back in saying that they too are going to shit on themselves.\n These children then stood still around the house and people came to see what was going on.  Then the same youth went to Mrs Ndaba's house.  They were chased and went to Ndleleni's house.\n In the morning when I went, was going to work, as I left home, I was going to go past Ndleleni's house - my car was being stoned.  I saw these children going up the road.  As I drove, I heard a noise, I stopped the car and I looked around, I could see Kekeni with two children that worked for him, they went to my yard.  He broke my window, I don't know what he poured inside and they went around the house.\n What made me run is that I saw smoke and fire from my own home.  I got into my car and went to my brother and I told him that Kekeni has burnt my house down.  My brother said that we must go to the police station at Maluti.\n We reported this matter.  When we got there, we were told that the police had already left, because Kekeni had already gone to the police asking for help.  When I got back, I realised that a lot of houses had been burnt down, the police were there.\n The children that had been trying to put out the fire, had run away.  When I got to the bus stop, my brother who was a Warrant Officer at Matatiele, had come with other Boers who were from Matatiele, they wanted to examine the damage.  Kekeni was the one who pointed out to the police who should be arrested, he even pointed out my own driver.\n I was taken to Maluti, we stayed in jail for four days, eating porridge with paraffin.  During those four days my nephew whose father is a Warrant Officer in Matatiele came\nto Gumenta who was also a Warrant Officer.  He asked him why my aunt was arrested or in detention.\n Gumenta then called us, saying that they investigated and we were free because we were not guilty.  By that time most members of the Youth League were detained.  I realised that I should go to Umtata where I got Mr Madigi Zwela who phoned Maluti police station and gave an order that the children should be released, then the children were released.",

            "I would like to give the background of all this.  When Nelson Mandela was released, the youth in our area and other areas were going to Matatiele, because we wanted to celebrate the release of Mr Mandela.  Mrs Nombuyiselo's driver had a great responsibility to transport people to that venue, where we were going to celebrate the release of Mr Mandela.\n When we came back, we heard that in Mount Fletcher, there is going to be a rally, an ANC rally the weekend after.    Our children decided to go to Mount Fletcher, because they wanted to learn how things were done and they wanted to invite people to come and address them as 18 march was the day where ANC was going to be launched in our area.\n They asked this driver to take them to Mount Fletcher and he agreed.  He took them to the rally at Mount Fletcher.  When they arrived there, ANC flags were sold and they asked him to buy them these flags because they did not have money.  They said that they would repay him after they had collected some money.\n They said that their aim for buying a flag on the 18th, when they are launching ANC, they would already have a flag.  He bought this flag for them.  When they came back from the meeting, they came with this flag.  On the 17th, as Mrs Nombuyiselo has already said, Zihle was asked who bought this flag for them and he told them who did that.\n They asked him why he didn't ask them to buy flags, this flag for them and he couldn't answer, he couldn't answer them, because they asked the driver to buy the flag because he was there at the rally.\n And they said that they were supporting ANC and if they wanted anything else, they must come to them and ask and in my case, when my house was burnt down, on the 30th.  On the 29th, it was on the 30th when mrs Nombuyiselo's house was burning down, I was going to school.  When I saw this, I went to the police station in Matatiele where I met Mr Vuyo Lupindo who was in the police station in Matatiele.\n He together with another White policeman were sent to that house to observe what was happening.  I went to Maluti and while I was still waiting there, Mrs Zokwe together with Busisiwe came and they were going to report the death of their father and I was still looking at this matter, they told me that even my house was burning down.  I was so scared, because I was thinking of my children because they were in my brother's funeral who died in Johannesburg.  I did not know what to do.\n We came back there and we were all worried, we were scared.  When I arrived there, my house was flat, it was already burnt down and there was nothing I could do.  The police were all over my yard.  When I decided to go and look at this house, there was one girl, Nombulelo Sipika, it was the first time I saw her, she pointed at me and she said that I am the one who burnt down people's houses.\n I did not know what to say because I was arriving at that time and I couldn't understand why she said that I am the one who was burning houses and people came to try and help me and this girl said, I don't know how she could be a\nteacher.\n I looked at this girl because it was the first time that I saw her.
