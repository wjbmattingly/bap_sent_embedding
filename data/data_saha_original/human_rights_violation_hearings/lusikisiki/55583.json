It is sad that they did not come, so that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission could listen to their evidence.   There is nothing that we can do, however, because they are not here, but I want them to know that it is sad that they did not come.\n The last people that we are going to listen to is the following.

They shot people who were marching and they shot people who were not involved in that march.\n This means that you have the same story.  Maybe there is no need for each and everyone of you to explain the whole story, but on Sunday when we met, you elected certain people amongst you to represent you to lead the evidence on your behalf.\n You said that it would be Livingstone Siphelo Sapo and Simlindile Mabena.   The two of you, can you please come nearer to the microphone. I would like to clarify one matter.  If I remember clearly it is Mandlenkosi Tambodala in stead of Simlindile Mabena.\n Sapo and Mabena were leading the march at the time of this incident.  Tambodala was at the back of the march and he would give us evidence concerning that issue.\n Let us start with Mr Sapo and I would like you not to dwell on the boycott or the complaints about the workers, to save time.",

            "There is something I want to clarify if the Commission allows me.  This incident I can divide it into three.\n Firstly, it was on the 2nd December 1989. After the march one of our comrades whose name is Fikile Philip was run over by a police van in town, in Lusikisiki.  This is the first incident.\n We had a march on that day because three of our comrades were detained and I would like to mention their names.  It was comrade Nqokana, comrade Tombuzo and comrade Ngubane.   They were detained for a week and they did not appear in the court of law.  We visited the Chief Magistrate frequently because we wanted them to be in a court of law and in the second week the Chief Magistrate ordered the police to bring them to court and their was no charge laid against them.  This case was transferred to Qogeni to our Paramount Chief, Tnadizile.   It is where \nthis matter was resolved.\n Before they were released, while they were still inside, on the 2nd of December 1989 there was a march while they were still inside.  It is when Fikile was run over by a police van.\n On the 6 of December we visited the Chief Magistrate to request permission for the march for the 7th of December.  He told us that he wanted to contact the Station Commander of Lusikisiki first, who was Maj Mjobo.    He contacted him on the phone and he responded that he refused permission for this march.  We were forced to have this march on the 7th and it is where the problems started.\n We were waiting for our lawyers, Sangoni and Partnership from Umtata, but at that time they were not there.  Whilst we were still waiting for them the police came together with the Station Commander, Mr Mjobo and Mr Zwilithle Qezo, who was the Station Commander from Thlabalovu.   They came together with the police who were armed and they had sjamboks with them.\n When the Station Commander arrived Mr Mjobo said that, I want you to show me a document to state that you have the right to be here and he said that if you do not have such document, you have to disperse within five minutes.\n After one minute he ordered the police to shoot.  Everybody was beaten up, everyone who was in town, in Lusikisiki.   Some of us took a line to Manthlayeni and they did not go home, because they were scared.  Those who were supposed to go to Port St Johns and Mambodi came to our area.  They did not go to their homes.\n It is on this day that comrade Tjetje got injured.  He was coming from a doctor and he was beaten up while he was standing there, waiting for transport.   The police came and they beat him up.  One of the police was Tamsaqa Ntanjana.  He was using a van which belonged to Malele.\n What I am trying to say is that this was the second incident.\n A third one which is why we are here today.  It was on the 20th of December 1989.   It was on a Thursday... it was on a Wednesday, sorry.\n We could not go to a public hall because there was a church gathering.  We forced to go to the tennis court.  While we were still waiting there ...  We were not going to gather there as such but we wanted to go out and pick shops because on the 20th, 67 workers were dismissed without a reason.\n There were pamphlets distributed on the 19th.  We started in town and we were in a bus and we came through to Gotzo with a bus, distributing these pamphlets, but in the morning we found out that the police collected all the pamphlets during the night.",

If we were gathering in a hall maybe we would not have been beaten up.  We used to gather outside because we do not have a community hall.\n I would request the Commission to help us to have a community hall.
