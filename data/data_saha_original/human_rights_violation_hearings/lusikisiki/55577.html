<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">JONGINDLU THEOPHILUS NUBA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir you have heard the evidence.  Do you confirm this evidence or maybe you want to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR NUBA:</span> I confirm the evidence but I would like to emphasise the request concerning Nonqulana.  I felt bad when Ndlovu and Ngquza mountains were put before Nonqulana, because everything started at Nonqulana when the comrades were standing up against the tyrannical reign of the Government of the day.   The heroes of Pondoland went to meet at Nonqulana, standing up against an autocratic rule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> The root was Ngquza.  This is why I wanted to emphasise that history begins at Nonqulana.  This is how it can be complete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is Segilwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NUBA:</span> It is in Bizana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you for having helped to get a fuller picture of what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> Mr Sandi is going to thank you on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NUBA:</span> Pardon me.    I request that there be RDP services at Nonqulana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Even though you did not warn me that I am going to be thanking these people, therefore what I will</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>be saying will be truly from my heart, because I did not prepare anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> We thank all the witnesses that came before us as we have been endeavouring to look at the matter, the Ngquza incident.   The witnesses that came before us from yesterday to today, our efforts perhaps are something that is life to you but to us it is a part of history.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> In our historical documentation this incident is only reported, but now that we are here we realise how much it contributed to the political struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> I thank you on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may step down.</p>
