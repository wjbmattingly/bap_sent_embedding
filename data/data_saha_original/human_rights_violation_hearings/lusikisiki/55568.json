We are not going from mountain to mountain with the meetings that you had.  \n The evidence that you are aware, that you have already given is there something that you would like to add?  Perhaps each of you would get up and say that there is nothing new that I would like to add or there is something I would like to add.\n Do we understand each other?\n If there is something new to add please do not be shy, get up and tell us.
