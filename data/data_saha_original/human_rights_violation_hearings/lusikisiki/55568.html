<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">POYINDA MASOKISI NAGI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You were also a member of Congo in the 1960's and in your statement you were also present at the Ngquza incident but fortunately you were not killed and you were arrested in 1970. At the time of your arrest in 1970 why were you arrested at this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> We were arrested because the boers wanted to know, the people who crossed the border to Zambia.  These people were Diliza Ghandi and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> They wanted you to say that you helped them escape</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> Yes, they said that they escaped from my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened when you were arrested in 1970?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> When I was arrested I was taken by a police van.  I was together with my brother.  We were in different police vans.   In the morning I was taken to a tent and I was hand-cuffed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How long did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> I was hand-cuffed from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were you hanging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> Yes, I was left hanging and one boer, Truter from Pretoria would come and smoke and watch me and beat me.  He was beating me with a baton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> They came back at 5 p.m. and they released me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How long did you stay in prison, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> In Kambati, I stayed there for four months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In your statement you mentioned that you were arrested in Umgundlovo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> Yes, after they have beaten me up, the following morning they took a tube and placed it in my mouth, in my face.  One would come on my back and this tube would be in my face for a long time and they would kick me and I would fall down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> This woman's father, who is sitting here next to me, we were together in this prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> All this was happening in Kambati.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When did you go to Umgundlovo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> After these four months and I stayed there for six months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened in Umgundlovo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> They were not beating us up in Umgundlovo.  And the police would ask you if you had been beaten up before.  If you said no, they would send you in another cell.  If you said yes, they would send you in a different cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know why they were putting you in different cells?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> I think that they were putting us in different cells, because they did not want us to tell each other what question we had been asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you go to any court of law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> No, we did not go to any court of law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Sir, when you started talking you said that you were taken together with your brother.   What happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> He was arrested and he was sentenced for seven</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>years.  And he stayed in prison for two years and three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> For which charge was he sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> He was charged for helping people to escape and cross the border to Zambia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> His name is Mphanga Nagi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you make a statement on his behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you have a request to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> Yes I have a request to the Commission that we fought for this Government and we are still fighting for this Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In other words what would you like the Government to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> I would like the Government to build a monument for the Ngquza victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Sir.   Is that all you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> I also have a request to the Commission to build roads for us, because we cannot get to Ngquza, because of bad roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  I will hand over to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Poyinda can you hear me?   There is something I do not see in your statement.  Maybe you can clarify this matter.   When you were arrested in 1971 is this connected to the Ngquza incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> I was arrested after the incident, the Ngquza incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there any other people who were arrested in 1970 with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> Yes, Kathla Macani and others have passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the connection between your arrest in 1970 and the Ngquza incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> The police would come to our houses at night while we were sleeping and they would search for everything.  They would search everything in our houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were questioned in the prison were there any connection between the questioning and the Ngquza incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAGI:</span> They were asking where Dilisa is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may step down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a> And we now call Mavis Gazula, Bekabantu Qalanyobe, Nelson Jinineka, Mvelwa Chushelwa, Nconono Mabel Nondabula, Norma Kabishi Mbwana, Nokwanda Nora Mayidume, David Zifokofe Silangwe, Nelsie Mtutuse Mayidume.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a> I would like to swear you in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a> Mr Chairperson they have been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a> The evidence that we led yesterday was about the Ngquza incident.   We looked at this incident quite closely yesterday, in detail.  You were supposed to have testified yesterday, but because we had a problem with electricity we could not continue with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> What we needed to do yesterday is that some more evidence had to be given for a fuller picture.   This is what we are going to do.   We are not going from mountain to mountain with the meetings that you had.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a> The evidence that you are aware, that you have already given is there something that you would like to add?  Perhaps each of you would get up and say that there is nothing new that I would like to add or there is something I would like to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a> Do we understand each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a> If there is something new to add please do not be shy, get up and tell us.   Perhaps you would like to say that in all the evidence that has been given before the Commission there is something that has not been mentioned that I would like to mention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a> This is how we are going to conduct this matter.</p>
