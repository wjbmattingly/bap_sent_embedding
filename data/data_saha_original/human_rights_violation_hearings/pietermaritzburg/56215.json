Then we saw a crowd of people approaching us and they were chasing some youths, and those youths were believed to be members of the UDF.  They came towards us, and at that time the people who were chasing them were having assegais and pangas.  And our brothers were also included, were chased together with the group.  Then as they went further afield we just heard gunshots.  Then we ran towards that direction.  When we got there we realised that a youth from the family, Zondi family, had been shot dead.

            "  Nhlanhla and Zwelakhe had to run away from home, and they went to stay at Mthlizane. When they got there there was nobody there and they were staying all by themselves.  Ultimately they had to come back home.  As soon as we came back it all started again.  We just couldn't sleep.  Inkatha members used to come and we used to hide them underneath the beds, and we used to sit on top of them and hide them beneath so that they may not be seen by the enemies.  Each time that happened we used to hide them, and they used to come continuously.  We used to put them under the mattress space.  Each time they were looking for them we used to do that.  And at some stage they had to run away and stay at Gcaluza, where Ningi and Thenjizwa had also been staying.  They stayed there for quite some time.  We were not very comfortable at home because the Inkatha members used to visit us.  Then in September Inkatha people were recruiting people to join them.  They were speaking through a loudspeaker, and they kept on telling us that, \"Even you, Mzolo family, you must come and join us, because if you don't join us we are going to burn your houses.  You are busy supporting Mandela.\"  We were very confused, we didn't know what to do, and we asked ourselves as to what should be done in this situation.  We decided that we must join, but we were torn apart.  Others said, \"We can't join Inkatha,\" and we were in a state of confusion.  At home we were 42, so we were divided in between.  And now we didn't know what to do, because there were so many of us we couldn't get another place to stay, so we were forced to join Inkatha.  But they always used to come and see because they didn't believe in us as members of Inkatha.  On a particular day, that was on the 17th of November, it was on a Tuesday, it was round about 3 o'clock to half past three, Phuphu came to our place.  His surname is Ngubane.  He came running.  They had gone to attack the UDF members just below our place.  He came running to our place.  He told us that on that particular day they were coming to burn us because the youth of our place they didn't want to join the Inkatha.  Nobody answered him.  He went away.  We stayed and we were devising some means, we were thinking of some plans to combat this.  We decided to go and report this to the police.  We eventually reported this.  We phoned the  police.  The police told us that they would be coming.  We went back home.  Round about 6 o'clock to half past six people starting filling in the yard.  They came to attack us.  They burnt down three houses, including our house.  They started from one direction, and the others started on the opposite direction.  My sister, Nomonde, was inside the house.  Whoever got a chance to run away would run away, but Nomonde was left inside.  When she was making an attempt to escape she was actually accosted.  She had to go back into the house.  Each time she tried to get out her attempts were thwarted.  At the end of the day they said she must come out, because if she didn't come out they were going to burn her inside the house.  When she ultimately came out she was stabbed, but luckily she survived.  On the following day we were quite scattered. Each and every one of us was running into different directions.  We went to meet at Latha's place.  When we realised that there were some missing, my son Andile was missing, we ran into the road with my sister, Nomphumelelo, as well as my other sister.  We stood there at the street just looking around, trying to find out whether we could see my son.  We saw policemen and we asked them to give us a lift so that we can go around checking for my son.  They did give us a lift.  As soon as we got home we looked for my son.  We looked in the burnt house, but we just couldn't see Andile.  We went around the whole place.  We went to the neighbours' places to try and find out whether they had seen him, but we just couldn't get Andile so we went back without getting him.  We went to the police to report the matter.  The police went, as well as the mother of the child, they went to  Mhlongo's place, where it was believed Andile was taken",

If Mr Ndlela could please come up onto the stage.  For the benefit of those people who were not here yesterday, in his evidence yesterday Professor John Aitchison talked about this period of violence and unrest in Mpophomeni, and I will briefly just recap his evidence.\nThe local spark for conflict was the strike at the British tyre and rubber factory, Sarmcol in Howick, that started on the 30th April 1985.  The strike took place because of the company's refusal to recognise the trade union.  The entire African workforce was dismissed and a successful stay-away in Pietermaritzburg took place on 18th July 1985, and the stay-away was followed by a consumer boycott of white-owned shops in Pietermaritzburg.  The boycott was denounced by Inkatha, and this led to the bussing in, the sending in by buses of a 200-strong Inkatha group into Mpophomeni township, which is the home of the Sarmcol strikers.  This took place on the evening of 5th December 1986.  They abducted four COSATU officials and members in Mpophomeni township, assaulted them, and executed three of them, whilst one of them managed to escape.  The Inkatha group was then escorted out of the township by the police.  Within a day or two at least three of the perpetrators were arrested after a professional investigation by the Howick detective branch, but very soon after this their release was ordered by a high-ranking police officer, Security Police officer, in Pietermaritzburg.  An inquest into the deaths took place in March 1988, and nine Inkatha members were named as having been the perpetrators, yet they have still not been prosecuted.  \nToday we welcome one of the people who was residing in Mpophomeni township at that time, Mr Moses Ndlela, and he will give us some brief background as to that dispute.

Our employers accepted that MAWU will take stop orders from our salaries, and then later in 1985 we had grievances that we needed to send to our employers.  And then our employers didn't want to accept that we have those grievances, and they didn't want to pay attention to our needs, so we started showing them that we needed them to pay attention to our grievances.  We called unions, we tried to negotiate, and the employers didn't want to pay attention.  And then we decided that we're going to sit-in, we're going to embark on the sit-in, and then the employers decided to close the gates.  It was in 1985. Do you remember the month?   ---   No, I can't remember the month.  I am not sure whether it was May or April.  I am not quite sure.  I was very surprised the following morning when I went to work and they had actually made out a lock-out and people were locked outside.  I looked around because our firm is a little bit further down in the south, and then when I looked up I saw soldiers who were called.  They had guns and we were being watched over.  Then thereafter we were told that all those who had been working and getting their salaries over the week are now being chased away, they are being expelled.  They can go and get their money at Ndabazabantu.  And one of the leaders of the union came to address us.  He told us that we're not supposed to take any money, we were going to arrange means by which we were going to get our salaries because we were still at the negotiation stage.  From there we went back home.  So we made a resolution.  We said that we didn't want - it wasn't a fact of not wanting to work at the firm, but we had grievances that we needed to be addressed, so we wanted the firm to change its ways.  At ...

Let me just tell you what my relationship is with Bongani.  He is not my relative, he is quite a close friend.  In December we had run away from Haza because of being harassed by a certain political group.  We ran to a place that was next to Haza, probably five kilometres from Haza.  That's where we ran to.  It was an ANC region.  When we got there we were accepted.  They took us into a hall.  We had to find means of surviving.  I was running away with Bongani, because he was also being harassed and told that he was a member of the ANC.  At Mpophomeni we didn't know what to do because we were not working and we just had no means of earning a living.  Now I decided that I should get something to do.  I opened up a tuck shop.  I was selling fruits and vegetables.  Now one of our friends said he wanted to help me with transport so that we could order the goods that I was selling, and I would give him a nominal fee. ",

They were having assegais, pangas, and we heard even gunshots.  They were in a warpath.  It seems as if they were heading more towards the station, which is two kilometres from the place at which we were selling our vegetables.  I told Bongani that the business was bad that day because people were fighting.  We decided to close the shop because we didn't feel safe.  We packed our belongings.  It was round about half past nine.  We packed them into the car.  Now there was starting to be some unrest.  At that time there were police - there were little mini police stations that were just being put or erected at particular places, and we realised that these mini police stations had been put further up.  Along the way we met another man who was limping because he was injured.  He stopped us.  We know who the man is.  He stopped us.  He wanted us to help him, take him for medical attention, and we told him that we had a problem because we were trying to rush home also, so it was better for us to go home, unpack, leave all the goods at home, then we will take him to the clinic because he was limping.  We went home.  Along the way we went around meeting people who needed medical attention, who needed to be taken to the hospital.  Then we came back, we took him.  As we were driving there was another one who was badly injured who also requested us to help him also.  We took them to the Mpophomeni Clinic and we left them there.  When we left the clinic Bongani said to me we should avoid the other road, we should use the main road, because the place now was full of police and we were scared that they would do something to us.  We decided to use a different route.  I said to him we should definitely use a different route.  On that route that we used we saw other men who were also running away because now the police were shooting at random.  We drove for a little distance from the station.  We saw a police van.

They continued shooting at us, and you know when the boers start shooting they never stop.  They just continued shooting.  Bongani said to me, \"We are going to die now.\"  They shot the wheel or the tyre of the car and we got a puncture.  We lost control of the car.  It went out of the way.

Bongani said to me, \"Can you hear the Hippo coming just behind us?\"  He said we must try and pretend as if we were dead, because if we didn't pretend like that we were going to be killed.  We kept still and the Hippo stood just next to us.  There were three policemen.  There were two white and one black one.  They asked in Afrikaans, asking themselves whether we were dead.

Then this child said to me, \"Oh, you are the man who was with my father when he died.  Why did you allow the police to shoot my father?\"  This child is only six years old, but he asked me this question.  I could not answer him.  Even before I answered him he said to me why didn't I kill the policeman who had killed his father.  I was at a loss for words.  I did not know what to do.  He said, \"I hate the people who killed my father.\"  You can imagine a child of that age saying such strong words.  How is he going to grow up?  How is he going to cope?  He is of schoolgoing age now, but he hasn't yet been to school because the mother is not working.  Now they also want me to help, to lend a hand, to assist them with the child's education.

He came and he went to Bheki Maseko's house again, and in the evening the same day I heard gunshots, and I was scared because gun sound it's something that I really don't like, and I got scared.  I was inside my house and I said to one person who was with me, who was my son, I said to him, \"Hey, you know, when I am hearing gunshots I get scared because Bhunu is not in here.\"  I prepared meal and I dished out for my kids, but I couldn't eat myself because I wasn't okay.

Late at night - I can't remember very clearly what time it was, but I think it was round about 9 o'clock - we heard a knock at the window and I woked my husband.  I said, \"There's a knock.  Someone is knocking,\" and then when he wanted to go and open the door I said to him, \"No, don't open because I heard gunshots, so what if those people who were firing the gunshots are the ones who are knocking.\"  So the person who was knocking identified himself quickly, and my husband went and opened the door and talked to this person.  This person's name was Mr Gama.  So my husband came back and told me that Mr Gama had news for us.  \"He said he needed to take me somewhere to show me something because something has happened.\"  So they've driven by ND's car, and I just couldn't sleep afterwards.  I was uneasy.  I went to my other kid's bedroom, I told my kid, whose name is Sibongo.  I said, \"Your father went somewhere and they said there were bad news.\"  So I stayed afterwards at the dining-room because I was feeling uneasy, and after a while they came back.  And my husband opened the door and he came inside, and those other two guys who were with him were left outside.  And then when I asked my husband, \"How did you go?\" my husband said, \"Bheki and Bhunu are injured.\"  So I said, \"Where are they if they are injured?\"  So my husband kept quiet.  And after a while my husband said to me, \"Because you are dressed up let's go,\" and my husband said to me, \"Let's go, because Bheki had been injured and he's dead.\"  So I said to my husband, \"You know, please tell me.  If something had happened to Bhunu just tell me.\"  I could feel in my blood that something had been wrong.  (Pause)  ",

            "  I am not sure, but I will say 8 o'clock.  He left for a while up until 3 o'clock.  I heard gunfire.  One guy came to tell us that someone had shot my son at the bus stop or taxi rank.  And I was at home.  I felt like I am losing my mind, and I wanted to leave my house and run and go and see what was going on at the taxi rank.  I saw policemen whom we used to call them \"shayabhuka,\" and they were in green uniforms and they came.  And my wife and I we went there because we wanted to know more, because someone has also told us that other three people have been shot as well.  And when we arrived there my son was no longer there.  They have taken him.  They have taken him to a mortuary, and we were not there.  And they said when they arrived there my son wasn't there, but they just saw the blood, his blood.  The next morning one boer came to my house.  His name was van Vuuren.  He said to me, \"We found your son.  We've been looking for him for a long time, and you've been telling us he's not around, and you've been telling us he's working in town.\"  Because they have been looking for him, but I knew my son didn't commit any crime, but he was a leader of the Comrades.  And then I said to this white guy, \"Are you sure you found him?\" and this white guy said, \"Yes, we did.  Let's come and we will show you.\"  And they said to me, \"You must come tomorrow morning to us.  We will show you.\"  I said, \"Okay,\" and the next morning I went to the police station.  When I arrived there van Vuuren, this boer, said, \"You, we've been coming to your house looking for your son, and now we've found him.  Now I can cancel his case.\"  And I asked him, \"What did he do?\"  And then he said, \"No, your son, we've been hearing a lot about him.  We've been hearing that he's the hottest guy amongst the Comrades.\"  And when he was talking he was happy, and he said to me, \"They thought they were gun proof.  We found them now.\"  And they told me to come with them to their car.  They took me, they left with me.  I was quiet all along.  And then they came back with him.  And it was very cold, it was like it's snowing.  I went there with them because I wanted to see my son's body, and my heart was torn apart when I saw bodies, corpses, being packed on top of each other, and I said, \"How come I can't see my son?\" when I looked over.  Mr Mchunu, who was working with Dr Thomson -Dr Thomson who was the pathologist doing the post-mortem -I saw him on top of the table.  There was no space where you can put your feet because there were corpses all over the place.  And I looked around and my heart was torn apart, and I saw my son.  I looked at him.  I saw one big hole on his chest and I said to myself, \"Oh my God, my son is lying there forever.\"  My son told me that we should move from that place, and I said, \"No, I won't go back there because I might die.\"  And I said to myself, \"Oh, sleep well, my son.\"  Mchunu asked me, \"Where are you going to take your son?  Which mortuary are you going to take him to?\"  And I said to him, \"I don't know,\" because Mpumalanga Mortuary didn't want to take our bodies, and again I won't bury my son at Mpumalanga township.  Archie Gumede was the one who helped me to find a cemetery where I could bury my son, and this was at Clermont location.  Then we started preparing for the funeral now.  We prepared for the night vigil.  My wife was crying, because while we were waiting for the funeral service the white men used to come and search my wife, and she used to cry all the time.  ",

Thereafter Zakhele Nkehle made an oath and swore that we thought we were better people because we were ANC members.  Then he said I should bribe him in order to be able to stay peacefully at Hammarsdale.  I told him I wasn't able to do that.  In 1986 there was a split between our union, NTW, so we formed our own union called TAWU.  Unfortunately I was elected as the president.  That is when Zakhele Nkehle and Mr Sishi came to me and told me that if I didn't want to bribe him I was going to have a very difficult life in Hammarsdale.

She was working at Dalbridge, and she used to travel to and fro in the morning and come back in the evening.  There's a place called Three Line, and that place is an Inkatha stronghold, and when we wake up in the morning we never used to switch on the light so that people wouldn't realise that we were already awake.  So we lived that life where we were being raided day in and day out.  We reported the matter to the police station, but absolutely nothing was done.  The police just didn't care, and Smit showed some signs of siding with the Inkatha in Hammarsdale.  When we formed this union I told him that I wasn't going to bribe him, I wasn't going to offer him any money.  Then he told me in court - I told him in court that I wasn't going to bribe him.  Then in 1988, on the 25th of August, that is when my wife died.  She was shot along her way to the work.  We were very confused.  We didn't know who had killed her.  Up until now we didn't know.  It's only recently that we heard the matter.  She was working at a certain firm in Dalbridge.  It was a very small firm.  Now when the case was being heard in Makhutha that's when we discovered that my wife was killed - even today our family is split into two because there was always that question mark as to who killed my wife.  Now in 1989 we discovered that she was killed by the Inkatha gang, that is Musa Xulu.  That's only then that we discovered.  We were told by a certain man.  She was killed by Alexis Khumalo and Musa Xulu.   Musa Xulu is a KwaZulu-Natal Police.  He is in Umlazi, but he stays in Hammarsdale.  Khumalo is very well known.  He's the main witness in the KwaMakhutha case.  They were the ones who told us, and we even saw in the newspapers that she was shot because she was giving UDF arms.  Yes, they said my wife was giving arms to the UDF.  In reality they wanted to kill me and my son, but they just could not, so that's how they decided to kill my wife.  That's how she died.  She wasn't politically active.  She was the easy target for them to get.  In the end they decided to kill her.  That was to get at me.  They had to use her as a soft target.  I could not get a licence, because I also wanted to get a firearm to protect myself.  We applied to Adriaan Vlok, but we were refused licences.  They said we must apply to Kleynhans, but they could not give us any reasons why they didn't want to give me a firearm licence at that time.  Up until now I have never got a licence.",

They intimidated, harassed and shot people who opposed the previous Government, and we hope that with the advent of democracy and liberation that we have achieved that this is a thing of the past, although we still know that in many - in some parts of our country the police still have to undergo transformation and change in their attitudes towards people.

You could have thought that we had killed so many people in South Africa the way the boers were surrounding the Durban Station.  They had every type of dog and every type of gun you could ever see.  And we were only seven that were getting arrested.  We were taken and put into cars, brought back to 'Maritzburg.  When we got into Loop Street Police Station they started blowing their horns, and policemen started showing their faces right at the tops of the building.  They were making all these sorts of noises.  They were whistling, calling us bridesmaids and brides.  Our hands were tied as well as our feet.  We were being taken up right at the top of the building.  That's where we were separated, we were put into different rooms.  Each and every one of us had his own room.  That's where it started.  They asked me as to what had I gone to do in Durban.  I told them I had gone to visit my friend in Durban.  They said no, I was lying, I had plans of my own.  I flatly denied that.  That's when they started assaulting me.  They told me that I was going to tell them all the truth.  I was being kicked, assaulted.  At about 10 o'clock I told them - I admitted to them that I was actually a passer-by in Durban, I didn't plan to stay in Durban.  That's what I wanted to tell them, because there was absolutely nothing else that I could say.  I told them  that I was just a passer-by.  Then they said, \"Oh, you were a passer-by.\"  They asked me about the ones who left during 1975 as to their whereabouts, the ones who were at Sobantu.  I denied any knowledge of those people, and I denied ever knowing where they got to.  They told me I was lying and they continued assaulting me.  They undressed me.  They took gravel stones, they put them in my shoes.  They said to me I must wear these shoes, put my feet inside.  They tied the shoes so tightly.  They said I must skip or jump 100 times, and the stones were pricking my feet underneath.  I kept on hopping.  I was being assaulted with fists, especially in the stomach.  I was being told that I was going to tell the truth.  They took a towel, made it wet and tied it into a knot, and assaulted me with it on the face.  They said I was going to tell them the truth as it is.  I should tell them about the 1975 people.  I flatly denied knowledge of it.  They said to me, \"Oh, you don't want to talk.\"  They brought a rope, they tied it in my penis.  They took two very big books, they tied them in my penis.  They said if I fall they would hit me with the fist, and each time I was falling, losing balance, they kept on hitting me.  I just couldn't keep on standing with all those heavy things on me.  I ended up falling down.  They undressed me.  They took the towel, they blindfolded me with it.  They ... (incomplete - end of Side B, Tape 3) ... they were changing each other, giving each other a chance to assault me.  At about five in the morning they put me down.  that's when I lost consciousness.  When I regained consciousness I was in Mooi River.  I don't know how I got to Mooi River.  It was on a Monday when I regained my consciousness, and I remember losing consciousness on a Sunday morning.  I asked the policeman as to where I was.  He told me I was in Mooi River.  I asked him how I came to Mooi River.  He said to me when I arrived I was a corpse, I was dead.  When I was asking that I was flat on the floor, lying on the ground.  My whole body was aching because they were jumping on top of my body with boots, and my hands were tied so that I couldn't defend myself or fend off the attackers.  I stayed there in Mooi River.  I was eating porridge twice a day.  On Saturday I would get the porridge thrice.  Until I spoke the truth I would eat the porridge for three months, and I wouldn't wash.  I was going to drink water from a plate like a dog, and I would kneel down like a dog and crawl when I drink this water.  I had lice because I didn't wash.  I had one blanket to sleep.  I was put in a shack in Mooi River.  I was told that I was going to speak the truth.  If I wanted water  they told me that I wasn't going to get any water.  They gave me water in a plate, and when I finished drinking that water they would tell me that I would get my ration on another day.  At times I would drink rainwater, because there was a hole in this little cell and when water was dripping I would drink that water that dripped from the roof.  That was all I could get.",

Sometimes he used to tell me, \"I won't come and fetch you, you can take public transportation to work.\"  On the 25th I asked myself, \"How come he is not \"coming to fetch me, because it's my pay day and I want to go and do some grocery, and also deposit money for Nombulelo for the kids?\"  And then something told me to make a call, but then I decided to leave, and I told Bhumi that, \"If he comes you must tell him that I've already gone.\"  He was the kind of person who didn't like to spoil us.  Sometimes he would want us to take public transportation.  When I went home I stayed until it was late at night, and I went to bed.  I heard a noise which scared me.  When you are going to my house the route to my house it's not nice, and I heard two people screaming my name, my sister and my sister-in-law, and they called me by my son's name.  And I opened the door for them, and when I opened the door I just thought that, \"Oh, maybe something had happened.\"  I thought there was something happened to my mother-in-law.

Just shed some light on that person please.   ---   There's a person who was my husband's friend.  I know his name, but I don't want to mention his name because I want the investigators to do their job.  This person, who was my father's friend, went to stay in Umtata, where I was staying with my husband's children.  This man used to come every day at my place and ask me as to what Thobekile is saying about my husband's death.  I used to say to him there's nothing to say.  At times he would even wait when I had gone out.  And when I phoned my mother he would ask what was being said, and I would say nothing was said.  As he used to come almost every day at my place one particular day he told me that my patio door that had a couch in front o it, that won't ever be seen by any body that it was open.  He asked me whether I knew that my patio door was open.  I asked him how he saw it, because I knew that nobody would be able to come in because there is a certain manner in which we close the door, and a person who doesn't know my place wouldn't be able to open that door, or know that it's not closed.  That made me doubt, because probably there's something that he tried to do but he wasn't able.  And the third time this man came into the house it was at night.  It was round about nine.  I didn't see him with my own eyes because I was asleep.  My children were watching TV at the lounge.  They say it was 9 o'clock.  This man went through the patio door and came to my bedroom window.  That really didn't matter.  Then later on, when I got a call - I didn't doubt or ask myself as to why he had done that, then thereafter I got a call which told me that there is a person in Umtata who has been put there to kill all the Maphumulo children.  I didn't really believe that, but on that very same day I received a call in Umtata.  I got the message from a certain house.  I will mention the person who brought me the message.  He said I must be told that there is a certain person who was pretending to be Maphumulo's friend, but he wasn't really Maphumulo's friend.  He had been sent to come and kill the Maphumulo family.  Now, when I got this call I was told that a person was being planted in Umtata.  I reported this matter to the police.  The police came, they stood guard at my house.  This man came as usual.  On this very day he didn't stay for long.  I asked him why on that day he was going around in circles in my house, because usually he gets into the house and sits.  The answer that still puzzles me even today is that he said to me, \"I had come to tender the grass.\"  This answer still puzzles me even today, because I want this person to tell me how he could want to tender grass at 9 o'clock in the evening?  What sort of grass was that?  What did he mean by that?",
