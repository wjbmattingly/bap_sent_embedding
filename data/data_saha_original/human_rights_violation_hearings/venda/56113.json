They took him, they go with him and then he went back.  The CID goes and he returned back.\n After a short time, they returned back and then they came back home and then they took my brother and go with him.  When they have gone with him, they come back again and then they told us that they have arrested him.\n It is then that they were saying that he was in possession of illegal firearms.  It is then that they arrested him and then it is true, he is having it and then he showed them the gun.\n It is then that they took him and he was tortured.  They used to tie him by chains.  One day he was handcuffed.  One day when he was coming back home, he used to come back wearing something which you cannot see his face.\n When coming back home, trying to see what they were doing with him, even at his home, they did not allow us and chased us like dogs and saying they don't want to see anybody here.\n And he was forced to have other guns, but in fact he was not having other guns.   They used to dig his -  he was forced to dig his house, digging his house and he was kicked and he was hurt.\n They never allowed us to go near him.  Go with him one \nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 NE SHONISANI\nday, one day they took him to the mountain and he was forced to admit false charges because he was feeling the pain.\n It is then that he happened to admit something which he did not know and truly, he knew nothing, but he just admitted because he was feeling the pains.\n In 1980 here in the police station he was beaten.  He once told me that the person who used to beat him, is Mr Ramoswana and a Mr Ramaliqela.\n He was beaten.  In 1980, at eight o'clock they used to go and beat him.  From there, they came back home again.\n There were many with many vans and then they surrounded the whole house.  When we tried to go near them, we were not allowed and he was forced to dig the house knowing nothing.\n It is then that when his case was opened and I was not knowing what to do, then I tried to find a lawyer for him.  We were told that if we find a lawyer, we are all going to be arrested.\n It is then that a lawyer was found and then the lawyers were there and they were treating the case on his behalf.  Then that was how it ended.  From then we were called again by the very same CID's.  They sent us to some other offices where there are some CID's.  \n There was a big \"trommel\", tramped in with, there were a lot of old jackets, big ones.  They wanted us to believe and say we had to confirm that it belonged to my brother.  And we said, we never knew anything.\n The CID took the very same \"trommel\" and dug a whole in the garden so that the family members will say it belonged to them.\n He suffered a great deal out of what they did to him.  He is now not present.  On working, he was complaining of \nVENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n4 NE SHONISANI\npains all over the body, they way they kicked him.\n He suffered a great deal.  Again we thank God that we will have discovered that they will take him to prison and could be acquitted.\n The policemen of that time were very cruel.  Subsequently he was charged for five years and then he stayed five years in prison.  After that period expired, then he came back.",

Just before you go - sorry, just before you go - just two questions I want to ask you.\n The first is about your brother on whose behalf you are VENDA HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n8 NE SHONISANI\nspeaking.  In your statement you say that he once told me that on the day that they took him to the mountain they beat him, they tied him on the tree and the made a fire under the tree to burn his private parts.  And you said that your brother today is useless, it was the word that you used.\n Were you referring to the kind of torture that he experienced - is there a connection between the burning of his private parts and what you were saying about his life presently?",

            "Elizabeth, I am going to ask you if you could please, we will try to contact your brother as well, but if you could also tell him to come to the Commission and to make a statement.  And then finally you're speaking about your brother - but what we would like to know is whether anything happened to you as the sister?  Were you ever harassed because of the activities that your brother was accused of being involved in?",
