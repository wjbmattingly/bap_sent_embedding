<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me greet you.  I want to thank you for your presence.  I want to confirm your names, are you Nofinish Minah Blaauw, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS BLAAUW:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For a number of reasons, among them, the reason of time, and the fact that there are many of you here who also need a chance to talk here today, I'm going to read what is important, what is in this statement and you are going to confirm if all this is correct.  If there is somewhere where you think it is not right, maybe some of the things you forgot to include, you can just add them afterwards but the most important thing right now for the other witnesses here, is to ensure that everything in this statement is correct and they must also tell what happened to them or maybe to their friends or relatives and how the whole situation affected them.  In conclusion they must also state clearly their requests to the Commission.</p>
