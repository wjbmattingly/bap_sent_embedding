<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are going to call upon our last witness who will then be the last, so that we can be able to go to the scene of the incident as said earlier on by the Commissioner. Let me firstly affirm your full names, Mr Bhana, because we did not have the opportunity to receive a statement from you whereby you would give full explanation about yourself. What are your full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">KHYALETU PATRICK BHANA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> My full names are Khyaletu Patrick Bhana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you one of the people who was affected by the shooting there on that day in question on the 21 March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, I was greatly affected by this attack of the 21 March 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could I ask that you should briefly explain, where you were at the time the people were going for the funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> I would say I was in the third row and I was in front.  We were holding hands as comrades and we were advancing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage were you shot, Mr Bhana?</p>

<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>2 K BHANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Mr Chairperson, at the time they were starting to shoot, I stopped holding hands and I ran facing the 15th Avenue and I went up running very fast and before I had intentions to get into one of the houses but unfortunately, one of the houses was closed and there were people dressed in green clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the time they were hitting you with the bullet, had you already ran away from the scene of the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, I had, because I felt if they had shot me I would have fallen there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they actually hit you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, they did.  Whilst I was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did they shoot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> They shot me at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you the one who said you got into a nearby yard where the shooting was taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then what happened were you were in that yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> What happened is that I was not far from the scene of the incident and I was in the yard, and as I was getting into a certain house these people tried to lock me out and whilst I was getting to the bedroom I heard some gun shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now tell us where did they actually hit you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> They hit me at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you get any help from hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, I was treated in one hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What hospital was that?  Is it the same hospital where all these victims were being sent to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, that was in Livingstone Hospital.</p>

<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>3 K BHANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who took you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> I was taken from this house to Church Street, and then I was taken to provincial hospital and I was driven in an ambulance to Livingstone Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you tell us about the injuries that you sustained as reported by the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> The doctor did not give me any explanation pertaining to the injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any pains that you still feel today as a result of the shooting, or do you still have some treatment you get from the doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> There is no treatment that I get from doctors and I really feel a lot of pain because I had eight bullet wounds and some other times when it is overcast, my body becomes painful.</p>

<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> I got some assistance there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, what kind of assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> I mean financial assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, are you ready to tell us how much you actually received there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> I received R8 000 at the Jubilee Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there a lawyer assisting you to get this money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, I got this money because a lawyer assisted me to get it.  My lawyer was Molly Blackpan.</p>

<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> My request is that this Commission should bring forward Lieutenant Fouche to come and give an account of the blood and the killing that he administered on this particular day.</p>

<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> I have got a lot of things to say, but we are now trying to summarise otherwise I would be saying more and really there is just no time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything that's new?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BHANA:</span> Yes, there is.  At the time I was in this bedroom, where these policemen took me out, the policemen pushed in a firearm through the window and I pleaded, asking that people should open the door and they did.  This I mentioned in my statement.  Then one Afrikaner said, yes, you red trouser, you are making a struggle, so I am trying to say that these Boers, they mark us so that is as far as I can go.</p>
