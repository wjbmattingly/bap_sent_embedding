We used to see him joining the toyi toyi, but on this particular day, we were not aware that he was there. Then I noticed that he was not present, then we said that if he was there, he would of been very proud that he was one of the people making a toyi toyi, but I was unhappy that it was quite some time that we\nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n2 B MBIXANA\ncouldn't see him, so I decided to go to Motherwell and I asked why it was dark in the house.  Then in fact there was another sister of mine, who invited me to get into the house so I went in, and I asked why, then he said that Mpimpi died.  Then I was shocked.  Then he said to me don't talk aloud because you will be killed then I said no, I don't care for that.  I asked who the people were, who had done this because I want to see the body.  Then he tried to stop me, but I forced my way.\n I went away, and on my way I met a young boy and I asked about the base around here.  Then this boy referred me to a house of a member of the street committee.",

Then in this house, that belonged to this lady, I asked about Mpimpi, and he said, oh, please whisper, don't talk loudly about it because it is long that Mpimpi died.  Then I said, then how can I get his body, and I asked who the murderers were.  Then he said that he was killed by Msindise and Sam, and another one.  Then I said that he must show me where these people lived so that I can demand his body.  Then he discouraged me, stating that I could be killed, but I forced my way.\n And on my way, I met one other boy who made some signs and these children were very violent at that time, so I went there and I pleaded with him, and asked where Mpimpi's body was, then he said please wait and he asked someone else to come and said, this lady is looking for Mpimpi, so we must give her some bus fare, and they asked me to bring a coffin, together with spades, so I did exactly that.  \n I went to those children in this car, and it was quite \nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n3 B MBIXANA\nlate in the day and then I said here is a car, I have brought it to you.  Then I asked them to direct me to the body.  Then they said, wait.  Then a friend of Mpimpi came out from a crowd and called me aside and said that I shouldn't go with these people, then he asked us to turn back.  Then all of a sudden, there were caspers, there were helicopters and they urged us that we should turn back because they thought we were clever, so we decided to speed back to Port Elizabeth.\n I thought perhaps that his body had been picked up by someone, or perhaps by the ambulance people, so we went to the mortuary, but we couldn't find his body.  Then we even went to the Uitenhage mortuary and on our way to Port Elizabeth, we saw a child that had been burnt, and I thought it was him, but I was making a mistake.\n Then there was a prayer meeting.  There were prayers for the whole week.  Then on the first day, the policemen fetched me and they found out from me what was happening at home, and I told them that we had lost a brother and they asked why the people of the Church were jumping, then I confirmed that these people were from the church, and they felt dissatisfied and they said that one day I would tell the truth.\n Then, just before the funeral, they again decided to go back and did not find that corpse that we had seen and then we stopped conducting prayers and then the White men were after me.  Even for about three times, they would come and collect me and assault me and then I decided to escape to the Transkei.",
