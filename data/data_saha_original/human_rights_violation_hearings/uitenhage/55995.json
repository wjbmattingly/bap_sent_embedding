I took an advantage that they had handcuffed me then I decided to dive into the water and they kept me under water for some time, but I had breathed in sufficiently, then they kicked me vigorously. I was not crying, they again then dipped me into the water, I again managed but water managed to get in through the mouth and my stomach was full of water and they stamped on my stomach and water came out of my mouth and I was crying. \n I kept on pleading with Faleni, that \"Oh, you as black as you are, why do you torture me like that?\" and Faleni said - Faleni again dipped me into the water for the third time and they kept me under water for some time and I stayed there. I gave in, I was kicking in this sack and I was uncomfortable. I was trying to send a message that I couldn't breathe any longer, so they took me out and they took me out of the sack and put me outside.\n I looked at where they were standing, but I was not intending to run away because there were many of them. They took out a gas stove and they had a braai as they had indicated earlier. I asked that I wanted to relieve myself and that was a mistake, they asked me to lie on this sack and they pressed me on the stomach and then water came out through all the openings - they braaied and they asked me to dress up, so what happened is that they gave me a blanket that they had got from somewhere and they covered me and put me in the back seat of the car. \n There were many cars driving in still - and we were driving towards town, driving to Uitenhage. It was dark, at about 8.00pm. I thought we were coming here only to find that they were on the Durban road. I could not even see anyone that I could talk to. I thought they were now going to kill me.\n We drove past Nboshleli location towards Rocklands and facing Jeffreys Bay. When we got to Jeffreys there was an old white man who was going to take care of me, because what they were doing is they were transferring people from one place to the other.\n I still remember some people from Knysna, I would meet in Orange Free State. Whilst I was still in the van a Kombi drove and all the other cars followed. We were getting to Humansdorp and when we got to that destination, again we met another white old man who directed us to a cell and there had been a white man who had committed suicide and I could see his hair and I could not sleep. I even had to talk aloud because of fear and say \"I am not responsible for your death\" - I could not sleep until morning, because I was scared. This old man asked whether I was not hungry, so he bought food for me.\nREVD. XUNDU: Now, let's agree you were there for a week and then they came for you?",
