<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CCHAIRPERSON:  We are going to ask Mr Vincent Lungile Calu </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>to come forward.  We are going to hand you over to Ms Maya </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>who is going to lead you with questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>VINCENT LUNGILE CALU:  (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>MS MAYA:  Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Lungile, how are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>MR CALU:  I am fine, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>MS MAYA:  You are going to represent yourself and tell us a </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>story about the time you were a member of the UDF and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>say you were arrested several times and tortured in police </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>custody, what was actually happening, and what was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>reason for all of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR CALU:  In 1985, I don't know whether to say that I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>lucky or unlucky, but I got affected and I became one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>members of the structures for the youth.  I therefore had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>go away from my home in Uitenhage, to I had to go in hiding </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>in one of the houses in Nobuhle.  I used to spend nights in </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>various places and briefly, I would say that in 1986, one </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>day, I was tired of sleeping all over the place, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>decided to go and sleep at home and it was on a Saturday and </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>yet, I was wrong because these policemen came and it was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>the morning, very early, at about 3:00, and I heard my </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>mother saying Lungile is not here because she knew that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>was not sleeping there and she wasn't aware that I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>there, so these police came and my mother said that I wasn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>2 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>there and there was three of us sons there.  When they came </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>in, they asked for Umhlahla, then I said, no, I don't know </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>such a person.  Then they asked my brother, where is </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>Umhlahla, my brother denied, and my other brother too </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>denied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MS MAYA:  Who was Umhlahla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MR CALU:  Umhlahla is me, I am Umhlahla.  Then, these whites </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>asked who exactly amongst you is Umhlahla, and everyone </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>denied, infact, I wanted any one person who was going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>point at me, and these policemen were almost tired of asking </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>of this Umhlahla and I heard them saying in Afrikaans that </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>they should go and call someone from outside, and so this </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>person came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> My brothers at the time, lived in Molapo, and this </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>Molapo men came in and said to me, you are Umhlahla, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>was discouraged and then I didn't say anything, then these </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>policemen said get dressed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR MAYA:  Were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MR CALU:  Yes, I was arrested.  Outside our house, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>were a lot of cars and I got into a car, and there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>driver sitting in front and a space here in the middle, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>I was asked to sit there in that space.  Then they asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>about the gun that they said that I had, then I said that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>did not have a gun.  They asked this repeatedly, then they </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>asked for Lungisile, then I said you arrested Lungisile last </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>week, so I don't know why you are asking me about Lungisile. </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a> Then they asked me, do you know anything about Bee's?  Then </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>I knew about Bee's, but I didn't want to say that I knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>them, because I was scared that perhaps they meant something </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>else.  I didn't answer them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> Then, they handcuffed me with my hands at the back, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>3 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>I was sitting in this space, in this car and they asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>whether I was going to tell the truth or did I want them to </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>bring in the bee's.  Then I said that I don't have any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>truth, I do not have any gun.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a> Then one other man who was there, there were some some </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>people, one of them was Dumse and these people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>informers and they were there.  So they blindfolded me with </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>a towel and they made it stiff so that I was not able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>breathe.  My whole body trembled and I thought perhaps that </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>these were the bee's that they had mentioned earlier and </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>some other times they would make this knot loose and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>would ask me to tell the truth, but I insisted that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>was no other truth that I could tell.  Then they took this </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>thing, and they put it here in my testicles and I had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>feeling as if my testicles were being twisted and being </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>pulled because I kept on saying I don't know, I don't know, </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>very fast.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>MS MAYA:  As your body was trembling, what were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>MR CALU:  They were administering some electric shocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>MS MAYA:  Who was administering this electric shock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MR CALU:  I couldn't see because they had blindfolded me </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>with a towel, but I could feel me whole body trembling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MS MAYA:  How long did this take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR CALU:  For about 15 minutes, but they would give me a </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>relief and once again.  Then in this car there was Ngobe, </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>there was Nokasi, there was Dumse.  Then they asked why </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>Pinkise had been arrested, then they said that Pikinse was </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>brother to Nokasi and so ultimately Pikinse was released.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a> Then one White man asked that I should be released and </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>then one said Ngashla was the commander of the action </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>committee that does this toy toy.</p>

<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>4 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a> They took off my hat and then one person was insisting </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>that I be released and they asked to release me and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>asked me to go away and I went home and found my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>MS MAYA:  Then, when was the next arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MR CALU:  I want to say what I want to say before that.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>was early on a Sunday.  I then consulted Dr Moodley, using </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>someones medical aid card because I was on the run.  Dr </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>Moodley examined me and asked what had happened to me.  Then </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>I told him that the police had electrocuted me and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>explained to me several things saying that these people had </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>exceeded in their administering of the electric shock and so </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>Dr Moodley asked me to take out two of my teeth that had </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>been damaged, so I had them extracted on Monday.  So I again </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>went into hiding and the police still kept on looking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a> Then in 1987, we had escaped once more and I was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>Port Elizabeth living in Betram Street.  Then my aunt who </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>came from Zwide, and she told me that she was sick and had </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>they had not gone to work and she was saying that she must </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>consult a doctor.  This whole day, the policemen had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>moving up and down here in Betram Street, but, I had a hope </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>that they did not know me, but I was wrong.  Then there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>a car facing our house.  It was parked in Matitiba, facing </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>our house.  My aunt asked that I should not accompany her </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>because there were policemen, but I refused.  Then, as soon </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>as I got to Betrom, I saw some cars that were speeding </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>towards me and the policemen jumped out and they were facing </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>there fire arms towards me.  They searched my whole body, </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>they searched me thoroughly, they took a walkie talkie and </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>they asked what was me name, and I told them my name was </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>Mongezi, and I could see that they were communicating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>5 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MS MAYA:  Did you know these people who had arrested you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MR CALU:  No, I did not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a> They took me to the house where I came from and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>again searched the house.  They did not tell me what they </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>were looking for.  Then, this Black man said to me, these </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>men are looking for a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MS MAYA:  Did they get the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>MR CALU:  No, they did not get any firearm from me.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>took me to Louis Le Grange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>MS MAYA:  What did they do to you there, did they </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>interrogate you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR CALU:  No, they said, yes, this is the one.  This is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>one we are looking for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MS MAYA:  Who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR CALU:  Jagter said this.  That is a Uitenhage detective </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>who is now a Captain in Le Grange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a> So, I spent the night there.  The following morning, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>was called at about 6 o'clock in the morning and I went up </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>to the seventh floor where they were seated in a round table </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>and they asked whether I had a firearm, they asked this </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>question repeatedly and I told them that I did not have one. </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a> Then, they took out a parcel and which had some soil inside </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>and they asked me, do you know anything about this?  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>looked at it, and I could see that it was mine, and then I </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>was scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MS MAYA:  Did you know this parcel that was shown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MR CALU:  Yes, I knew that it was mine, but to them, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>denied that it belonged to me. I then identified this </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>parcel.  Then, they opened this parcel.  It had some bullets </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>for a 9mm fire arm, there were 45 of these bullets.  Then </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>they opened another plastic, there was a magazine with 15 </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>6 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>bullets and a magazine and they asked, where is the main </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>part of this cassette, then I said to them, I know nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>about this thing.  They asked about the bullets of the 9mm, </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>I said I knew nothing about it.  Then they said Lulamile, </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>your sister said that these belonged to you, and I denied </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>it.  They kept on interrogating me, trying to get the truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>and then one Coloured person, who's name was Campbell, </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>because I could understand them as they were speaking </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>Afrikaans, that I heard that his name was Campbell, then he </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>again asked me, do you know anything about the bee's, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>then I said that I know the bee's.  But I said to him that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>know nothing about bee's.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a> Then he made me sit down, I want to demonstrate how he </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>made me sit down.  This is how I sat, and there was a stick </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>just layed here on my hands.  I had to hold the stick.  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>call this action of sitting the helicopter, so they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>cover me with plastic and tie it very tight, so as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>suffocate me.  They again used the thing a doctor uses when </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>he is trying to determine your blood pressure and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>tightened it and I was hanging in one of the tables, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>they would do this for five minutes, then relax and then go </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>back once more and all this time, they were asking me who </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>things these were.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a> So, they ultimately said that these things belonged to </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>me, then they asked with whom was I staying, then I said I </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>was staying with Aubrey and Tini, because if they wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>go there, they were not going to find them.  Then they kept </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>on torturing me for about 10 days, following the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>procedures as that on the third day.   I appeared in court </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>and there was an allegation that I owned all these things, </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>that was in May.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>7 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a> Then, from the court, I was locked in, in Algoa Park </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>and I was there for three days, and then transferred to La </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>Grange. For this whole month, people at home did not know </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>anything about my whereabouts.  Then, on the 5th, I saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>someone in court and sent a message to my family that I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>in Le Grange.  And then Vanessa came on the 5th, saying that </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>it is long that they had been looking for me.  Then, Vanessa </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>said she was late and promised to come back the following </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>day and she came and already was from upstairs and Vanessa </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>said, you are being charged in this way, and she told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>what I was being accused of,  And I had to appear therefore </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>on the 24 June, and my advocate was Mr Pillay, and Mr Pillay </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>got information from Campbell that a certain Mr X had </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>informed them with information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a> The following day, they took my sister and made her to </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>agree that I was responsible for all this and they belonged </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>to me and this case was postponed and anyway, I was found </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>not guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>MS MAYA:  Now, did you ultimately admit, do you ultimately </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>know who brought this parcel to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>MR CALU:  Even now, I am still wondering about who brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>this, because when we were hiding these things, there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>three of us, it was me, Abrey and Kiki.  So I was worried </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>when this parcel landed in the wrong hands, landed in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>hands of the people who were not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MS MAYA:  Where are they now?  Did you ask them about this </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>parcel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>MR CALU:  What about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MS MAYA:  That who actually took it to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>MR CALU:  People say, I noticed this.  Jagter said that all </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>comrades are working for us and he said to me, in 1986, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>8 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>once planned to get to Durban, and I denied because I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>not gone there.  We had planned to go there, but our plans </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>got aborted.  So, I did not follow the comrades, but I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>very happy that this person was found and I was not the </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>informer.  All I knew was that this Mr X was one of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>MS MAYA:  Then, how has this torture affected your health?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>MR CALU:  When the police tortured me, they affected my </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>health.  Some other times I feel that my body becomes </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>painful even if it is in the morning.  They did not only </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>electrocute me, but the kicked me as well, but what mostly </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>effected me was the electric shock that I was subjected to </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>and it caused a lot of damage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>MS MAYA:  What is your request to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>MR CALU:  I didn't mention, here when they were writing this </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>statement, that I would like this Commission to take note of </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>this, that this was not done to me because I was Ngahle, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>they were trying to damage the idea that we as Black could </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>think we could liberate this country.  So all this happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>under the conditions of discouraging the various structures </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>and they various organisations that were fighting for </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>freedom of this country, all this was not directed to me but </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>it just happened that I got affected.  It was politically </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>motivated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a> Then, I am asking this Commission, I know that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>isn't much that it can do, but I recognise it as it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>appointed by the government, perhaps it has the power that </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>we as all the victims here in South Africa, could especially </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>those who got disabled during this struggle, because looking </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>at the other countries, I find that incidents of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>nature, were happening, but their governments did attend to </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>9 V CALU</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>their victims, and those people got some compensation </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>because these people did give their lives in this battle for </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>the people.  If perhaps I had not joined the struggle, </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>perhaps my mother would still be alive, she died because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>was arrested, repeatedly, and this greatly affected her </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MS MAYA:  Could I ask you that you should allow me to help </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>you so that we could conclude.  Your request is that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>should be projects for job creations, those are the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>who could not further their education because of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>tortures of that time, and even those who are still at </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>school should be assisted to go back to school and even </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>those who are disabled, should be assisted through, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>they definitely had some goals.  So if they were to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>assisted to achieve their ambitions, you would feel very </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>comfortable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>MR CALU:  Yes, I did say so. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>MS MAYA:  Thank you.</p>
