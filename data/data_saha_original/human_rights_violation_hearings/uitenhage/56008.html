<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  We are now going to call Danile Wilberforce </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>May.  Mr Sandi will lead you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>DANILE WILBERFORCE MAY:  (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>MR SANDI:  Mr May, when I look at your statement, your </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>complaint is in a certain year, in the past years, a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>gentlemen whom you are going to mention later on, accused </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>you in Port Elizabeth, that you were a police informer or </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>sell out.  Because of this allegation, by this person, a lot </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>of things happened to you.  Just before we get into that, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>May, can we start with some of the important things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>Right now, you are no longer staying in Port ElizabEth, </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>where are you staying, Mr May?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MR MAY:  I am staying in Gauteng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>MR SANDI:  Let's make it quick Mr May, and get into details </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>of what you are going to talk about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>MR MAY:  Thank you very much Mr Sandi.  I am one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>people who were in the forefront.  The people who formed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>organisation called Zwide Residential Organisation.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>with Mr Tozamile Botha.  The aim of this organisation was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>fight that the then municipality, we mustn't pay for rates. </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>By that time we didn't know that people are supposed to pay </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>for water.  We formed this organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MR SANDI:  What year was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MR MAY:  That was in 1979.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>2 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR SANDI:  Can you mention again, the name of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>organisation</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>MR MAY:  It was Zwide Residential Association.  After this </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>organisation was formed, we sat down as members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>executive committee, which among them where people like, </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>Sipho Grootbom and Tolile Mbepe and others.  We took a </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>decision that the level of this organisation is not big </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>MR SANDI:  Couldn't you form a bigger organisation than that </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>MR MAY:  There was another organisation for the people of </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>Fort Tishas called the Fort Organisation, and another one </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>which was called Gwasakeli for residents.  With the leaders </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>of these organisations, we formed another one which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>called PEPCO.  During this time, in Zwide, Mr Botha was </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>president, and I was his secretary, when we formed this </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>organisation.  In all the meetings that we used to hold, </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>they used to be big at that time because most of the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>were mostly interested in this matter of rent and water.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>was always in front as a secretary of this organisation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>Tozamile Botha who was a spokesman, this was for Zwide </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>Residential Association.  I was a secretary and Tozamile </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>Botha was a chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a> He managed that in this organisation, there was a rent </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>boycott which was discussed by these.  I was for the rent </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>boycott and Tozamile was against the rent boycott. The rent </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>boycott was successful because I was always the MC of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>organisation, and I managed.  I was a leader of this rent </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>boycott.  The people were not paying rent in Zwide, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>people were not paying for water, they were not paying for </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>electricity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>3 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a> In September, I can't remember the date, whether it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>1979, we formed this PEPCO because we wanted this thing to </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>take place all over, not only in Zwide, but also in Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a> After forming PEPCO, since there was fault in Zwide, </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>and Gwazakeli, we had to create Walmer and New Brighton </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>townships.  During a certain year, I think it was towards </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>the end of 1980 or the beginning of 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>MR SANDI:  Excuse me Mr May, without interrupting you, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>want to confirm that we are together with these events.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>are talking the formation of PEPCO.  It is you and Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>Tozamile Botha who were executive members of PEPCO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>MR MAY:  Thank you.  Because of the fact that there was this </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>rent boycott, which was taking place only in Zwide, I was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>longer of the Zwide, but I was not in the top executive of </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>PEPCO, so I remained being the secretary of this other </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>association.  Being a leader of this rent boycott which took </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>place in 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a> Towards the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>there was a residents meeting in Walmer, it was very hot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>During that time, PEPCO was popular in the Western Cape.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>During this meeting, we also had another meeting for Zwide </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>residents.  I was left being a leader of the Randville Court </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>in Zwide and I was in charge of that meeting, which was held </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>in Kaalnets Cinema on that particular evening.  During that </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>particular evening, the executive of Pepcore including </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>Chume.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>MR SANDI:  Mr May, can we just talk about this meeting where </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>you were accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>MR MAY:  I am coming bit by bit.  On that particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>meeting, people like  Palochimoto, Zamile Botha from Walmer, </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>4 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>were arrested by the police.  I was in Zwide, in a meeting </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>there.  The following day, I got the information that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>were arrested.  After that, as the people who formed this </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>PEPCO, we took a decision that if they are arrested, we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>still facing this matter of rent boycott, we rather start </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>campaigning and fund raise.  We fund raised in Zwide </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>Residential Association.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>MR SANDI:  Excuse me Mr May, I would request that you stick </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>to the incident that affected you as a person, as a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>who is complaining.  While you are still there, I am going </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>to ask you questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a> In that meeting, where you say Mr Botha accused you, </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>did he tell you the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>MR MAY:  No, he didn't explain anything to me, he may have </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>told the other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>MR SANDI:  Were you present at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>MR MAY:  No, I was not in the first meeting, the one that </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>was held in front of my house, with his colleague.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>MR SANDI:  Who was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MR MAY:  My wife was in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>MR SANDI:  These two meetings that you are referring to, do </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>you refer to the meetings that you are inside the house, or </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>just the meetings that were held in an open place just like </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>MR MAY:  When he came back from detention, he didn't come </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>back to the meetings because they were banned.  The meeting </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>that he used to hold were the private meetings.  On this </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>particular night, he had a meeting with Fort workers that's </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>when they decided to go to my place where they held the </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>meeting in front of my house and he brought these </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>accusations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>5 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR SANDI:  Were you present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MR MAY:  No, my wife was in the house, I came, and it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>towards the end of the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>MR SANDI:  Were there other people who came to you and told </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>you that you are accused by Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>MR MAY:  When I arrived at this meeting, as it was held at </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>the front of my house, when I heard that they were talking </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>about me, and I told them that I was present, I wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>know what was happening, but there were people who told me </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>that Botha is saying this and that about me.  I wanted the </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>meeting to continue, but the meeting was terminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR SANDI:  Did you ask Mr Botha what me meant by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>MR MAY:  About in the past 6 to 7 weeks I met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MR SANDI:  I mean, during the time before he left the </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>country, did you make any efforts that a person who said all </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>these things about you in public, you meet that particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>person and asked for an explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>MR MAY:  During that very same week, I called a meeting, </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>which was held in Countsnemmar, which was on a Sunday, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>wanted a full explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>MR SANDI:  Did you get any explanation, what was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MR MAY:  The meeting was adjourned without him coming </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>forward to explain the accusations, instead he repeated that </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>I sold him out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>MR SANDI:  You continue in your statement saying that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>Botha left the country, going to another country.  How did </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>you get that information, did you read that information in </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>the newspaper, or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>MR MAY:  I was staying in no.32 Mangai Street, and he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>staying directly opposite my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>6 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>MR SANDI:  You even said in your statement, because of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>accusations, you decided to quit politics, you decided to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>a business man.  Is there any specific reason, or any </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>motivation that lead you to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>MR MAY:  During that time, the Pepcore was divided into two </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>groups.  It was destroyed, and there were two groups formed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>there is Kosana and Mr Botha.  I decided to step down, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>no longer working as a person who was working in Barclays </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>Bank then, I discovered that if I was going to concentrate </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>on politics, I was not going to gain anything.  I decided to </p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>work for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>MR SANDI:  Just before we go to the list of things that </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>happened to you because of these accusations, I would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>to ask a question.  Are your comrades, the very comrades </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>that you were with in that Pepcore Organisation, did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>tell them the reasons for you to quit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>MR MAY:  The majority of the Pepcore, with the majority of </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>the Pepcore Founders, we stepped in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>MR SANDI:  Can we go now to the details, where you say as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>businessman, you started a business as a Paratics man in </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>1984, and you got married.  What incident took place in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>life during the time you were a businessman because of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>accusations in 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>MR MAY:  The first one that I can talk about, on a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>day, I was on my way to a business meeting.  I went past </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>Motherwell.  My business was in Motherwell, because I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>evicted from my house.  I was in front of Mr Klaasie's house </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>who is a brother of Mr Golo, the owner of the Themba Labanto </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>Supermarket.  He was also a business partner, we were going </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>to a meeting on that particular day.  I went past his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>MR SANDI:  Do you refer to this particular day in 1985, </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>7 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>whereby the Themba Labanto Supermarket in Veeplaas, where </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>you had a business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>MR MAY:  Yes, I am referring to that particular day, but my </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>business was in Motherwell Township, but I went to another </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>businessman who was in Veeplaas because we were going to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>same meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>MR SANDI:  Let us talk about that day at Themba Labanto </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>Supermarket.  You say people came in, on that particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>day, people who called themselves comrades, or the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>that you believed were comrades, these people abducted you? </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>What did they say, did they give you any reasons for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>abduction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>MR MAY:  They said that I sold out Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>MR SANDI:  Do you know these people who were doing this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>MR MAY:  If I can go up and down, I can get one of them, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>I don't know, nobody knows who were doing these things, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>it is not very easy to point them, but they were comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>MR SANDI:  You mentioned two gentlemen in your statement.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>You say that they helped you to escape.  Can you briefly </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>tell about how you knew the men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>MR MAY:  If the two gentlemen that you are referring to are </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>Mr Glass and Mr Aplay, I am not sure if you are talking </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>about them, can you please confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>MR SANDI:  Yes, I wanted you to mention those names, thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>you.  ...(Tape ends)...</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR MAY:  Because we were going to attend a meeting together. </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a> He is the one, that when these comrades abducted me, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>forced that he was not going to be left behind.  He followed </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>with his car, behind my car, the one that was taken by these </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>comrades.  Mr Glass saw where these comrades took me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>MR SANDI:  You said that this Mr Glass, is late now, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>8 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>was the cause of his death, is it because of that conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>MR MAY:  No, he died in a car accident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>MR SANDI:  Before we go further, I want to ask this </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>question, you say that on this particular day, you survived </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>the necklace, they were going to necklace you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>MR MAY:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>MR SANDI:  Was there any evidence that they were going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>necklace you?  Did they have a tyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>MR MAY:  The petrol was drained from my car, and they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>even going to use my own spare wheel, and my petrol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>MR SANDI:  On the 31 December 1991, you say that among the </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>businesses that you had, you say that you had a butchery, a </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>club house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>MR MAY:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>MR SANDI:  Before we talk about that, I would like to go </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>back to that second gentleman, who helped you, besides Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>Aplay.  Is that Mr Sitelo Aplay who was head of the Anti </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>Crime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>MR MAY:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>MR SANDI:  Yes, we can go on now.  You say that in that Club </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>House on the 31 December, can you briefly tell us what </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>MR MAY:  On the 31 December, about 7:30 in the evening, </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>people fought in my tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>MR SANDI:  Who were fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>MR MAY:  It was me, and the other comrades who were about 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>MR SANDI:  Is there anything that they said concerning the </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>accusations of Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>MR MAY:  There was nothing, there was no accusation which </p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>was connected to Mr Botha, besides the fact that they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>saying that I am rich because of the money from the Boers.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>9 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>Though I was telling them to go home, because I wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>close the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>MR SANDI:  Do you say that this attack is connected to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>accusation of Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>MR MAY:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>MR SANDI:  Can you tell us the reason why you reconcile the </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>two, whereas they said nothing concerning that accusation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>MR MAY:  These people were comrades, who abducted me, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>were going to necklace me.  It was also the comrades who sat </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>in my house forcefully.  The fact that they said that I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>rich because of the money from the Boers, as a person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>was an informer, who sold Mr Botha, that is the reason why I </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>connect the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>MR SANDI:  Do you say, on the 1 January 1992, when you went </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>to your businesses, you were told that there were combis </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>that are looking for you, the combis that belonged to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>comrades, did they tell you who these comrades were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>MR MAY:  No, I was not told.  They just said to me that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>comrades were looking for me, the comrades from Motherwell </p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>were looking for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>MR SANDI:  But because you heard that it was a combi that </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>was looking for you, you decided to go and see a certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>gentleman whom you refer as Mr Mondem Ntanga, who was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>chairman of the Mother Well Civic Organisation.  Did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>talk with Mr Ntanga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>MR MAY:  Before I could talk to Mr Ntanga, they arrived, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>workers arrived before I could even open the business.  When </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>I opened the business, the comrades came and told me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>they want me in there meeting but they didn't tell me the </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>reason.  I decided to go and meet the chairman of the branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>of the Pepcore of Motherwell, which was Mr Ntanga then.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>10 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>wanted to know the agenda for that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>MR SANDI:  The investigation that Mr Ntanga said he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>going to make concerning this.  Was there anything that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>gathered from that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>MR MAY:  When I arrived there, before 10:00, I went to him </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>as a person, who was a chairman because I wanted to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>more about the agenda because he told me that he is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>clear about the agenda, because it is the ASEP, and Azapo.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>He is not the one who called the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>MR SANDI:  Do you mean that you arrived in the meeting which </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>had it's own matters that were to be discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>MR MAY:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>MR SANDI:  By the way, you said what happened to your </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>butchery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>MR MAY:  In this meeting, I was requested to wait outside.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>They called me at about 11:30.  At about 11:30 I was told </p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>that the decision has been taken that I must go and close </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>down all my businesses in Motherwell and I must leave Mother </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>Well before 12:00 that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>MR SANDI:  Who took over your butchery, the butcher that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>complained about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>MR MAY:  First of all, I closed my butchery because it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>the 1 December 1992.  I closed my butchery and everything </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>was rotten, especially the food.  I tried to consult people </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>telephonically, I was writing to them, I was going to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>people personally for help, but instead of getting a </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>positive answer from these people, after three of four </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>months, I discovered that someone has taken over by the name </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>of Wiseman Kula, who was the co-chairman of that meeting </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>where he requested that I close my butchery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>MR SANDI:  In order for us to reach our conclusion, you said </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>11 D MAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>because of this treatment, you left Port Elizabeth, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>decided to go to Gauteng, are you a businessman there also?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>MR MAY:  No, I am just staying there. I am just sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>MR SANDI:  Towards our conclusion, Mr May, what are your </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>wishes, what is your request to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>MR MAY:  My first wish is I want to get a full explanation </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>and he must also tell the people of Port Elizabeth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>Uitenhage about me and he mustn't say that even when I come, </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>the people must not look at me and feel jealous, he must </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>just explain the details of these accusations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>MR SANDI:  Among other things, you say you request that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>Commission must investigate about your butchery and your </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>Club House, the one that you lost under those conditions.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>How can you regain them is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>MR MAY:  It is not only that, I want you to investigate, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>I want this commission to get my butchery back from the ANC. </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a> I know that you don't have enough money, but ANC has got </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>some means to bring back my house and by butchery and my </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>family and to regain my dignity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>MR SANDI:  Thank you very much Mr May, we are going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>investigate, we are going to find the truth, you can now go </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>back to your seat.</p>
