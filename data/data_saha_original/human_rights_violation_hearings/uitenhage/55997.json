Now the reason why I say since yesterday it is a concern of mine is because even yesterday here were people I have mentioned to some of these officers here, we testify here and we name peoples names, thus implicating some people and some of them are here.  Tomorrow you people as a Commission would go and find out whether this is a lot of lies or lies that we are telling you.  That is your duty I believe, but when trying to establish the truth, how much time have the people that listened in yesterday and today and tomorrow or whenever they listened in, how much time have they got to destroy whatever you are looking for.

I want to say to you that Mr Berry says that there is a certain Mr M W Anderson who was the secretary of the Diaz Divisional Council who told you that you were fired because you had become an embarrassment to the council.  He said that because you decided to stand for the truth, both of you, and because you stood for the truth at that time you became an embarrassment to their Council.\n I want to say that on behalf of the Commission we hope the time will come and it shall not be long when this nation will pause and say you are not an embarrassment to this nation, you are in fact assets of this nation, because you stood for the truth.  We are hoping that the nation should pause one time to say that to both of you.  We are aware of the requests that you have made in terms of your dismissals and we are going to follow those up.  You reminded us, both of you, that there was a time in this country when standing for the truth cost a price, and those comrades that became comrades in 1990 and 1991 after that sometimes forget that, that there was a time in this country when standing for the truth cost something.  Some people lost their lives, others like the guy who was here lost their legs, their limbs.  \nUITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE\n12 V GOQO\nOthers lost their loved ones and indeed many people when the crunch came decided not to stand for the truth because they preferred to nurse the opposition in light.\n You told us of a Mr Pillay and a Mr Schulz who say that they did not see the child.  You stood there and said that you saw the child.  Thank you very much.",
