<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I am Tkisa Nandebi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> We thank you. Could you tell us briefly about your story. Who are you, where were you born, are you married, do you have children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I don't have any wife, I only have someone living with and we have some children. I don't have a wife, I live with someone because but I am considering her as my wife because I have got three children with her. My clan name is Tsana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Do you have one person living with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes, I have one person I am living with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Continue with your story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> My clan name is Tsana Koboyi. I was born of a fat man family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Thank you Ndebe. Could we now get into the actual matter? You say in 1995, what were your activities politically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I was a member of the Action Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> You have mentioned that you were a "General". What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> No, that was just a name I was given - that I was the General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> You continue to say, could you give us therefore a full picture of what was bothering the people at the time which led to the formation of the UDF. What were the people claiming for?  I would like to know how was the situation here in Uitenhage which led to the formation of the UDF? How were the activities politically of the residents here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> The situation was very bad here in Uitenhage because at the time of my arrival here, I joined people who were politically involved because I felt there was a call for it. One other thing is as an outgoing person I've got friends all over, even in Transkei and East London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> So what used to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I'm coming closer to what you want. I came back in July and we were going to play a match on a Sunday, so I came back on a Saturday evening. There were some other men who were in my company.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Is that just before July. In your statement you have mentioned that one of your duties as a member of the Action Committee was to discourage the operations of the Councillors. What were the names of these Councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> They were Matibesa, Mr Vena and Mr Korbega.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> There is one you have not mentioned, but you have written down in your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> They were Matibesa Kwelega, Mr Vena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What about Kinikini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> No, Kinikini did not live in Despatch, because I live in Despatch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> But in your statement you have mentioned his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> No, I am sorry if I mentioned Kinikini's name, that, I am not making a mistake, I did not mention Kinikini's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Ok. Let us continue. You say you were trying to discourage the operations of the Councillors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes. We first asked them whether they were handling people properly, why would they go to meetings and not bring a report back to the people and then we disagreed on this matter. We then decided to raid and go for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a> We first met their females and told them that, we asked them whether they say what was happening, but some of them were friends to these Councillors, some of them were scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> So, you came back in 1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes. There was a police raid and there was the day of the match Wallaby's playing against a certain rugby lot. I wasn't going to play. There is one guy from the Tsinani family that was going to play and the match was going to be very tough and they felt that he was not going to be fit to play, so I decided to play in his place, but I said to him these men are going to go round looking for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a> I was dressed in the rugby uniform and then Herber came driving a white Sierra and he went round and turned somewhere, then there was a yellow Rover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Did the match continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes, it continued and we were being beaten. I said to my co-players. One of them was Smartie Kakula. That match was really fascinating, only to find that it was going to be this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Alright, let's do it this was Ndebi. Let's now confine ourselves to the actual arrest and you had to stop playing, let's talk about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes, I am going to follow that so as not to leave out any points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> So, this ball hit the centre and he fell down and the referee was confused to an extent that he gave the points to us. I then asked our scrum half to pass on the ball and with the intention that I was going to score and I just did exactly that. It was the last time I remembered, because two people came and they held me and they said "Your name is Mpompi", then I said "No, I am not Mpompi", then they asked me to get into a hippo - and these were soldiers - and whilst in that hippo they were talking and I could see that they were talking and I said to them, they are wasting my time, I want to go and play and they said, "No, you will never again have any chance to play, we have got you", then I said "Then you don't know who you are looking for", then someone said, "You should not keep him here in this hippo" -so I gave in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a> There is one man who was clapped and fell down and I was very worried, so I handed myself over, I gave my rugby jersey to my player.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Then you were arrested Tsana. Just tell us exactly, you were arrested now, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I was in a hippo and then I was transferred into the Rover and there were two of the players, one of them, the centre and the wing who were playing in the same match and they were asked "Do you know this person?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> I was asking them not to say they were residents there and I was saying I was coming from Port Elizabeth. We were players in Port Elizabeth together and Gerts came and said the two should alight from the van. We went off, at the police station they did not put me into a cell. They put me outside and I could see if I had attempted to run away, they were going to shoot me because as a Xhosa boy there was something that I was using.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What is it that you were using?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> There was something that I was using, but this thing is not with me now, I left it in a particular Kombi. So what happened is, whilst I was there, Jimmy came, Jimmy Klaas, and . . .</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What was this Jimmy Klaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Jimmy Klaas was a Uitenhage here in, he was a resident here in Uitenhage, but he used to help the policemen to kill us. He was a businessman. All over he had businesses and he wanted to be the only business. He was a very wealthy man and he said to me "Why did you burn my shop", then I said "I didn't, you don't even know me", and then he said "No, I know who you are, you are Mpompi" - and someone confirmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a> I could hear some cars driving in, these people had come to see this person and when Gerber came, he said "So this is the Mpompi", then another foreigner from Port Elizabeth came - Faleni knows a lot about this - and he could give more information about this. He came and there were three whites with me and they were saying they were going to have a braai and I knew they were referring to me, so I asked for water - I knew this charge office very well, then I went to some place but they kicked me and they asked me "Don't you know where the tap is?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a> I wanted to make use of my things so that they should not assault me, but as I was doing that, I was clapped by Faleni, I reversed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Were you in Humansdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> No, I wasn't in Humansdorp. I was still here and I had been arrested at 5.00pm and from the police station where they were beating me they took me to a certain river and they dipped me in there. There are some roads there, when I got there, they asked me to alight from the Kombi - there were six cars there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a> I have seen some of those men who were there at the time. They are now no longer dressed in their uniform - I don't even care for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> They were there, yes, and they are here even now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Do you know their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I don't know their names, but they lived here. What happened is that, I can't understand the policemen who are here, don't do anything here, but policemen from other places come and do several things here and then it goes on like that and then if there is a parade and you want to identify the person who has assaulted you, you can't find the person and you are made a fool of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a> They asked me to undress and I said "No, I am not going to undress because it is chilly" and I had been so much exposed to cold after playing in the match. There were some of them sitting and Faleni who grew up before me, and he was one of the policemen, he is now a Lft. he was promoted because of what he did to me. He is still a policemen here in Uitenhage, he is working for the special branch. He lives in Dwessie. </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a> When I was released I saw him and he did not realise it was me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> So, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> They assaulted me. I did not undress. They tore the clothes into pieces. They put me into a white sack and they tied the top, there was a rope that they used, so they would use this rope with a hook.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a> They said to me I was going to get into this sack and I said to them "No, you are not going to put me into any water, cold as it is", so they asked me "Who were your comrades?" There was a list of names and I was the first on this list followed by Tobula Busako and next was Lulamile Tonsi, there were others like, Makiki, there must have been someone who had given these names to them, because these people did not know us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a> I told them I was not going to get into the sack, then they pushed me in by force. I took an advantage that they had handcuffed me then I decided to dive into the water and they kept me under water for some time, but I had breathed in sufficiently, then they kicked me vigorously. I was not crying, they again then dipped me into the water, I again managed but water managed to get in through the mouth and my stomach was full of water and they stamped on my stomach and water came out of my mouth and I was crying. </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a> I kept on pleading with Faleni, that "Oh, you as black as you are, why do you torture me like that?" and Faleni said - Faleni again dipped me into the water for the third time and they kept me under water for some time and I stayed there. I gave in, I was kicking in this sack and I was uncomfortable. I was trying to send a message that I couldn't breathe any longer, so they took me out and they took me out of the sack and put me outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a> I looked at where they were standing, but I was not intending to run away because there were many of them. They took out a gas stove and they had a braai as they had indicated earlier. I asked that I wanted to relieve myself and that was a mistake, they asked me to lie on this sack and they pressed me on the stomach and then water came out through all the openings - they braaied and they asked me to dress up, so what happened is that they gave me a blanket that they had got from somewhere and they covered me and put me in the back seat of the car. </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a> There were many cars driving in still - and we were driving towards town, driving to Uitenhage. It was dark, at about 8.00pm. I thought we were coming here only to find that they were on the Durban road. I could not even see anyone that I could talk to. I thought they were now going to kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a> We drove past Nboshleli location towards Rocklands and facing Jeffreys Bay. When we got to Jeffreys there was an old white man who was going to take care of me, because what they were doing is they were transferring people from one place to the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a> I still remember some people from Knysna, I would meet in Orange Free State. Whilst I was still in the van a Kombi drove and all the other cars followed. We were getting to Humansdorp and when we got to that destination, again we met another white old man who directed us to a cell and there had been a white man who had committed suicide and I could see his hair and I could not sleep. I even had to talk aloud because of fear and say "I am not responsible for your death" - I could not sleep until morning, because I was scared. This old man asked whether I was not hungry, so he bought food for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Now, let's agree you were there for a week and then they came for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> They again took me and tortured me that other side. There is a farm not far from Humansdorp - as you go down there are also some bushes and then we go round those bushes and Faleni said I should go and collect wood. I said "No, I am not going to".</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Is Faleni the only person who you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes, Faleni was the only black amongst whites. One of these white policemen was from Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a> These were the two people who were torturing me. Faleni was asked to accompany me to go and collect wood so that they could make a braai, because we were heading for Uitenhage. Then I refused, I said there is grass, there is no wood. I didn't even plead, I just refused, so they made their braai next to the Kombi, then I had my thing, I was holding it fast and I was sure they were not going to do anything to me. So, we went to the police station, that is where I was going to take an oath, before Kayamier who could see - Kayamier was a Judge in Humansdorp and the could see that I was bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Is it not Kanemeyer, or is it Kayamier? I know him very well, so you went there to take an oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes. Then I said "No, I am not going to take any oath, because I know nothing", so they said rather than you being kept in custody there are people who are going to give evidence against you, you remember that all the people in the location were arrested. I remembered that, but I was not one of those, because I had this protection that I had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> The people who were arrested on a Tuesday . . . </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> So you took an oath ultimately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I was transferred from there to Uitenhage and some of the people who were there, who were coloureds, are still here today - in this hearing - and I was sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> In what court were you sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I was sentenced in a Regional Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> Where was the sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Here in Uitenhage. I was sentenced to 23 years in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What was the charge actually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> It was a charge of a school, a hall and a beer hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> How many years did you serve out of the 23?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I served seven months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> When were you released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> I was released in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> How were you released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> We were released at the time the President was released, when the political prisoners were released. There used to be lawyers coming to us and they would ask where we came from and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> So, you are out now and you have come to the Commission. What is your wish. What do you want this Commission to do for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> My problem is that, even now, when this Kombi came to fetch us, they found me with my mother . . .</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> And what about your living-in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> No, she has got her own house now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> So, you know live with your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> Yes, but the person I live with sometimes visits me. I get some part-time jobs and some other times she sells vegetables.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What is your wish then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> It is that if you could take care of me and my children, because I have got a problem with my rib. I was on treatment, but the place were I get this treatment is very far and I don't have the money. I have got three children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">REVD. XUNDU:</span> What is the mother to the children doing and what is your mother doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLOKOLO:</span> My mother has got a pension and she is still very strong and she is mentally disturbed to an extent that people have got to take care of her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
