<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you now explain how this incident of the death of your husband affected your family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOLOMON:</span> We suffered and we were hurt.  When their father was going to a funeral, two of my children stayed behind, though they had intentions to follow.  After some time, I heard some gun shots and I was with the youngest children and I didn't know what was happening.  After some time I heard some gun shots and I stood and went outside.  I could see people were going round towards the danger light.  We ran after them and I saw two of my children crying and they were saying there was shooting and they didn't know where there father was.  So we went towards the Mitta store but we couldn't proceed.  We met some of the people who were injured coming back and we asked each other, where were the others, what had happened and we went back home and we were dissatisfied and I didn't know where my husband was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Without disturbing you,  I noticed that here in your statement you have mentioned that amongst your requests and wishes you wish that you should get some assistance so that your children could further their education so as to survive in life.  Could you expantiate on this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOLOMON:</span> Yes, that is my wish, Sir.  If their father was still alive, these children would have been successful and I would be enjoying a better life and I would be having</p>
