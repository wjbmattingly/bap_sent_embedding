<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CCHAIRPERSON:  Can we now ask Mr Fundile Lawrence Gqubule to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>take over.  Thank you Mr Nkobese.  We are going to ask the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>next witness to come forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>FUNDILE LAWRENCE GQUBULE:  (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Let me start off by making sure about some </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>details.  Do you stay in number 26 Sedidi, Khayelitsha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  At the time there was a shooting in Uitenhage </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>in 1985, were you a resident here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes, it is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What street were you staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR GQUBULE:  It was number 14 at Gunsi Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Is this Gunsi Street near this spot of </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>shooting in Maduna Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>MR GQUBULE:  No, it's not near.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  I observe that you are in a wheelchair.  Is </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>this as a result of an injury when there was a shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes, it's like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Could you explain, Mr Gqubule.  Where were you </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>on this particular day, and what actually happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MR GQUBULE:  On this day, on a Tuesday morning, I just had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>bath and I heard some freedom songs and I went out and I saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>a crowd moving toward Maduna.  Then I stood on the roof of </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>the house because I couldn't see clearly.  At the time I </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>2 G GQUBULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>was looking at Maduna, I saw a hippo that was driving </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>amongst the people as the people were standing waiting for </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>the bus.  So I saw this hippo dispersing the people.  Then </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>there were some South African Defence Force next to Maduna, </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>so I stood there watching the people who were being chased </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>and the hippo trying to disperse the people.  Then I saw a </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>group of people moving down Maduna and so I went down the </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>road and I went up Gonchi Street and next to the hall I </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>joined the crowd and we were chanting freedom songs.  There </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>was a hippo just in front of us, and it drove past and </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>stopped next to the John Wesley Church.  They were chasing </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>us.  Then that is the last I can remember because I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>heard some bullet sounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  At what stage were you hit by a bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>MR GQUBULE:  It was at Khlamthini when I was hit by a bullet </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>and I heard some shooting sounds and I felt something on my </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>right ankle and people were turning around and running and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>don't know what happened.  Then I lay there on the ground.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>I was the first person to be taken and I could see some </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>people were being shot and I could see these people lying </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>down there on the ground, they had some bottles placed on </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>their hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  When you were lying there on the ground, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I saw a helicopter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any policemen that were moving up </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>and down next to you as you were lying there on the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>MR GQUBULE:  People were being kicked and they were being </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>shot.  Some were being pulled out of the bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>3 G GQUBULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  In your statement you said there was a boy who </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>was riding a BMX bicycle, do you see that boy here now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes I do see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>MR GQUBULE:  His name is Kwanele Bucwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  You fell down and you were shot, then how did </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>you get to the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>MR GQUBULE:  As I was lying there in pain, I decided not to </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>scream because most people were being killed and were </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>screaming.  I was then put into the first ambulance together </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>with Nlungi Simclagahle and some other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Now would you say how long did this shooting </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I would say for about an hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  As you were lying there, were they still </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes, they were still shooting and people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>coming from shacks in Nimkhi who were coming to join some </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>people from section 15 and they were being shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Was there anything that was said by these </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>policemen at the time that there was shooting?  What were </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>they saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I didn't hear anything because I was really in </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>deep pain at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  How did this affect this shooting?  How did it </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>affect your body, how did it affect your health?  Is there </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>any medical treatment you are getting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>MR GQUBULE:  There is none.  What happens is when it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>overcast my body becomes stiff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Is that all you have to say Mr Gqubule, as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>what you saw on this particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>4 G GQUBULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I was transferred from the Uitenhage hospital </p>

<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>what did you see in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I saw a lot of policemen, they were all over </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>the place, inside and outside, and some people were sneaking </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>out of the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any policemen in the hospital?</p>

<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>in hospital, what did he say was the cause of the injuries </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>MR GQUBULE:  He said they had shot me on the spinal cord and </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>he said they could not take out the bullet because if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>had to do that I would be completely paralysed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Now you say, as you are sitting there, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>is a bullet that is embedded here in your body?</p>

<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes I would say that is the cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Have you ever briefed any lawyer about this </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>matter?</p>

<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I was in hospital at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  So you actually did not go to Jubilee Hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>MR GQUBULE:  No, I didn't go, it is only my parents who went </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>5 G GQUBULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  What did they say to you when they came back </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>from Jubilee Hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>MR GQUBULE:  They said to me, there were discussions with </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>the White people and they had been promised that some tax </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>would be sent to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Is there any cheque that your parents </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>MR GQUBULE:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Is there any money that was given to you for </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>this shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR GQUBULE:  There is some money I got.  Some people from </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>the bank came to me whilst I was in hospital and so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>signed, I was still in hospital at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Is that all you have to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>MR GQUBULE:  On my way from 27, I was forced to go back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>Cape Town because after I had been shot I had abscess and </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>some fluid coming out of my knees, so I had to go back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>Conradie Hospital because this left leg was giving me </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>problems and it was to be amputated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  By being here, Mr Gqubule, what is your actual </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>wish, or your request to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MR GQUBULE:  My request to this Commission is that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>should see to it that we should have some sports fields for </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>the paraplegics.  I used to be a soccer player.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Gqubule for your explanation, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>can now hand over to the Chairperson so that if any of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>colleagues here have got any questions they should pose them </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  Thank you Mr Gqubule, can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>6 G GQUBULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  How old were you when you were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MR GQUBULE:  Round about 20 something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  Mr Gqubule, we want to be able to determine </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>the impact of your injuries.  Would you please describe a </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>day in your life starting when you get up, to determine how </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>you cope on a day to day basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>MR GQUBULE:  When I wake up in the morning, I just try to </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>exercise a little bit and I take a bath.  My wife usually </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>dresses me and I have breakfast, and visit friends, nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  So it means that without the assistance and </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>support of your wife, it would be difficult for you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>function on a day to day basis, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>MR GQUBULE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  You say that you were an athlete before your </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>injuries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>MR GQUBULE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  Before your injuries, what were your dreams </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>and your plans for your future?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I was dreaming of being a sportsman and an </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>educated person, but because of the fact that we were very </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>poor and my parents and I did not have a lot of facilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  Mr Gqubule, this is a very difficult question </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>but I need to ask you.  On a day to day basis when you think </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>about what could have been, and what is now, what goes </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>through your mind, and what emotions are surfaced in you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>MR GQUBULE:  It is very painful to see myself in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>condition.  When I see other people I just think that if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>was not in this condition I was going to be somewhere else </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>just like a certain person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  Thank you, my last question.  I know you </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>UITENHAGE HEARING TRC/EASTERN CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>7 G GQUBULE</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>haven't really asked for anything, but you also say you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>not receiving treatment.  I ask again, is there anything you </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>would like the commission to take care of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>MR GQUBULE:  I would like to have a better wheelchair than </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>the one I have right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>PANEL MEMBER:  And continued medical care?</p>
