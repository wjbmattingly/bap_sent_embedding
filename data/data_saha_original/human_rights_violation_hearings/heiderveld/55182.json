Thank you Ms Javens, this is a story that is quite well known, so we'll try not to put you through too much as we ask you questions.

            "Well as Paul has said it was a very rainy day.  Just to backtrack we'd been married for 10 years and we started fellow shipping at St. James and during that time we both made commitments as Christians.  And it was one of those evenings that we went to church the normal time, started the worship service and a couple were singing\nMore than wonderful\nAnd was just at the end of that song that the doors opened and I thought it was of the wind.  And I saw this man standing there and I realised that he had a gun in his hand and he started moving from left to right.   I must have still been looking  at him without realising it.\nIn that time my husband went down on his own haunches and I realised I had better get down too.  And on going down I thought I've got to do something so I prayed that the Lord would help us.  And there was a lot of screaming and initially but even in that there was a kind of peace that I can't even now explain really.\nAnd there was different sounds I could hear and then eventually I heard a familiar voice of our Reverend  Ross Anderson just telling us to stay calm and stay down.  And this voice just kept going and I think that was incredible calming -  had a calming effect on everybody.   And after a few minutes we got up and - well I called to my husband and he didn't answer.\nAnd I got up and he was still on his haunches and I think I was a bit bewildered at that stage, everybody was milling around and with that an usher came down in front of me towards my husband.   And he bent down and obviously to him to feel his pulse and I just said to him is he alive and he shook his head.",

And she said, no maybe he is just hurt, so I said no he is dead.\nAnd in that time somebody had  straighten him out and when I looked again I just saw blood flowing from him.  But I still couldn't believe that he had died.  And then they put a sheet over him and somebody removed me to the other side of the church because they were trying to clear the church for the - just to leave those that were injured there and get the traffic cleared for ambulances and things like that.\nAnd while sitting there our Bishop arrived and the look of absolute horror on his face.  I hadn't really seen much, I believe, I believe that the Lord blinded me to what was around me. I saw a stretcher being taken out.  I realised somebody behind us had been hurt, I didn't know that he was dead, but apparently it was a Russian that had died.\nAnd it was shortly after that my son came to fetch me.  And I only - a couple of days later I was just - I was brought to the church before the funeral just to be - to feel more comfortable with it.  And it was only then that I realised the extent of what had happened for what I saw while they were cleaning up.  Holes in the carpets and blood and it was terrible.  But I can only - I can say that the only way I got through this was knowing God, he helped me through it.",

I think one of the things that one hopes can try and help is trying to make some sense out of it. As Paul said if one could understand why these things happen and also if one can see a way of moving towards a better society in which these things don't happen anymore.\nBut one of the lessons that St. James Church and community has given to the country is the way that the church and it's members rallied round all of you.  And we'll probably hear a bit more of that from Bishop Retief and Reverend Cameron.\nIs there something  - anything else you would like to say before I ask my Colleagues if they want to ask you any questions.",

I was wondering do you -  you are - I can feel that you are  in pain now and I just wanted you to share with us if there are moments when you re-experience the events whether in your sleep or in your waking life.

And I have many friends of  church family that are always there for me and really I know that I can always turn to them and they will be there.\nSo it does help me and sometime just sharing what happened makes others realised that maybe they haven't gone through something as bad and helps them through whatever they going through.",
