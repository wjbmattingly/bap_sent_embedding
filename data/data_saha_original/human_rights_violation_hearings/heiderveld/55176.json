            "Thank you Chairman - Chairperson.  Chairperson Dr Boraine has introduced to you and presented Lucas Baba Sikwepere.\nBaba is going to present to us what he says is the work of the man who came to be known as the Rambo of the Peninsula.  The police officer who is known by the name of Barnard.  Baba is going to tell us that the last time he saw with his eyes, was when he turned to look at Barnard who then blew his eyes and vision to non existence.\n Barnard has been mentioned in this room by a number of witnesses.  And if we as the Human Rights Violations Committee find that Barnard was indeed responsible for all the atrocities that are mentioned here for all the killings, the destruction of people's lives - the [indistinct]\n The total incomplete dehumanisation   of people if we find that this is true.  There are two questions that are pressing for me, the first one is wasn't there any policeman in the force in the Peninsula who could stop him in his tracks, and was our legal system so hopeless that he couldn't be brought to a Court of Law with justice.\nAnd speaking of a Court of Law, I am reminded of what a witness here on Tuesday said, Mr Juqu, Mr Juqu said in those years the Law allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do to us.  And he further said that if you were a person in authority and I will translate what he said literally.\nIf you are a person in authority, you had the right to lie in a Court of Law.  And the South African idea of a Court of Law takes us back to the 1960's, and I remember what was said by Judge De Wet in the Rivonia trial in his closing remarks.\nHe first of all dismissed the expert testimony of Dr Allan Patten and said that he was in no way convinced that President Mandela and Others were trying to improve the lives of the oppressed in apartheid South Africa.  JP de Wet also said that just as a way of explaining to everybody what the Courts then were doing, he said that the function of the Courts is to enforce the Laws of the States.  And to enforce law and order.\nNow it is our function here as the Human Rights Violations Committee to try and establish what Barnard's idea of the enforcement of law and order was.  And to establish the extends and nature of that enforcement of law and order.\nBaba, you can take off your earphones.  Good morning, I am just going to explain to you how this house is arranged.  If you face towards your right, that is now the whole house, you are now seated on the platform, people in this house are approximately 200 to 250.  You are now seated on the platform.  And our small tables are arranged as a horse shoe.  Right in the middle of  the horse shoe is Bishop Tutu, next to him is Dr Boraine, I am right at the extreme end of this horse shoe.  I am seated directly across you, we are facing each other.  We are now going to start to talk to each other, Baba.\nCould you please tell us Baba what happened on that day of this incident, could you please explain to us.",

            "On this particular day it was on - in the morning we were told that the previous night that we shouldn't sleep at night, because we were going to be attacked.  Now the community at large was told by a loudspeaker to stay outside the whole night -  that night.  Now the following day I left and I went to find out if my house was still there.  Before an hour was over while I was still at - in my house, I - I heard that we were called.  \nAnd I heard that we are now being attacked.  I ran, we were - I went through the Terminus Road.  Now that was where we were suppose to collect each other.  Now that place was between Crossroads and KTC.   While we were still there, a van approached - it was a white van and it was driven by Barnard.  When he - after he had just passed, he asked us to all disperse within five minutes.  People asked how can - how can he ask us to - to disperse because we are not here to do any harm.  Only people who are suppose too - who are here to burn the place should be dispersed.",

            "Yes I can.  Now when the communities asked how can he ask us to disperse because this is just a small meeting, we were just 20 to 25.  We were here to elect people and we were just asking how can he ask this of us.  We elected 3 people, one of them was Vulelo Schoto we use to call him Bullet, I can't remember the name of the third one.  I was the fourth one, but I wasn't elected.\nI wanted to find out what was the response from this white man.  That time he had already turned towards Nyanga East.  On his way back from Nyanga East he was facing KTC now.  Now that's when now we were told now this three elected men must go and represent us.  When I saw that the van now was stationary, I went to it.  They checked if the person driving the car was the one that they were looking for - they found that no it wasn't him.\nI was just standing for two minutes next to the window, I found out now - now this white man opened the door and withdraw his gun.  Now I wanted to find out what is the story going on, on the other side of this car.  I tried to peep and I was looking straight into him, straight to him.  When - while I was still looking at him, these people asked him, how can you ask us to disperse, and yet we have no aims to do harm to anyone.  We are here to stop whoever who is trying to burn this place up.  \nThis white man said this in Afrikaans - you are going to get eventually what you looking for.  And I am going to shoot you.  I was shocked at what this white man said to him, to me.  He said in Afrikaans, I am going to get you.  Now I wanted to find out why is he talking to me like this.  And I was just trying to find out was he referring to me by all these, and one - one of the men behind me ran.  I saw this people surrounding this van - I was now wondering when - where do these people come from surrounding this van, all of a sudden.\nAfter I saw this running men, now I didn't even care about this one, I was talking to.  After that I heard a loud noise, it sounded like a stone hitting a sink, now it - it ended up looking now I was going to be included among these people surrounding this van.  But I decided not to run, I decided to walk.  Because I knew that if you run, you were going to be shot, so I decided let me just walk into a safe place where I can just start now running.  But during that time shootings were going on, there were two white men in this car.\nBarnard was not driving at that time,  now when I - when I arrived at the place when I thought now I am safe, I felt something hitting my cheek.  I couldn't go any further, I stayed right there only to find out I had been hidden by a corner of a house.  I felt my eyes itching, I was just itching my eyes, I was scratching my eyes I wasn't quite sure what happened to my eyes at that particular time.  I felt somebody stepping on my right shoulder.\nAnd saying I thought this dog has died already.  I felt both my eyes -  I was just waiting that these people are going to take me to a prison  end of Tape 19, side A ... during that whole time - after saying is this man dead or not, some people picked me up.  Only to find out they were taking me into a private car, now that's the car that took me to the hospital.  That's where I spend a month, after I came back I still stayed in misery.\nThe same white man still tried to torture me, another night this white man came again.  They came to fetch me and I was staying that time with my girl friend.  When I got to where the Casspir was going, it was Nyanga East at the police station.  That's where they really beat me up so much that they said I was the organiser of all these riots.\nI was worried, tried to think where were they taking me, they emphasized all - they were concentrating on me, most of the time, they took me to the cemetery.   I was with Lulama  Magoje and she was the one who was holding my hand.  And they pushed me into a hole and they were - I was told to tell the truth even if you could die here now, nobody would know anything.",
