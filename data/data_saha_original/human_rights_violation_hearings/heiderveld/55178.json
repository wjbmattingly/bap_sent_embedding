He went to the fish shop to go and buy fish for the other children still at home.\nWhen he returned apparently there was a box in the road and he bent down to pick it up and he was shot with an FN rifle.  And I then asked my employer to take me home.  And I went to the scene where the incident happened.  When I arrived there the ambulance was there already and I wanted to climb into the ambulance, but they told me no, you can't get in because he is already dead.\nBut in Hanover Park  Avenue is a Catholic Church and the priest  stood there and he was also praying.  And the priest offered me a lift to the hospital.  He first said where are you taking the child and they said to Victoria Hospital.  And he stayed in Victoria Hospital for a whole year, he underwent eight operations.\nAnd what they did he was on a respirator and  they had to keep him alive artificially and after a year, he was discharged from hospital - no before he was discharged from hospital Dr Liebenberg told me that the whole in his stomach could not be repaired because if they were to repair it, he'd die and then.  I then transferred him to Groote Schuur Hospital and there they performed  the ninth  operation on him and repaired the whole in his stomach.\nAnd subsequently  a policeman came to me and apologised for having shot the child.  He said he was very sorry, this is one from the Philippi police station, he said that he also had a wife and children and that he was very sorry that he had shot him with the FN rifle.  Before he was discharged from Victoria Hospital, a couple of policeman arrived and they said that he had to go to Pollsmoor prison, so I went to the doctor, the doctor said no, he is far to ill he is in intensive care he simply can't go to Pollsmoor prison in any event, then I took him to Groote Schuur and there they did the ninth operation.\nAnd when he was discharged I received a summons that he had to go to Court.  He appeared in Court and we were in the - sitting in the courtroom, the Magistrate said to him look you've already endured your punishment it's not necessary for us to sentence you because you've already had your punishment.  And that's how it happened that I moved from Hanover Park to Mitchell's Plain.",
