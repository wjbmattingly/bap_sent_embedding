And the period is 1985, and that was a period of great conflagration in the communities here.\nYou will recall that yesterday you were told the very sad story of the killing of Fuzile Petros Juqu who was killed on the 19th of February.  And the event that you are about to hear was part of those conflicts which in a large measure was part of at that particular point in time, by yet a desire by the apartheid Government to enforce upon an unwilling public one of their policies of [indistinct] of our country.  \nThis particular instance was when they had decided that large communities of people should be removed from Crossroads, Guguletu to Khayelitsha a waste land about 50 kilometres from Cape Town.\nOur research department have in fact provided a very useful background again it was the [indistinct] of yet another Minister of State of the apartheid Government, Dr Viljoen who ironically was called Minister of Co-Operation and Development, who had announced that extra staff and transport were to be supplied to speedup preparations for the removal of residents of Crossroads to Khayelitsha.\nWhen the people resisted, and he had been told that this would be so, the apartheid machinery answered in the only way they knew how by unleashing their killing machine on a protesting public.  Yet again people had to die, people had to be manned, people had to be injured in pursuit of a mad indefensible police.\nNomatise's story is an illustration of that madness for which unfortunately the cost again was very high.  She'll show you injuries that she sustained horrifying injuries but there are injuries which she will not  be able to show you, because of the delicate place where they are located.",

So I asked them to give me a free ticket for the bus.  Nobody answered me there, so that was the last time I went for that treatment.  From there I went to Kwa-Noxolo Clinic where I - I use to pay R0,50 and sometimes I wouldn't have the R0,50 and I will stay at home then.\nNow because my mother was working, he use to bring me Betadine from her work and I use to use it as treatment.  The boers kept on coming at my place but luckily for me, they would come at a time when I am not in.  And I left and I went to stay at Crossroads.  \nMy mother told me not to stay there, because the boers will know where I am and would come and search for me.  So she told me to go and - to go home to King Williams Town.  So I left around October.  Then I came back in June 1986 and they were again riots at Crossroads.
