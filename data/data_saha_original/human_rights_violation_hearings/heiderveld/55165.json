            "Anton Lubowski was my only son, he was raised in the spirit of opposition politics against apartheid. His father stood as a candidate in three election in South West Africa against the National Party. Anton completed his high school training at Paul Roos in Stellenbosch and then underwent one year military training in Pretoria as a lieutenant. Then he did a BA in Law at Stellenbosch University and completed that. He completed his LLB at the University of Cape Town.\n Anton was a child of God and the courage which I received over the past couple of years, to carry on with life, I've found in the same source every single Sunday I listen to the radio church service with Anton's Bible on my lap. I know how much solace he has left me by underlining certain important verses in the Bible. And the verse which he left with me, and underlined for today comes from Romans 8 verse 31, what can we say of these things if God is for us, who can be against us.\n Right from the first day that he started at Lawrence and Bone in Windhoek, a firm of attorneys he was thrown into the deep end. He had to visit SWAPO awaiting trial prisoner in prison, the gruesome torture which this man had undergone so distressed Anton that he was physically ill after that.  That was the start of numerous cruel actions that he suffered at the hands of the Security Police. I, his mother, I knew how much empathy he had with his fellow human beings and I understood what it did to his psyche and his soul.\n He decided to go to the Bar earlier as an advocate 60% of his cases were of a political nature and he defended SWAPO supporters. One again this brought him into very close contact with unbelievable stories of torture by the Security Forces in the police. SWAPO men who just disappeared overnight without a trace, torture in police cells and detention which shocked him to his core.\n There was also the case of an Ovambo women who had to stand against the wall for hours and hours she had her monthly period and the blood ran down her swollen legs. These kind of things nearly broke his spirit. He became more and more outspoken and took up a strong point - point of view against the authorities and apartheid legislation.\n All these things of course made him a marked man. In 1984 he joined SWAPO openly and that was the start of his road to tragedy filled with unbelievable pain and suffering, not only for him but also for his wife and his children and his loved ones.\n In a local newspaper in Windhoek he was warned about what was waiting for him. Anton - Anton now you'll know what hell on earth is, you'll know what it's like to walk down the street and to know that eyes are following you. You are now the inmate of the outer sphere of hell and particular darkness, you're a marked man. Thereafter his life was constantly in danger, he had threatening calls frequently.\n His wife and children were also warned that he had only hours to life. Pamphlets depicting his head full of bullet wounds were received in the post, other pamphlets showing his head covered in this most filthy language in Afrikaans were also received. If I may show you an example [intervention]",

            "SWAPO you're out, you are filth, you are worst than the excrement of a snake, you piece of filth, you communist, away with you, kaffir boetie, you are going to die, you filth. You are no good, pig head, and child of a hoar.\n He had fewer and fewer cases to defend, he was a social outcast as if he had some kind of a contagious disease. He was openly cursed as a white kaffir and sometimes he rather enjoyed that. One evening when he came back from Khatature where he had gone to take food to poor black people just outside Windhoek he was shot at.\n He immediately went to the police and showed them the evidence, his window had been shot at, but the police just ignored him, they turned their backs on him.\n He was thrown into prison with 23 SWAPO members because he had also protested against the unjust laws, once again he gained first hand experience of the terrible conditions in prison, no toilet facilities, squat closets in the ground. And to wash there was only a hole over this water closet and there was a stream of water jetting out onto it and of course this was the kind of conditions where diseases flourished. Mielie pap three times a day, and this was brought to them in a wheelbarrow and they were served end of Tape 14, side B ... [indistinct] in solitary detention.\n The questions they put to him there they could of also put to him in his advocate's rooms, he was clothed only in a pair of underpants, he had one blanket and the Bible ironically enough. They wanted to break him because he was a threat to the National Party Government in South West Africa as well as abroad because he had become known in many countries as a fighter against apartheid.\n He was hated for his background, his academic achievements as well as his status. With an Afrikaner mother, a German father, both from respected families and backgrounds, that they could not abide. Namibia's independence was already afore comple Resolution 435 was a reality.\n SWAPO's white boy a huge threat. The disciples of Satan the beast. As from the 1st of September 1989 started planning his assassination in Johannesburg and in Pretoria. Thousands of rands which were taxpayers money was made available and this is the hardest thing of all to swallow that we paid to have our son killed.\n The instruction for the assassination was given to\nStaal Burger\nChappie Marais\nFerdi Barnard\nKalla Botha\nSlang van Zyl\nWouter Basson\nDonald Acheson a professional hit man.\n After everything that I've now told you no normal person can believe that my son Anton Lubowski, could ever have become a spy for the National Party Government as national - as Magnus Malan alleged in Parliament.\n I am requesting the Commission to help us to take away the hindrances, so that our child's murders can be triad in a Court of Law. The assassination was planned here in South Africa by Afrikaners and was committed in Namibia when it was still under South African jurisdiction.\n I conclude by explaining why I wrote the book Anton Lubowski, paradox of a man, in English. The reason for that was that because Anton was so well known abroad I wanted to show the world how low the National Party had stooped with their illegal occupation in Namibia.\n He lived when a political crimes were a mask for the so-called Christian country and Government to commit their atrocities. The hatred which was almost tangible because you wanted to promote justice, evoke the feeling that his death led to the lancing of this boil.\n I would like to use this opportunity to thank the Truth Commission from the bottom of my heart that they have given us this privilege and I would like to thank the people of Cape Town - my pastor Dr Ben Kotze, who supported me for six years. All the many Afrikaans people who did not want to carry on living as before, it doesn't matter to which political party they belonged, thank you very much.",

He was also a high profiled and very well-know member of the South West African Peoples Organisation known as SWAPO.\nAnton established himself as a fighter in the Namibian Liberation Struggle and at great personal sacrifice fought fearlessly for that cause. As and advocate he was involved in a large number of so-called terrorist cases, he however, also took a leading part in the political struggle.\nHe addressed meetings and marched with demonstrators. He represented SWAPO in 1984 at the Peace Summit in Lusaka and announced his membership of SWAPO encouraging other white people to follow his example. He was soon detained by the Security Police and in all detained six times including a time in solitary confinement in 1987 until he was released after the application was brought to the Supreme Court in South West Africa.\nIt is a fact that for many years Anton had been harassed by the authorities of the day in Namibia. The assassination of Anton took place during the transitional period in Namibia that is Resolution 435 of the United Nations was being implemented there.\nThe United Nations Transitional Assistance Team known as UNTAG, was from the 1st of April 1989 actively deployed inside the country occupying military bases and monitoring certain police activity.\nAn election which would be free and fair was to be held in the terms of Resolution 435. This election was scheduled for November 1989, a few months after the assassination of Anton. The day after the assassination...\nExcuse me may I have a glass of water?",

            "The day after the assassination of Anton, namely the 13th of September 1989, an Irish nation one Donald Acheson was arrested in regard to murder. Acheson was a hardened soldier who served in the Rhodesian Army and possibly also in the South African Defence Force. Acheson appeared in the High Court of Namibia charged with murder on the 18th of April 1990.\nThe Prosecutor-General advocate Hans Heyman, however, applied for a postponement of the case and for Acheson to be remanded in custody. The postponement was sought on the basis that the Prosecutor-General wanted to join two co-accused in the case who were both South African citizens but that were various difficulties in securing their attendance at the trial in Windhoek.\nThe Court granted postponement of the matter until the 7th of May 1990 in order to enable Prosecutor to produce evidence of the diplomatic initiatives which were taken to procure the attendance in Court of the said two persons. The prosecution could not produce any such evidence on the postponement date - postponed date and the charge of murder was consequently withdrawn against Acheson.\nIt is, however, rumoured that the police were involved in the murder. These rumours persisted until a local newspaper The Namibian published an article on the 17th of May 1993 which contained allegations by a former Namibian policeman one Willem Rooinasie, concerning police involvement in the assassination.\nThis resulted in a renewed investigation by the Namibian police and an eventual inquest into the death of Anton which was conducted in the High Court of Namibia by Mr Justice Harold Levy.\nThe inquest ran during the period April to June 1994. The Court eventually made it's findings on the 23rd of June 1994. As more fully appears from various extracts from the inquest findings of Mr Justice Levy, Anton's death was attributed to being shot seven times on various parts of his body with an AK47 rifle and a final shot through the head with a different calibre firearm.\nIn other words they wanted to make quite sure. The Court found that Acheson had executed the assassination on the instructions of the Division of the South African Defence Force known as the Civil Co-operation Bureau, also known as CCB.\nThe inquest findings also rejected the allegation, which was made by the then South African Minister of Defence ex General Magnus Malan, in the South African Parliament on the 26th of February 1990, and repeated in evidence by one of the witnesses at the inquest, Willem Rooinasie, namely that Anton was an agent of the South African Defence Force.\nIt is clear that the investigation into the assassination of Anton was plaques by misinformation, obfuscation, subterfuge and lies in order to conceal the fact that the assassination was planned and executed under direct orders from the CCB.\nEven the conduct of the prosecuting authorities of Namibia was clearly irregular and was severely criticised by Mr Justice Levy insofar as the prosecution of Acheson was concerned.\nExtracts from the inquest findings are annexed to this affidavit, I got them here in front of me, clearly setting out the background to the assassination and the manner in which it was eventually handled by both the Namibian police and the prosecuting authority.\nThe assassination and subsequent defamatory allegations made against Anton has been a tremendous blow to our whole family but particularly the family of Anton and his good name and memory.\nI require from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to fully investigate the assassination in order to finally expose those responsible and to restore the good name and memory of Anton.\nIt would also be appreciated if the Commission could consider the possibility of assistance for the family of Anton who has lost a breadwinner, husband and father.",
