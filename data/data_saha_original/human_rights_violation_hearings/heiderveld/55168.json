I was fetched by my sister-in-law he was his - with her husband, they told me that I am being wanted at home.  I was quite shocked to see them.\n I asked them is there anything that happened they didn't tell me anything, they just took me.  Then we went to Guguletu.  I didn't go straight home, because my home is also in the same vicinity.  My sister-in-law took me to his - to her house.  I tried to ask them what exactly happened here, they didn't tell me.  We went home instead, when I got there, I found out that it was full of people and my father was on his feet and he was telling people what was - what had happened.\n That's when I realised that somebody has died, but I thought - I didn't see anyone - I haven't seen all of them but I could see that my father was alive.  He was telling other people that he was just resting on a Sunday.  And Ginana was sent to the shop by one of the neighbours to buy cigarettes and matches.  Ginana bought all these things from the shop.  When he was getting out of the shop somebody snatched him - a man.  He tried to free himself because he was snatched quite roughly.  He asked him what have I done, why you snatching me like this, no he didn't reply, this man.\n A woman from no 81, no 21 Ms Johnny that is her name, asked this man what has this child done, but the man didn't say anything.  But he went up the street with him, the street that leads to 83.  This woman tried to free my brother from this man, while my brother wanted to free himself, and this man took something from his waist only to find out it was a gun.  Then my brother managed to free himself.  He stepped back, no he didn't run, he was stepping back, he - this man shot him the first time on his chest.  And my brother asked what have I done, he shot him again the second time but he missed.  Now that bullet went straight to no 8.\n My father heard the first shot, he heard the second shot too.  And now he could see now his son coming approaching the house.  He got up and said isn't that my son, falling down there.  Then my father shouted no that is my son, leave him alone.  The shot went again on this - on the third shot my brother fell down.  Then my father threw himself over - over my - over my brother.\n My brother was asking what have I done and this man was still standing over him and he still wanted to shoot but now he ran out of bullets and he was pointing at my brother's head.  The police van arrived and this man got into the - into the van - then it's then that we realised that this man after all is a policeman, even though he was in a civilians clothes, so he left.   They left my brother lying there on the ground.  My father tried to get transport to take my brother to the police station, but he didn't get it.  He tried to get other means.  When my father got back the neighbours had already taken my brother away, the whole street was out - try to help.\n So when my father came in, the neighbours had already taken my brother to the police station, so my father followed to the police station.  When he got there, he found that my brother was on - on a chair, on a bench.  He held his hand, my father could see that he was already dead.  He closed his eyes and then my father fainted right there in the police station.",

The people who were now running away from him, so according to The Times he was defending himself from gangsters and according to The Times this policeman shot these people at the back which we both know that it is not true, because my brother was shot on the chest.\n And now his clothes were sent to Pretoria, that's what we were told when we wanted to see the evidence that he was really shot from the front or the back.  Now we were told that no his clothes were in Pretoria we can't get them.\n My father went to Court several times, going to Court in connection with this case.  The lawyer in charge of this case who was with my father told my father that - this case was going to be transferred to the Supreme Court.  Now you must wait, now my father waited, and nobody came back to him again with any report.  He was also promised that after he has buried his son he was going to get compensation from the police.  But he never got anything.\n When my father asked his lawyer - asking him how long am I going to wait, the lawyer said - the lawyer said he was scarred himself that no this case is going to be dismissed but he was scared to tell him the actual reason because it seemed that the Government itself wanted the case to be dismissed.  The Government didn't want this case to be announced - to be know by everybody.   So we never got any - anything - we didn't get his clothes, we didn't get anything.\n My father left to the rural areas, we use to live in Cape Town but because of this my father decided to go and leave Cape Town because living in Cape Town was just too painful for him.

And I saw the kids passing - jumping the gate at no 11 at the back, at the backyard.\n Now this man left also, I closed my door.  I hear noise outside, when I looked outside, I saw this man, at that time I didn't know that he was a policeman.  So I saw this man dragging Ginana by the neck from no 16 which is now opposite my own house.  He dragged him and Ginana was asking what have I done, what have I done and his hands were up.  And he was holding tobacco and matches.  Ginana was walking backwards, leaning against the fence of no 16, this man shot Ginana the first time and he shot him in the chest.\n The second bullet went through but it - it missed Ginana and - no - no he slipped and he fell on his back and he asked what have I done, and this man stood over him and asked - and shot him again.  He tried again to shoot, and then at that time now Ginana's father appeared saying no that is my son, that is my son.\n It was at that time now when the van approached us, it was rushing and this policeman inside this van asked what - why have you shot this one.  And then he said hey I've shot this one, but let's run away, so he got into the van and ran away with the van.  Ginana's father asked, looked for transport to take Ginana, but he couldn't and then some of the neighbours took Ginana to the police station.",
