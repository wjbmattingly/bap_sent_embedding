We are enormously grateful to the Central Methodist Church, its presiding minister and his staff for availing us of the facilities of this beautiful church and all. Thank you very much Mr Mvume.\n Thank you to the Police and Security personnel.  They have in the other venues done a splendid job of work and we believe that that is going to be the case here as well.  Thank you also to the traffic cops.\n An especially warm welcome to those who will be testifying before the Commission and their families.  Thank you for your generosity of spirit and your courage in exposing yourselves to the gaze of the world.  We have kept saying this in the other venues.  It is not an easy thing to do revealing your pain, your hurt and your trauma to the scrutiny of others.  We have heard some harrowing accounts in East London and King Williamstown.

On the contrary they want to know the truth so that they should know whom they should forgive.\n We pray that all who hear will be inspired to be equally generous in response to such extraordinary magnanimity.  Only in such mutuality will healing happen.\n We have been disturbed and distressed that some have been accusing us of alleged unfairness because we have not apparently given alleged perpetrators enough notice. Let me make two points.\n Firstly, we are acting in terms of the legislation that has brought us into being and I want to quote from the Act for the Promotion for National Unity and Reconciliation and it's section 30.\n\"If, during any investigation by or hearing before the Commission, any person is implicated in a manner which may be to his detriment, the Commission,\n(b) contemplates making a decision which may be to the detriment of a person who has been so implicated,\n (c) it appears that any person may have suffered harm as a result of the gross violation of human rights,\n the Commission shall, if such person is available, afford him or her an opportunity to submit representations to the Commission within a specified time with regard to the matter under consideration.  Or...\"\nnot \"and\",\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

            "GAUTENG",
            "4\n\"...to give evidence at a hearing of the Commission\".\n That section of the Act does not stipulate when perpetrators should be given notice.  We have been generous, and I want to underline that, we have been generous in letting them know ahead of a hearing.  It is in our discretion, after they have made their representations whether we invite them then to a hearing and also that they may then have opportunity for limited cross-examination.  That is laid down in the Act which was passed by a democratically elected Parliament, in which all parties are represented.  If people have problems, it must be directed not at the Commission but at the Assembly which passed the law.\n Secondly, we have taken a principled decision that victims, survivors will be accorded the opportunity to tell their stories.  Most have not had such an opportunity before.  Again this is a requirement in the Act that in its preamble says, \"affording victims an opportunity to relate the violations they suffered\".\n The Act lays down that there must be a bias in favour of the victims and the survivors, and I am not plucking this out of the air.  It is in the Act again. \"Principles to govern actions of Commission when dealing with victims\", section 11.\n\"When dealing with victims the actions of the Commission shall be guided by the following principles.\na. Victims shall be treated with compassion and respect for their dignity.\n b. Victims shall be treated equally and without\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

Procedures for dealing with applications by victims shall be expeditious, fair, inexpensive and accessible.\n d. Victims shall be informed through the Press and any other media of their rights on seeking redress through the Commission\".\nBut in fact this bias works to the advantage of perpetrators.  Almost all who have testified thus far have amazed us, have amazed the world with their willingness to forgive. They want not to revenge themselves against perpetrators.  They are not looking for retribution, but quite remarkably they do want to forgive.  Some, even more extraordinarily say we have already forgiven them, Mrs Savage in King Williamstown, the people who testified in Cape Town from St James Massacre.\n Our credentials as champions of human rights, of justice, of fairness and reconciliation should not be in dispute.  They are a matter of public record.  We oppose an evil and vicious system which denied a very large part of our society fundamental human rights.  Those, especially in the security establishment, whether they intended it or not, were defending an evil system which did not accord people their rights.  We succeeded in our struggle so that today even those who defended that awful system could today claim constitutional and other human rights.  It is precisely because of our record as fighters for justice and human JOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

What they need is grace, the grace of forgiveness, and I hope that they too will have the graciousness to acknowledge that they are sorry.\n It is a matter of public record that we are independent.  We have not been afraid to criticise even the new ANC led government of National Unity to the amazement of many.  In this Commission in all three hearings that have taken place so far, or the two and you will note here, we have heard and we will hear accounts of human rights violations right across the political spectrum.  In East London we had people who were the victims of an alleged APLA atrocity.  In East London we heard from victims of bombing in Highgate Hotel.  In Cape Town we heard someone come to speak on behalf of a necklacing victim, necklaced allegedly by so-called activists.  Here we are going to be hearing from victims of the so-called Church Street bombing in Pretoria.\n People have said this Commission will degenerate into a witch hunt.  Far from this being the case we have hardly paid attention to the perpetrators.  Last week in Cape Town one of the witnesses claims she recognised a police officer who was on the scene when her daughter was killed, and she broke down.  Now if we wanted to engage in a witch hunt we would have immediately rushed out to apprehend that police officer.  We did nothing of the sort because our concentration, and I want to underscore this, our\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

We hope that people coming before the Amnesty Committee will be the ones who are going to provide us with most of the information we require.\n I appeal to those who may be aware they were perpetrators willingly or involuntarily to respond to the incredible generosity and magnanimity of victims with a matching generosity.  Don't try to do the impossible. Don't try to defend the indefensible.  There will be no gloating.  If some, like the Dominie whose letter I read in Cape Town could get up and say \"sorry\", they would be overwhelmed by the response of the victims, of the survivors, of this foul, of this evil, of this vicious system.  \n I am grateful to have received a copy of a resolution taken by the Dutch Reformed Churches' body between the sessions of its conferences where it says,\n\"We accept that some of the perpetrators and victims of gross human rights violations come from the ranks of the churchgoers, the Dutch Reformed church-goers.  We offer you our assistance and to those who apply to appear in front of the Commission regarding these applications.  We accept responsibility to assist these people by means of counselling and to help them to be healed from the trauma of the past, and to offer the reconciliation that Christ has offered us.  We are appealing to all our churches and church bodies by means of its official mouthpiece to assist this counselling service with devotion and commitment\".\n... to the NG Kerk for that.  \n The Media, as I have observed before, have excelled \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

There are some whose conduct is less than commendable, particularly certain newspapers.  Some have already been reprimanded by the Honourable Judge presiding in the so-called Malan trial, e.g. for calling in question the credibility of witnesses.  I am myself and out-and-out libertarian and believe in the freedom of the Press, passionately.  I strove for it.  But I am concerned that some of what certain papers are doing is beyond the limits of proprietary of fair comment.  They are introducing an insidious poison, they are almost seeking to bring the Commission into disrepute.   We have powers vested in us by the law.  I would advise journalists and their editors to acquaint themselves with this Act.  In certain respects we have the powers of a court of law.  And again let me read, so that you don't think I am making it up. Section 39 reads,\n\"If any person does anything in relation to the Commission which if done in relation to a court of law would constitute contempt of court then they are guilty of an offence.  If anyone does anything calculated improperly to influence the Commission in respect of any matter being or to be considered by the Commission that person commits an offence\"\nI have said I don't want to invoke any of those powers, but I do hope that the newspapers especially will take count of what I have said.  There is a nobility of spirit in our land and we must give thanks to God for this extraordinary spirit, this wonderful \"ubuntu\".  \n These hearings are a forum in which people who have \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

The recovery, helping people to recover their human and civil dignity. \n The Commission will not be making a finding immediately whether such persons are victims of gross violations of human rights.  That will happen a little later.  The testimony given enjoys the same privilege as if it were given in a court of law, and we have already indicated what is the case with that to the naming of alleged perpetrators.  If a witness deliberately gives the Commission false testimony then he or she will be guilty of an offence as will be the case in a court of law.  This is not a court of law, but we know you will conduct yourselves with proper decorum.  As I have said I hope we will not need to invoke the powers vested in us.  \n We want to thank all who have prayed for us, who are praying for us.  We receive quite a few letters, but we've received one or two that I want to refer to.  One is a fax from a Church in Harlem, the Church of the Intercession who assure us of their prayers.  But even more wonderfully is a letter from a junior youth group in Mitchell's Plain.  The letter says,\n\"Our programme focused on our present renew theme, the Cost of being a disciple within the Community, and the children needed to identify how they could be instrumental in our community by trying to turn bad news into good news, and while we were looking through the past weeks' newspapers we noticed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and how you are trying to do just that, healing the wounds of\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/",

It wasn't even a year.  The school closed and they reopened and I saw him coming home.  He was together with another one, it was his companion that I don't know and he said to me Mamma they expelled me again from school.  And I asked him again why have you been expelled?  No they just said I should get out of the school, I will teach my fellow schoolmates wrong information.  That was the last day I saw my son.  I never saw him again.

Most unfortunately he didn't manage to complete all the tasks because just after his graduation he died.  Well I am left alone with his younger brothers and sisters.  While Omgepotsi was still at school I tried to send the one coming after him to school.  I sent him to Thaba Nchu, well he sent the certificate as well, even now the certificate has not come back.  Well after leaving his brother died.  He had a problem with his eyes and he cried a lot and he cannot see now.  He doesn't see clearly, he has children, two of them, they are my responsibility.  Two children are left behind.  I am sick as you see me, I am wearing these glasses because I can hardly see.  I am not crippled, I wasn't born this way.  There were stairs at work and I used to fall because I would think of many things. Well that's how my legs were paralysed in this way.  I went to doctors and they told me that I have had a heart attack and I have arthritis.  These are the problems. Well there are so many problems that I can tell the Commission, can you help me with ideas you know of searching who killed my son and maybe help me in this life, if it were possible.   Because if I try to gather some money to take children to the doctors there is a shortage of money.  I don't have medical aid because I am not working.  I was working in the kitchens.
