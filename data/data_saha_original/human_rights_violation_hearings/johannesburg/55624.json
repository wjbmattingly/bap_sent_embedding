At the moment we can see that you are very tired, but maybe before I talk to you I think it is necessary to remind you, the Commission and those people who are here, especially from the time when you started being harassed.\n On 30 March 1960 a state of emergency was passed.  The Act gave the Minister of Law and Order, Commissioner of the SAP, a magistrate or a commissioned officer the power to detain any person where in their opinion this was desirable for reasons of public safety.  It allowed detention without trial and it authorised any commissioned officer to detain without a warrant any person suspected of political activities and to hold them without access to a lawyer for 90 days.  Under this legislation we have been told that you are one of the first people in South Africa to serve the 90 days in detention. \n Having said that I would like you to greet the Commission and tell them about yourself and your life that led you to be one of the first people to be detained.",

            "I greet the Commission.  My story is quite long and so much that in the 1960 affairs I wouldn't be able to give you the dates, it's quite long.  As you see this is my last born. It's quite long.  But then the reason that got me into jail it was the Sharpeville affairs.\n We went to Orlando Police station to protest against the innocent children and women who were shot and killed at Sharpeville.  I remember very well it was a few days, few months after Verwoerd had ordered ten Saracens, and those \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 P HLONGWANE\nvery ten Saracens were used in Sharpeville to mow down people.  So we were busy campaigning and fighting against the influx and pass laws.  So we decided to protest and we got to Orlando East.  Thereafter we were locked in.\n In fact we were the first to be sentenced for three years.  Before that it was three months with the defiance campaign, two months, so forth.  We got to Leeuwkop where we dug sand and all that.  Now in this final sentence we were 300, three years option of 300, 300 ...(indistinct).  We were together with Robert Sebuko.  He's the first man to get that severe punishment.  We were sentenced to hard labour.  We had to go to Pretoria ...(indistinct) for classification because we were over one or two years.  From there transferred to Stone Yard where we lost one of our men who was a carpenter.  Well he died due to food which was not correct for him.\n In the meantime for six months we were at Stone Yard preparing to be transferred to a destiny which was Stoffberg where we had to build and dig a lake which was 75 feet deep.  I remember one of our men there, the late Mr Mtuping who was bitten by a snake whilst we were in prison.  And what we required seeing that we were sentenced, we wanted to improve the life of prisoners in jail.  We ordered many - you know in the first place we wanted prison regulations and we were punished for demanding prison regulations because the food was not normal, it was inhuman, and sleeping we would sleep on concrete with mats that people use outside for cleaning their feet. So life was really unbecoming.\n At one stage whilst we were digging that heavy dam the White warders from Free State, all over, were summoned to come and ill-treat us or thrash us with pick handles.  We \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 P HLONGWANE\ncall that battle, it was the Battle of Pick.  We got, some of them unfortunately, the people who were badly hurt, they are now late.  Now that is the first instance which I wouldn't embark on it for a long time.  We did our sentence.  By the way during that period Sebuko Robert number four, he wrote a letter with a toilet to Kwame Nkrumah appealing to him to send us 45,000 pounds by then.  And then Verwoerd declared a state of emergency.  So the money was transferred to Basutoland, to Msimghtele.  All the same we had to continue with our sentence up to the last.",

You would only get water from ...(indistinct) which would really make you sick, because it would take you about two or three days having one meal which was what do you call it, (speaks Zulu) spoilt mealies, there was no ...(indistinct) whatsoever.  When you would complain they would tell you that look you're a prisoner, yours is to serve or die.  We were in a maximum term, no privileges whatsoever.\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 P HLONGWANE\n Then we finished our sentence, three years.  Well fortunately we didn't lose our men, we only lost one man at Stone Yard.  Right, we were released after finishing our sentence which carried another three years suspension.  \n We were hardly back, hardly two or three months, we were again rounded up and detained.  It was the beginning of 90 days.  It started with us because of the incident that took place at the Cape ...(indistinct), something like that, you see.  We were rounded up and detained.\n If you remember well Goldreich the lawyer, advocate was dealing with our case.  Unfortunately he had to skip and the way he skipped he acted as a minister, Anglican minister with cassocks and all that.  He went to Swaziland. Okay.  The detention took a year.  Eventually we were released, but in between they would pick us and detain us so much that I didn't have time to go and work or be employed.  I only survived because of the knowledge I got from school doing carpentry or building.  I don't know if that is sufficient for 1960?",

            "That is the second issue.  Well in 1987 we actually saw that there was chaos going on in the township.  Our children could not go to school.  Hooligans took an upper hand in so to say police became their sweethearts.  So we formed what we called a street committee.  Children were being raped and people robbed of their properties so we organised ourselves to fight this evil.\n It was so ...(indistinct) that people would come to us with complaints that they had been robbed of their TV's or wirelesses.  We had a task force who would go and get hold of what people had been robbed of, free of charge, not charging anybody.  So it went so much that people came to us, and - we had no problem with Orlando East Police, but we got into trouble with Protea, the White police, who eventually heard of our activities.  In that organisation I was the chairman.  Then we were rounded up and locked in.\n By the way by then I had developed sugar diabetes and \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 P HLONGWANE\nI had to be treated.  I had tablets and the way I had before of getting my insulin I had to wait for 15 minutes before I could take any meal, and my meal was specific.  I was told what to eat and what not to eat.  Right, when we got to Protea I told the Captain in charge, I don't know his name, that I was a diabetic case and I asked him, I pleaded with him to please try and get my tablets because we were kept at Protea.  He kept on saying to me well I'll send my men to your place.  Till eventually they decided to send me to Sun City.  They told me there I would get the right food, I would get the right treatment. Now my diabetes was very high, in so much that I was starting to lose my sight.  I remember with the assistance of, the man today, I think he is in the Ministry of Health, Masondo, we had to write and make applications that I should be allowed to go to Baragwanath.  Still it was difficult but eventually we told Mr Smith who was in charge, look he will bear all the consequences if I die.  Then he decided to send me to Baragwanath.  My sugar was up and a lot of complications took place. Well I stayed there for a month with the treatment.  The doctors did their best, till eventually we were released. I came back and I was taken to doctors, as you see in that - my lawyer was not allowed to see me during my time of - that is Mr Whitey, he is in there, to come and pay me a visit at Sun City.\n So after my release we took up the case.  We claimed from the State for the negligence of my sugar because I developed - I could not see any longer.  Everything was just in a cloud and then I was sent to different doctors to examine me and all that.  So the case went on.  Eventually my case had to be dropped because it was a question of \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 P HLONGWANE\nfinance.  I couldn't pay the lawyers.  So that's how it ended up.  I could hardly even buy a pair of spectacles.  I struggled in the way I had after from 1960 I had opened construction, that was building construction of which I was given a place out at Jabavu which I paid for and built and that was a sort-of a show house, an exhibition.  So when I came back from detention the comrades, or whatever they call themselves or I don't know what you call them, anyhow at any rate those are civics, they call themselves civics, they said I could no longer occupy that place, it belonged to them, it is their property. I went to the Council and claimed the place.  They agreed but I could not use the place because it was taken over by the civics.  Now I battled to make ends meet.  \n Thereafter, let me say, there is something I've forgotten, after six months, after the release, we were again arrested.  Then we appealed to Khotso House for  assistance.  They arranged an advocate, they call him Van Vuuren, well he's late, he had an accident in Bloemfontein who defended us.  Now that was the case of detention was all over brought there to us.  We went for trial you know for almost six months and then eventually we were sentenced, three years, five years suspension, fortunately the fines were paid.  The Khotso House assisted us.  \n But I could say in short, due to the negligence I had I could no longer drive and I could not even, you know, carpentry you use sharp instruments, I could not use that because it was dangerous.  So in short that is my story, and in fact I couldn't go and march or sing.  It's a strain.  I've been here since this morning and I am a diabetic case you know, it sort of breaks me down, but perhaps if it was \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 P HLONGWANE\nin the morning I could have given you more details about the whole affair.",
