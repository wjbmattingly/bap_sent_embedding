            "Hello Mama, hello Sepati, I greet you but before I ask you to  tell your story, I just want to give a little bit of the background about Bheki.  On the 17th of November 1989, prompted by the death row confessions of Butana Almond Nofemela, former police captain Johannes Dirk Coetzee made his own series of revelations about his activities as the commander of the SAP's Death Squad.  Following these confessions, CCB members were arrested and detained and F W de Klerk responded to public outcry, and on the 5th of March 1990, the Harms Commission of Inquiry began hearing testimony.  Dirk Coetzee gave key testimony to this Commission.  Fearing for his life following the Harms Commission, Dirk Coetzee fled to Lusaka.  In May 1990 a walkman cassette player with an explosive device contained in the headphones was sent to Coetzee in Zambia.  Coetzee never received the parcel and in February 1990 it was returned to the sender Bheki Mlangeni of the firm Cheadles, Thompson and Hayson.  Mama I'd like you to tell us about Bheki's life please, in your own words.  Please if you feel that you want to stop for a while, let me know, it's your moment.",

            "I am Bheki Mlangeni's mother.  He was born on December the 28th, 1958 at Jabulani.  Bheki Mlangeni was my fourth child. One day he told me that he had applied for a job with Cheadles, Thompson and Hayson.  One day he called me and he said Mom, I'm going to be in work that's going to be a misery in my life, and he said he was in the Harms Commission and there was another side which was called the askari.  That was the time when I started seeing that he was not happy at all.  All these things happened while he worked. He wanted to get married and I said to him, yes if he thought that he was old enough to get married, he can.  I asked him why he doesn't stop working because it is clear that he was unhappy and I reminded him that he knew how poor we were at home and pinned our hopes on him for survival. But he said that there was nothing that he could do because he had been living to help people for his entire life and our people have been tortured. I pressured him to leave his job but he refused as it was the work that he wanted to do, to work with people.\n We led a very low life at home being poor, uneducated and unemployed, earning R3,00 but I prayed to God to help me with my children's education as this would help me to live luxuriously. Bheki promised me that he would receive education and take us out of this poverty. His older brother didn't study because, seeing we couldn't earn more than R5,00 he asked my permission for him to stop studying to go and earn some income in order to help educate the younger siblings.\n We together agreed with his older brother, Bheki went to study and we helped each other with the finances.  Bheki was brilliant and conscientious, he would ask things that we could never answer and he assured me that we would one day rise out of this state of poverty and become very wealthy.  He went on studying and in his letters to me he would sometimes tell me about the people out there who were really hurt, people that he wanted to help. When I asked how he proposed to help them he responded that he wanted to be a lawyer for human rights. Well he managed to become a lawyer.\n While he was in Form 1 he went to Mondhlo where he fell in love with a girl called Norazi and she gave birth.  That I accepted, as according to our tradition, if a son has a child with another person's he has to go and pay. I refused to let him leave school and vowed to try by all means and did my best not to take him out of school.  While things were on that note, in 1978 Bheki met another girl at Khatlehong called Diogo. I asked where he was heading to and he replied that he didn't know.  I was really amazed. \n He left to go and study in Durban where another child called Xolani was born.  Now he had three children.  \n After this I told him that I was tired of him and I insisted that he got married.  In 1986 he met Sepati and in that year they had their first children, his fourth by now. He was very caring for his children not even minding to wash his daughter's underwear.\n   He told me that he was now working with the askaris and that one day he met Dirk Coetzee and went to get some statement......(end of Side A of tape 16)\n(continued on side B but gap in the recording) ....got hold of him and he clearly indicated to me how the procedures went.  During those days he applied for study leave in order to carry on with his studies in this field of law.  \n A telephone call arrived on a Wednesday while he was studying and he was told that the caller had asked where he was and that he had to come but he had refused as he was busy studying and didn't have time. The caller started shouting to the people at home telling them to chase Bheki to hurry up and he told us to tell the caller that he was not there.  I asked him why he was not receiving these extraordinary calls.  This particular call was about a parcel that he had to go and fetch from his place of employment.\n There was another call from his office where Harris said he must come and help and help set the dates for all the child cases on Monday and that's when he left to go to the office but on Thursday before he did this, he asked me to cook supper so that we could eat together around the table as a family.  After that he took the cake which had not yet been cut and I shouted why he cut this cake before going to his wife's family who were supposed to share this cake with us. He insisted that he was cutting it and I wondered what was so important about cutting the cake then.  His face looked very worried, he wasn't the same Bheki that I knew.\n On Friday when I was at work he got a telephone call from his office and he went there very smartly dressed on that day.  He stood before his other siblings...(witness very upset)",

He left for work and I heard that after he had done what he had been called for, he took the parcel and put it in the back and phoned his wife to come and they would go and watch a movie.  After the movie, when they returned home, they went to their room.\n I was very sick at that time and did not even know what I was suffering from.  I saw  my daughter-in-law rushing in and just said, Bheki. I asked her what was wrong with him but she just said, Mama, Bheki at the garage! I was surprised wondering what this garage story was about, and couldn't hear anything, feeling very ill.  When I came out they held me and asked me please not to go into there.   I just skipped through their legs and went in.  I found Bheki in pieces, bits of him on the curtains, pieces of him and his brains all over. That was the end of Bheki.\n But another thing there at home, we are all sick, angry and unhappy people.  Nobody is working, we're suffering.",

            "I met Bheki in 1984.  There was something at the amphitheatre, Bishop Tutu was receiving his Nobel Peace Prize.  Because he was very active in these things we went together with him and we decided to go to the amphitheatre, that's where I first met him.  After having a child with him we fell in love and it led to our marriage. We were just boyfriend and girlfriend, there was an age difference between the two of us.  He was a bit older than me and he had knowledge and was involved in school activities and in an organisation that was taking place in the township. I received a lot of information and knowledge from him because he was quite clear. During that time I can say I was ignorant.  I knew exactly what was happening, I knew the organisation Sofasonke but I wasn't clear about anything.  He was explaining to us in details the issue of Sin...(indistinct), the boycotters and he indicated to me how they got involved in politics.  That's where I realised that he knew exactly what he was doing and he told me that before one became a comrade one started first by boycotting.\nPeople see things, they get hurt and they get evicted from their houses and they see dirty children in the streets, that's where the practice of boycotting started.\n Well we went on in our relationship.  He was now studying at Wits.  We were in love and he was detained in 1985.  I was pregnant at that time.  As I've already said, I didn't understand quite well what was happening.  He arrived on a Sunday evening and he said to me that the police were after him and that it might happen that we would be arrested and that he would see me on Monday if we were lucky but in the event of being arrested he would leave everything with his mother.  He told me that he would bring money since I was pregnant at that time.\n I received a message from my mom that Bheki had been detained.  My parents were already Christians and did not believe anything about politics.  They wanted me to leave Bheki, and did not quite grasp what was happening.  In this detention we had problems because I couldn't see him as we were not yet married at that time and I couldn't be regarded as his fiancee.  He eventually made applications and arranged it so that I managed to see him at Sun City.  I gave birth while he was still in jail.  \n He managed through the DPSC to organise that my child should get a grant.  My mother used to fetch the moneys from the grant and after a year he was released and I had a hope that we were going to lead a normal life. In June there was a state of emergency and they had to run away.  I was going out with a person who was not settled and I couldn't maintain myself.  He said to me that he was going to skip the country but he would try to arrange everything and I must say that he was a provider in everything.  He knew that I was his girlfriend and he always gave me something to help and maintain the child.\n After his release I went to study at Wits University where on my arrival I did not have examination pads or books, but he used to buy me books from the money that he received as a bursary. He used to show me that it was more than love, he was like a brother and a friend to me.  He used to explain to me how university life was and he said to me that I shouldn't just rush into it, the most important thing was to study and look back to where I came from.  I was from a very poor family just as much as he was, I got married to a poor man in 1990 on the 9th and at our wedding he paid labola in February and March and when he finished paying it, he was staying with his mother and I was also staying at my parents' home, until we got married. Even when we got married things were a bit confused.  He said that it was such a long time since he had paid labola, but I didn't want to stay with him until I got married so we just made an informal thing and got married, and then there was a wedding celebration.\n After marriage I stayed with Bheki for two months feeling very happy for having got married and was looking forward to being a married woman like other married women after having suffered for a long time and the person that I had loved for all these years was not settled, because after the organisations were unbanned, I thought everything will now be over.\n This thing continued, I thought the political struggle would be over but he continued.  There was no civic in Jabulani and he started the civic there.  He started the ANC there where there was nothing before that and he became the organisation's chairperson.  With regard to school issues there was a branch called the SOWETO Coordinating Committee, and Bheki was one of the founders.  In everything he did he did not do for personal gain but for the benefit of the community.",

He wanted to see the argument and the whole plot in court and to see if that character would be arrested.\n From there we went to a tea room where we sat down and he took out this parcel which had almost been unwrapped and there was a small box with cassettes, on one of which was written, Evidence, Hit Squad.

May God bless you.  May God strengthen you!  Siabonga.",
