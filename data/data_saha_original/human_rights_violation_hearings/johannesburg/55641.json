This will enable them to be much more part of the proceedings because I am afraid that our backs are to many of you.  So if all the witnesses could simply move right across.  There are plenty of seats in the first three or four rows so perhaps witnesses and their families should avoid sitting immediately behind these chairs otherwise they won't be able to see what is happening.  So keep that free and just spread out.  There's also space on that side if you don't feel comfortable where you are.  Thank you very much, I am sorry to disturb you but I think that that's a much better idea.  We are also grateful that the suggestion came from the Archbishop and myself.  (General laughter).\n If we are settled then I would like to call the next witness Mrs Rokaya Salojee, if you would please come to the witness stand.

            "In 1960 the first state of emergency saw the introduction of detention without trial.  In 1963 detention without trial was made a permanent feature of our law by the passing of the General Laws Amendment Act no.37.  This Act was passed after the killing of two people of the White race and the near fatal attack on three others by the PAC at the end of 1962.  Under the 90 days detention legislation a detainee could be held in custody for interrogation until he had, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Police replied satisfactorily to all questions.  If the Commissioner felt that questions had not been satisfactorily answered the detention of the detainee could be extended.  The detainee was only permitted visits each week by a magistrate.  Legal\nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 R SALOJEE\nadvisors were not permitted access to detainees.  The detainee was also not permitted visits by anybody else. Suliman Salojee, known as Bubla, was the fourth person to die in detention.\n By 1990 78,000 people had been detained of which 73 died.  In 33 instances inquest courts had certified the cause of death as suicide.  Of these five had allegedly been found to have jumped off buildings.\n Suliman Salojee a 32 year old attorney's clerk was detained on July 6 1964.  On September the 9th he allegedly fell to his death, 60 feet from the seventh floor office at the Grey's(?).  Suliman was married to Rokaya who will now tell you his and her story.  Rokaya tell your story slowly.",

            "I was married for two years and six days to be exact when he was detained.  I don't know whether they took him from the house or from work because I was at work.  In any case when I heard that he was detained I went to Grey's(?) building and they wouldn't tell me where my husband was.  Only after a couple of days when I went back they told me that he is in Rosebank Police Station.  When I asked for a visit I never got a visit.  In fact in all the time he was there I got two visits.  One was five minutes and the other one was ten minutes, or maybe a little more.\n Why I asked for the first visit because I believed that he was sick.  I also found it out accidentally because when I used to take food to Rosebank Police Station and I saw the policeman there he had a bottle on the shelf and I asked him, but he wouldn't tell me anything, so I decided to go back.  Those days we had a trick to say if you want to know whether your husband is interrogated or not, or whether he is at his cell or not you should ask for the dishes and for \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 R SALOJEE\nhis clothes. \n So after about a week again I asked the warder there please man I don't know what to do because I've got no more dishes and I've got no more clothing because  - out of winter.  I think he slipped up and he said well your husband hasn't been here for over a week.  After he said it he realised it and he even asked me please don't mention that because we are not in charge of the detainees, we are only to take the food in and the clothing in.  So I asked him can you give me the clothing, so he said I can't give it to you because it's not clean.  What I meant by that I knew exactly.\n In any case I went back and I asked for a visit which they granted me.  And apparently those days you couldn't get into the bus and I was a bit late and I phoned the security police to say that I am late I've got to take the bus to Rosebank and we are only allowed seven non-whites.  In any case I got there and it was rather late already.  When they opened the cell door I saw my husband had a patch on his head.  When I asked him - I didn't even greet, I just asked what happened to you and this one policeman said that he bumped his head in the cell.  So I said that's funny he must have been drunk because there is nothing else that's in the cell that you can bump your head on.  They closed the door on me and told me to go away, which I did.  I had no alternative.\n I didn't even speak to my husband.  All he said to me in Gujerati, is that I should keep quiet.  He still wanted to speak and they closed the door because we were not allowed to speak any other language, but if you could speak Afrikaans you were better off than English speaking.  \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 R SALOJEE\n But in the end I went back again and I asked to see my husband again.  And this time I had to lie, it wasn't a lie, it was the truth but I was worried to say that I am in financial difficulties and I need to see my husband to ask where should I borrow money.  That was in Grey's building, they didn't immediately, after a week or so they allowed me. When I went to Grey's building there were eight men standing and he was standing in the centre of the room.  When I got there they told me you've got five minutes to tell your husband what you want.  They didn't offer me a seat, they didn't offer him a seat.  I had to stand about three feet from him before I could speak.  I couldn't ask anything, that's the only thing I could ask.  Then he said ja I must go to the family and ask for money.  And they told me that is all, I have to leave.\n Then when I went back again they told me that I asked the same thing again that if I could see my husband, because I realised he was sick, they must have polished him up that day when they brought him there because I wasn't allowed to go near him.  But in any case when I asked for another visit Colonel Clint, he's a late now, and he actually swore at me.  I wouldn't use the language of course that we come there and make a nuisance out of ourselves.  Our husbands that are detained are better looked after than them.  He had (...indistinct) and he showed me where it pained.  I said I am not interested in your health, I am interested in my husband's health.  And he refused to give me a visit.\n In any case I continued and then on the 9th I was getting ready to take food to the prison and I think it was just half an hour before I left, Swanepoel and I don't know the other members because they said they were Railway \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 R SALOJEE\nPolicemen, and they said to me that you needn't go to the police station because your husband is in the hospital.  So I asked them which hospital.  They told me in Johannesburg Hospital.  In any case I had my (...indistinct) and a friend of mine they phoned every hospital and they couldn't find any trace of him.  So they went back to Coronation and said no he must be here, they said even if the king comes in we have to register the patient.  Then came the Press people.  In the meantime everybody knew what happened to my husband but I didn't because maybe I didn't want to believe it.\n There was a Press fellow by the name of Terry.  That was the last time I ever saw Terry.  I was sitting in the lounge and he came in and he said to me Mrs Salojee I'd like a statement from you.  So I said Terry how can I make a statement when I don't even know where my husband is.  And I think he didn't think he said your husband is in the mortuary.  He never went to the hospital.",

            "The only time that they notified me was to tell me that my husband is in the hospital, that's all.  But in the meantime he never ever reached any hospitals.  How many days afterwards was - I mean he ....(tape ends).. a Press fellow told me he's never reached hospital he went straight to the mortuary. That must have been between nine and 10 I am not sure.\n But in any case they came that night, the Special Branch and they told me that I should sign this document and if I don't sign the document they will not give the body.  So I said I am not going to sign it.  If you people want to keep the body you can keep it.  In any case they eventually \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 R SALOJEE\nwent away.  They came the next day and they did send the body.  I don't know who and all went and  - you know when it's a Moslem the men take over and those days there weren't very many men around, it was political because people had left the country and things like that.  But in any case I remembered very clearly the day my husband died, the day I buried him that was - I was in grief but this hurt a little more.  I knew when I married him he was a political man. \n There was a man by the name of Salaam Abram Myers.  That night, the same night he (...indistinct) Verwoerd and he asked if you could (...indistinct) Verwoerd before they take the body or after.  And whoever answered him said you can take the body with you and present it to Verwoerd.\n In any case you don't feel lonely, you don't feel lost but after everybody leaves then you feel the pressure.  Then the Special Branch came back to me and they said to me your husband has died but you are going to die too because you are going to commit suicide, and I knew exactly what they meant by that, because they told me they are going to take me to the Zoo Lake.  I said to them you can't do any worse what you did to me, so it doesn't matter what you do, but I said in the meantime you get the hell out of my house.  I don't know was the pressure too much or maybe they were shocked, it was not that I was a very brave woman, I was a very scared woman, and I think that I was so scared that it didn't matter what I said.  Only afterwards I realised.   Then after that many people asked me why don't I go away.  I had a nervous breakdown and then I went and applied for a passport and the fellow that normally gives you a passport was Van Tonder.  You have to see him to ask, he would sign your document, and I went about four times.  The \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 R SALOJEE\nfifth time I went I couldn't take it anymore, and he said to me ah you are here again.  He says we could make life easy for you but you are a very difficult woman, so I will not give you a passport.  Actually I'll use the exact words what I said, I am sorry for being rude, I said you can give it if you want to give it, if you don't want to give it you can shove it.  He pulled me over the table and I was so scared I didn't believe I could say a thing like that to this man you know sitting behind the desk.  And he called immediately, normally when you go in you've got two guards at the bottom, they escort you to the lift, when you get into the lift you have got two others, they take you up to this floor and when you get up there you have got two others and they take you in and they stand outside, and these two armed cops came and they came and pulled me out and they told me to go.  I went.\n For many years they didn't just make my life miserable but they did my family too and especially my mother.  They used to go there, search the place and leave it as it is and things like that.  So that's why I never went back to my family because I tell - I lost my husband, if anybody has to suffer for him then it should be me, why bring everybody else in this trauma that I am going through.\n My family was very supportive and a few friends I had they would do anything for me.  But in any case it became so unbearable that I left my home and I went to board with other people.  At that time it's very few people that would give you a place to stay.  Immediately when you tell them that I am Salojee then they want to know which Salojee, and if you tell them that you were Bubla Salojee's wife they would say I am sorry but I cannot give you a place to \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n8 R SALOJEE\nstay.",

Eventually when they harassed that man then I moved.  I normally moved from one place to another as soon as people where I stayed got harassed I left and went somewhere else.  At my workplace also when I went back after my husband's death my boss that was in charge of me he didn't tell me to go but he did make my life very miserable and eventually I couldn't take it anymore and I walked out.

I did whatever I could.\n I remember Swanepoel coming again one day and he said to me that if you want to we can be very nice to you, we will offer you a house, we will offer you a car plus we will give you an allowance for the month if you could inform about the whereabouts of the communists.

I am sorry to say that, but that's how - if I see a White policeman I hate him.  I've got many White friends but it's unfortunate that at that time you had informers, if I think back then I think I shouldn't hate the White man only, I should hate my own people that worked with the system because if my own people were not there I think so many people would have been arrested and harassed like Salaam Mayatz and them.  If they didn't inform about us and make our lives unpleasant, like the late Mrs Mary Moodley, she was one of my great friends, and one day the same fellows, Salaam Mayatz stayed across and he knew, because he was not working he was sitting there the whole day and watching who is coming at that house.  \n One day I went there because she was banned and she said to me go and jump in the coal box, they had a big box that they put coal in, she said because I think this fellow is going downstairs because her husband used to stand on the corner and watch for us, her being banned she couldn't have more than two visitors, and in that house there were always people.  She said to me go and jump in the coal box.

And I remember as a school student coming from (...indistinct) to your house and singing outside your house and you coming out just after the death of Bubla.  I just want to raise two issues.  One is you say Bubla was a political person, I wonder if you can actually just enlighten us a little more about that because that period as Yasmin has already pointed out was a very difficult historical period in our lives.   Political parties had been banned, treason trials were taking place and here was a young man from a relatively comfortable family who was willing to make this sacrifice.\n If I can also add my second question, you mentioned several times in your statement the name Swanepoel, was this gentleman implicated directly in the torture of Bubla, it's not clear from your statement?  Secondly, was there any sympathy ever shown by the same gentlemen when they came to your house after the death of Bubla?",

I don't know but I don't think so.  But Swanepoel, like I say, if they go to Greys Building you are not there so you cannot say who tortured him.  I can only tell of the event when they told me, Swanepoel told me your husband is dead now you are going to commit suicide at the Zoo Lake.  So I cannot tell you exactly but I am sure at that time there are people that were alive and came out to tell the story, but I cannot JOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n16 R SALOJEE\ntell the story because I wasn't detained to come out and say well Swanepoel has tortured me, because they wouldn't tell you who tortured your husband.  They would normally change.  You would have sometimes five people standing there in the room and questioning you because I used to go there, practically every month I had to go and report there they would question you and the next time when you go there again, you go to the bench you would find somebody else that you have got to register and when you go up to the security then there was maybe one person that was present that you know the last time, but then there were other people that you didn't know because they never introduced themselves.  You had to find out for yourself who the people are.  So there were so many changes that you eventually don't know how many names there are.  Are there five, are there ten or are there a hundred, you were not sure, and that's - I was not sure but I knew that Swanepoel was the one that told me that he is dead, you are the next to commit suicide.  \n Like I said only those who were detained and came out can say who and who tortured them, but I cannot say.  That is what I would like to know. That's why I have asked the Commission to enquire and find out.  I can only give you one name and that's Swanepoel.  From there I am sure you could get the other names.  There are many people that were tortured and detained so they can give you other names.
