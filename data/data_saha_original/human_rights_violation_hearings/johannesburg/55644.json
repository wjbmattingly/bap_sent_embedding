It's been a very, very long day and you have had to wait to the very end, and it's bad enough having the anguish and the pain that you are carrying to have to sit and wait for such a long time.  Please forgive us.  It's beyond our control.\n Mr Smit we do welcome you and we do express our very deep appreciation to you for your readiness and willingness to come to this Commission.  We always obviously give people the opportunity to speak in whichever language they would like and if you would like to give your testimony in Afrikaans obviously that's up to you.  If you would like to use the earphones that's also up to you, but I shouldn't think that would be necessary. \n I would like to ask you to please take the oath.",

At the time he had gone to Natal with his grandparents for a holiday and whilst they were shopping, two days before Christmas at the Sanlam Shopping Centre in Amanzimtoti this bomb blast occurred.  Can you tell us how did you get the news and what happened?",

I thought that it might be a car accident because he didn't explain what type of accident it was.  My wife was doing shopping and I had to find her.  I phoned a couple of shops and eventually one of the shops found her and told her that she had to return immediately.  In the meantime my uncle phoned me again and said it was quite serious, we've got to come down.\n By this time it was already late in the afternoon because I couldn't find my wife.   I thought he thought that I wasn't interested in coming down to Durban.  But when Annamarie arrived we immediately went down to Durban.  But by then we still didn't know there was a bomb blast.  We only found out that it was a bomb blast when we arrived in Durban in the hospital.  I can't remember the name of the hospital. They told us that my son's not there but they know of a little boy who was in the mortuary.  By that time, it was very late, the mortuary was already closed and I went to my uncle's house.  It might be that I only found out then \nJOHANNESBURG HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 J SMIT\nthat it was a bomb blast.  I can't really remember.\n We went to see him the following morning but I didn't want to believe that it was my son that was lying there.  I asked them to take him out of the glass case so that I could see his chin.  Under his chin he had a small little cut which he got when I accidentally dropped him when he was a child.  I still really didn't want to believe it and my wife and my father had to convince me it was my child.\n Then after that we came up to Pretoria.  We buried him in Pretoria.  I told newspapers that I thought my son was a hero because he died for freedom for people that - I would prefer to speak Afrikaans.  He died in the cause of the oppressed people.  A lot of people criticised me for this.  They thought that I was a traitor and they condemned me, but I still feel that way today.  I feel that few White people in this country would ever have  ...(tape ends) they really struggle, they'd buy small amounts of paraffin and really didn't have much money.
