Before I could even answer the doors were kicked and I realised it was the police.\n They came in and I was preparing myself to get up.  They asked me who I was. I said to them I was Mareko.  \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 L M MOTHIBI\nThat was a funny name that people used to call me by. They used to say I was not Marex, I am Mareko.\n They ordered me to dress and when I went outside they kicked me.  They assaulted me, they even used the butts of the guns to hit me.  I didn't understand what was happening, because I was not even told the reason for the assault and they asked me whether I knew Beebop.   I said to them, no I do not know who Beebop was, but they continually assaulted me, they kicked me. I fell on the ground and they used their butts to hit me.\n They took me into their Landrover and they took turns in the township. They went straight to Beebop's house.  They knocked at the door.  Beebop was not there.  \n We drove off and came to Vryburg Police Station and they locked me up.  \n The next day, it was a Monday, on the 17th they fetched me from the cell, it was about 9 o'clock,  They interrogated me.  They asked me whether I know who Zero was and I said to them, yes I know him.  And they say if you knew him then you know what happened. I told them no, I don't know what happened.\n Then they said to me, you must know.  And then they started assaulting me again.  They assaulted me until my head got swollen.",

They forced me to agree that I was present when the girl was burnt.  I refused to agree MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n3 L M MOTHIBI\nto what they were saying.  And they continually assaulted me, using their gun butts.\n We spent that day, and they continually assaulted me.\n At about one o'clock they locked me up again.\n The next day, it was the second day, they fetched me again and they asked me the same story.  They said I should agree that I was present when the girl was burnt to death.  And I told them, gentlemen I was not present when the girl was burnt.  I know nothing.\n And I know the police would hit at that.  It was Brand, Strydom, Bangula and the other one was Spanepoetie.  It was three white policeman and a black man.\n The third day the same thing happened. Thee assault me and the false confessions they wanted me to make.   They left me and they came with their statement. There was a policeman that I referred to as Bangula, he was heavily built.  He came with a written statement and he ordered me to sign but I refused.\n On refusing to sign that, they assaulted me again.  \n I ended up signing the statement and  I agreed that I was there when the girl was burnt.  And in actual fact I was not there.  They were threatening me that if I did not agree to what they were saying, that I was present when the girl was burnt, they would fasten me at the back of the Landrover and pulled (sleep) me until I die.\n They say I should talk about Zero and Shine and Fakajek.  I should also state that they were involved in the burning of this girl.   They said I should speak that those three men burnt this girl to death.  And I didn't know anything about that.  They wanted me to be their witness, they wanted me to agree that yes, it was \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n4 L M MOTHIBI\nZero and Shiny and them who burnt this girl.  They wanted me to be their witness in that case.\n I stayed in the cells.  We were doing practically nothing, we only sat in the cells.  Even if we went to court there would be nothing taking place.   Every time we would be taken back and told that there was no bail at all because we would run away - until in 1986 on the 9th of May, if I remember well.\n I will end there.",
