His mother used to tell me that they were being terrorised, the children could not sleep.  They were roaming around the township.  Then there came a time when the police came to arrest this boy and they sent him to jail.\n Whilst he was in jail, because they were terrorising me regarding him and they used to search my house for him and never explained to me what they were looking for.  I only heard later that they were looking for this boy.  \n Then one day, on a Sunday, whilst I was already asleep, together with the other children, we heard a knock at the\nat the door and I then asked who was at the door, they\nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n2 E S LOKWALENG\nanswered by saying, it was the police.  And then we went to open the door. \n When they entered the house it were white policemen,  they asked who Eva was.  I said it was me and they said, wake up, put on your clothes and accompany us.  I asked them, where were you taking me.  They said, don't ask any question.  Just wake up and dress and come together with us.\n I told them that tomorrow I have to go to school, and they said to me no, come with us.  You'll be given a chance to go to school.\n When I left the house  I realised that they had many vans outside and there was also a big Hippo in which I found some of us and I also alighted that Hippo.  And then we made jokes, asking one another, where are we being taken to?   And then they took us to the cells.  I found other people like Mrs Gashe and the other children who are present here and we stayed there at the cells.\n We stayed there for about a month.  When the schools were to open on the following the day, on the 14th they took us and transferred us to Kimberley.  \n We stayed in Kimberley in July, in the middle of July, then I got the message that this boy was killed and he died on the spot.  \n They kept me in the cells from the 11th of June until September.   \n I am finished, sir.",
