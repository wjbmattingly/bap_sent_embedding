            "Yes, I can explain regarding that.  It was on the 18th of June 1990, when I got home that day.  My mom told me that the police were here at night, looking for you.  MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n9 M MOKOTEDI\nAnd I left immediately for the police station to hear what they wanted from me.\n When I got to the police station they told me that Captain Brand was the one looking for me.  And they took me in a car to the office of the CID, where I found Gabriel and they also took me into the cell.  They closed and locked me up.  \n I just heard some noise and I could tell that something was happening.  Someone's been tortured.\n And they appear, silently, with Gabriel, the police and they ask Gabriel, do you know this one, meaning me.  Gabriel said, yes:   Was he present when they burnt that person from Battalion 32?   And he said, yes, he was present.\n And they asked what I heard what he said.  And I said, yes, I heard.    I said to them, I can't tell you anything.  You should have asked me, because I could have explained to you.\n And they asked me to explain.  I said to them I don't know anything about burning this person.  I wasn't present and I can tell you where I was on that day.  If you don't believe me, you could go and ask someone else like you did ask Gabriel.\n And he threatened me.  And I said, you can't threaten me in that way.  I was threatened in the past time and you can't do that to me again.  And they then locked me up again.\n At night, at about four, they took me and locked me in the cell.  At night they also came to fetch Gabriel and they left with Gabriel.  When Gabriel came back he had marks all over his body.  The marks of beatings.  You could tell the wounds were swollen.\nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n10 M MOKOTEDI\n When he was crying, I tried to console him, telling him that you have to be stronger than this.  Don't worry, just keep on telling them what you were telling them.  And I told him that I am from the magistrate to give a statement and I told everything in the statement. \nIf you agreed with them, you would create problems for me.  You could have told them that I was ... that you were not present.  You will see them as time goes on. \n They then came back again.   I stayed for about 48 hours in the cells and in those 48 hours they took him away for about three times and when he returned in the night you could see he was crying, he was swollen, he was bleeding from his nose and you could see that someone was washing him with cold water in the evening while it was cold.  Then they returned him to the cell to lock him up.\n They tried to find out where I  was and they released me the next morning and they said to me that when this Battalion 32 soldier returns from the hospital at Pretoria, they will come to fetch me for an identification parade.  \n We went to such a parade and they fetched me in the morning.  When we got to the identification parade, because I know what the behaviour of the South African policemen were, I knew what to tell them.  \n They like identifying people through their fingerprints.  The second thing is they like to influence the other policemen to look for Zero.  If he does anything, even if it could be a simple thing, you should call him in, assault him and the following day you should give him a fine that he was drunk.\n Then I realised that such things could get me into trouble. When we went to such a parade, they made us stand MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n11 Z MONGALE\ntogether with other prisoners so that we could put our hands behind our backs.  And they knew that the other guy would \nidentify my fingers.  And we agreed to what they said.  \n They asked us whether we would like our lawyer to be \npresent.  I said, yes.  And he said, no it was not necessary for your lawyer to be present, because they wanted to finish this case quickly.  I said ok you can go on with your work.\nOn the third time when they came around ... There were the three of us who were given bail.  So they left us there - I said it is ok we will stand here.  When one guy was left behind and the other guy went away, I said to my friend Toy, get out of there because you can't trust these people.\n I took off the T-shirt I was wearing, I took a prisoner's T-shirt and wore it and went away and Toy was left standing there.   \n When this person came around he took Toy from where he was standing, because he was the second person from where the line was starting and I was about the ninth person in the line.  And then I went to the fourth place and the took Toy away and Toy made a statement.   While he had to come to me he didn't come to me, he went to the person who was standing in the place I was in before.  And then he said to me you'll make a plan for me, to arrest me and I will end up in jail or they would end up having killed me.",

            "Yes, I have no problem talking about that.    What I remember about 1985 is that Frida Mabalane who was a member of the Huhudi Youth Organization - and if I remember well - Frida Mabalane had a case of public violence against her.   We used to work together with her in the Huhudi Youth Organization.   She was also my girlfriend.\n What amazed me about Frida is that on the 25th of November while we were together in a meeting, because we as the youth was being attacked by Inkatha, and we realised that if we could leave the situation as it is then maybe disperse, nothing would happen to us.  So we had to unite and tried to protect ourselves against the Inkatha people.\n On the 24th, it was on a Sunday, someone has attacked Bra Hoffie's house, that is Hoffman Galeng and his family, were being stoned and were being hit with knopkieries and pangas.  Because these people having killed all our leaders we will have to take initiative to go and gut Mr Hoffman Galeng's house and we went away and when we were at the corner of Mahuro and Magapero there came a van of the Inkatha leader by the name of Mathong.   The van was indicating to the right side and when he saw the group, he didn't turn to right they went straight to the group  and they pulled the brakes up there and we watched them, we wanted to see what they wanted to do.  \n Two of them ran back to the shop.  From the shop they were carrying pangas and guns.   The other two were in the van, that was the driver and the other guy.  The other three were in the back of the van.   They started shooting around and no one could stay at that place.  We all ran away.\n We I was trying to jump a fence I found one of these MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n15 Z MONGALE\nguys running behind one of the leaders of the Huhudi.  It was Keeper.  And then I ran after this guy who was Jason Keeper until the Sihumi and Makasani Streets corner.  When we got to the corner he turned to overtake me, that was the person by the name of Joba.  When we got into Barclay Street there was another car which nearly hit Joba.  It was about five  o'clock and people were knocking off from work and all those people dispersed and ran away.  And we stayed at the corner of the street.  I wanted to see what was the aim of those people.\n Just there they stopped and they were shooting at the direction of the people and the people ran away.  And then they reversed the car.  I ran into the corner house.  When I entered it one of my friends, Sylvester Gasabui came running and Frida was standing on the other side, shouting, saying that they should leave him alone, they should leave her alone.  And then I left Frida there.  \n In the evening we went to guard Mr Hoffman Galeng's \nhouse.  It was already on Monday.  Sylvester had already been kicked by these people.\n On the following morning when we were still sitting Frida came along and she wrote something, where she was.   I asked to come to me and she tried to run away and I went to her and asked her to see what she had written and she refused.  And then I asked her again.  And then she refused again.\n I took out a knife and I stabbed her and she ran away.  And I took what she had written.  I read it and I gave the people what I read.  It was our names on that list and I said to those people, do you see how we get killed?\n And on the night of that day I last saw Frida.  One MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n16 Z MONGALE\nthing I heard about her is that she was burnt, because when I went to sleep no one was roaming the streets in the night because the situation was bad.  There were only police and the Inkatha people running around at night.   And I think it is only the police and the Inkatha people who could know how Frida died.\nBecause they were supposed to know whether Frida was a member of the Huhudi Youth Organization.
