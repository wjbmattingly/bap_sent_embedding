<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Mochawe you gave us a very focused, a very clear statement and I would like you in your own words,to share that again orally with us and with those present here.  You have the floor.  Please tell us your story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOCHAWE:</span> It was on the 19th October 1990.  That day I woke up just fine.  I left my place for work.   On my way I saw people coming from the other direction - the opposite direction I was heading for.  I was surprised, the group of people coming from the opposite, I was wondering what was happening.  I thought I should just ask one of those people what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> The person told me that the policemen were beating people up on the other side.  As he was relating the story,  there the teargas was falling just in front of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>I just saw it was wise for me to save myself and go back </p>

<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>2 S MOCHAWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>home in stead of going to work.   I did exactly that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a> As I entered home I asked, where are the children? She told me that the children went to school.  I asked her what time did they go to school?   She told me, just now, they just left.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a> I left, to go out.  They were still not so far away.  I told them, don't go to school.  There is just confusion outside.  They went back home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> As I was also going out of the home to see if everything was safe, then a Hippo came by.  Because I was also scared, I thought probably something could happen to me as well, and I thought of just going back home, running to the door, opening the door, it was just when I felt the shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> I just sat down and some boys ran by to just pull me inside the home.   At night, I don't even know where they got transport to take me to hospital, but I got to the hospital, and at hospital I just had some difficulties there.   I was lying there and there was not so much help that we got from the hospital.  And the way I was, I was just in pain, sleeping in there.  There was also the AWB there who didn't allow anyone to enter the building we were in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> I also consulted the doctor on that very night of the same day.   The doctor didn't give me any treatment.  He only ordered me to be smeared with an ointment on the back and on the head.   I only stayed in the hospital, receiving this treatment with the ointment.  Even when I wanted to go to the toilet the AWB told me, just mess around yourself where you are staying.  Because this is where you are coming to die.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> Luckily it was on a Tuesday morning, the doctor discharged me from the hospital.  I couldn't walk and I was held by the other people, who took me home. When I arrived at home I found that people were already making funeral arrangements for me, they thought I was dead.    </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a> By the time I was in the hospital there were white policemen who came to me, who took a statement from me.  What surprised me even up until today is that I have never been to the court with this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a> Some of the people who got shot on that very same day, some of whom I saw at the hospital, were sentenced to jail.  Others were sentenced for about four years and others for about five years.   The others are still here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a> I am still surprised up until today why haven't been afforded the opportunity to appear in court after so many years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a> I am no more able to carry on.  I'm not able to carry on any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you have anything more to say, then you can do it at your convenience?   Mr Mochawe, can I just ask, does that conclude your story or do you have something more to tell us and if so, you can do that a little later if you want to take a break.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOCHAWE:</span> Sir, I won't be able to carry on.  I still have this pellet in my body now.  I 'm not feeling well here.  I'm not able to carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you let this matter stand down and that you leave the stand for the moment and if you feel better later, we will recall you and if you would like to continue then we will do so.</p>
