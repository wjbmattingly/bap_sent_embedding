            "Whilst resident in Johannesburg, I happened to be involved in affairs that resulted in the uprising of 1976.  We were opposed to Afrikaans as medium of instruction.  I was very prominent.  As you know, people started running all over the country.  I was a member of the school board, Midlands School Board, under the Chairmanship of the late Mr A Lethlape.\n Apparently, Lethlape as a Mangope man, gave our names to Mangope.  That we have people here in Johannesburg who would or who could help in the development of Bophuthatswana.   Not me alone, but people like Boss Solirathebe,  Mr Mokale, quite a number of them who ultimately became cabinet ministers here.  I could not feature in the Mangope Government although on various occasions I was offered a cabinet post, if only I was prepared to serve under Mangope, but I flatly refused.   I preferred to be a South African at all times.  That resulted in my being removed because now the Superintendent of Midlands where I was residing, called to his office and told me I was wanted by my people, my government.  I had to leave and vacate the house.\n I suggested to the Superintendent, let my leave my family here and go back to Mafikeng and hear why those people want me there.  Fortunately, I still own that house up to this day because my children are still there.\nHe was humanly enough to allow that to happen, but I had \nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n11 S THWANE\nto come to Mafikeng.  And I was never allowed to go back, because immediately on arrival here, they took my pass.  I was a holder of a pass book.  It was taken by the Mangope regime.",

We never thought the country would be split into pieces and whilst I was working I built a house here for my retirement.  And it was occupied by my relatives all along.  So I had no problem with accommodation, but having refused offers by Mangope I knew I would never be employed, unless by the private sector and I was not just prepared.\n I felt, accepting a job would be accepting not to be a South African, but to be a member of a bantustan regime.   So I preferred to live from hand to mouth, relying mostly on my wife who was and is still employed.  Apparently was employed by Susanna's sister.  She was transferred over here.

I was working out at Vereniging, I was working for the Railway Services, I was a booking clerk, selling tickets at the station.  I was then a good-paying job.  I was quite comfortable.  It made me bitter to find myself loosing that job, because I was bend on working until pensioned.  I was in Dlamane but I had\nhad conditioned myself not to interfere with the Government money because we assumed the rally was on by the  Government and that would have resulted in me getting a comfortable MMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n14 S THWANE\npension.\n But on arrival here I ran around, I reorganised myself.  After refusing offers by the Mangope regime, I started by selling coal.  I became a coal merchant, which resulted in me building a shop.  All along I was owning that shop whilst a politician at the same time.  But on my release, because my wife could not man the shop, it was manned by relatives.  It deteriorated.  I am busy trying to rebuild it at the moment to re-establish it again.

At the time you gave your statement to us and in your statement you say when you were questioned by the police in Mafikeng you said you knew nothing about the coup.  I understand why you would say that at the time, but at the time that you gave your statement to us your statement does not actually say very much about the very central role that you yourself played from what you said to us today, in strategizing for the coup and organizing for that coup.

The office is his but he employs people who goes through these files one might have gone through that, gone through my file, seeing all that, then unexpectedly revealed.  And just to find myself again in trouble, so I kept most of the information to\nMMABATHO HEARING TRC/NORTH WEST\n15 S THWANE\nmyself, which I would I only give when appearing before the court with my lawyer.  And I did not, when making the statement here, actually talk as I am now.  I just gave over what I have asked from my lawyer.  \n I asked my lawyer to give me the statement.   I made a photostat copy and I gave it to the people who were taking the statements.  So now it appears as if there is a difference.

Mr Thwane you say in what you have been talking about today in the strategising for the coup you recognised that if it failed, it meant disaster, personally and for your PPP, Progressive People's Party.  You also go on to say you were willing to take life, whether the life of Mangope, President Mangope at the time, or anybody else for that matter who supported him.\n My question, therefore, is in your arrest were you, therefore, prepared for what was going to happen to you in terms of the torture and beatings that you experienced or \nnot?",
