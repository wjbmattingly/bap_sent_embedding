            "Thank you Chairperson.  You have come to tell us about how a group of people called NKATHA assaulted you, shot at you.  We've had similar stories before this morning and in the past and it seems to us that the police worked in collaboration with a number of people to suppress anti apartheid activism not only in Ashton in the Boland, but in many other parts as well.\n We've also heard how sometimes in fact very often people when they wanted to know - to find explanation to the type of things that happened to them and their loved ones, how the Courts were never helpful instead we heard how the Courts tendered to be on the side of those who perpetrated the crimes.\n We've also heard how police worked in communities, within communities to split communities and create opponents within communities using members of the community to hate fellow compatriots, fellow members of the community.  It's very sad that this has taken place in our country and we understand how difficult it is for you and others to live among people who were perpetrators and working with the police.  We ask you to help us to understand what has happened to you through the actions of those people called Incatha.  In the beginning we ask you to tell us that those people known as Incatha, what were they doing",

            "STATEMENT FROM WITNESS",
            "I was sitting at home in my house at no 17 Majola Street her in Zolani when the police and NKATHA came into my house.  In the house were my friends Abe and Msimeleli who is the neighbour.  Also in the house was my wife Agnes and Mgcina, who was a young man then.  It was during December 1985 when we were sitting and enjoying ourselves with some beers on the table.  It was in the evening when two police vans stopped and parked in front of house facing each other.  Two policemen walked in, it was a Coloured and a white guy.\nAlthough I forgot their names the Coloured boy/policeman, I know him and his family from  Bonnievale.  The white policeman, I knew him before he was a policeman, as a speed/traffic cop/officer in Montagu.  Both of them came as policemen from Montagu.  As they were walking inside the house there were people walking behind the two policemen.  \nAt the time there were people in Zolani that were state vigilantes, working hand in hand with the police.  Their role was to beat the people in the community who were against the police or the Government structures at that time.  These people were called or known as NKATHA who were only here to suppress the comrades/oumagabane in Zolani.\nApparently there were the people who were behind the policemen.  The only people I can remember from NKATHA since they came from my community were  Watu Matroos and Kokoloi.  Matroos are brothers from Zolani.  Then there's Phani Klaas and Lusizi Klaas who were relatives.  They were all inside my house during the beating.  I cannot remember the names of the others who were outside.  They were carrying knobkieries with big heads in their hands.\nLusizi told Mgecini to go away because he did not belong in the house.  Mgcini resisted but they forced him out of the house.  When Lusizi came back he came straight to me and grabbed me by the chest and I did the same thing to him.  Others came to help and overpowered me by beating me severely with he knobkieries on the head and on my arms and everywhere so as to knock me down.  The two policemen did nothing to stop this, they only watched and enjoyed themselves.  At the time I was loosing power and I think I was becoming unconscious because I could not remember anything afterwards.  But what I could remember is when they beat me on my back against my waist, that was when I thought I was paralysed.  \nThey actually beat me from inside the house and it moved out of the house on the stoep in front of the doorway.  Seemingly after they thought I was helpless and unconscious they left me there.  They further took my wife and Abe and put them into the police van.  I do not remember when they came back.  When I regained consciousness it was in the middle of the night and it was very quite outside.  There was no-one.  I thought I was paralysed because I could not make a move or stand up.\nFortunately a friend from around Msimelelo and a woman in the neighbourhood came to help me because there was no-one in the house.  Only the children were inside the house but they were already sleeping at the time of the beatings.  So they organised transport for me to go to the hospital in Montagu.  At that time I was bleeding from the head, my joints were loose and my back was painful.  At the hospital they stitched me on the head only and sent me back home.  I was critical in the sense that my bones were paining and giving me problems at that time.  Another problem I had was urinary in that my system was uncomfortable to an extent that my urine just came out at any moment.\nI was helped by the MAG [Montagu, Ashton Gemeenskap] project by a person by the name of Dawie Bosch who was part of this project.  Their task was to help the victims at that time.  Dawie Bosch took me to Dr Beyers in Ashton who had his private surgery there.  Dr Beyers tried to examine me and give me some necessary injections.  He then referred me back to Montagu Hospital for X-rays.  I brought them [X-rays] back to him.  Through the X-rays Dr Beyers discovered that the bone at the back in my waist was damaged by the beatings.\nHowever, I must mention that Dr Beyers was a very hard doctor, he was not co-operating voluntarily.  He had to be forced by Dawie Bosch and another guy whom I think was Mr Marc from MAG, in order to realise that my health situation was in a critical condition.  For instance although he discovered these things he never did anything practical.  He only gave me pain tablets.  Dr Beyers was not helpful and he only did this for a day or two.\nAfter that I had to find doctors on my own.  Further than this Dawie Bosch of MAG took me to the police to report the case because the police did not take statements from victims of NKATHA/police.  So Dawie had to use his powers and influence to report the matter to the police station in Ashton.\nI therefore gave my statement which I had already given to Dawie.  So this written statement was given to Hansen in order to read it, sign it and do something about it.  Hansen was like a head of the police station at Ashton.  The response I got was that my case had been dismissed and it was signed by the Station Commander WH de la Querre dated 1986/07/09.  In fact before I got this letter from Ashton Station Commander, I had already received a letter from Dawie Bosch that my statement was not considered.  After that there was a total silence about my case.  \nAt the time the situation had not changed in Zolani.  People were daily beaten by NKATHA and policemen from Ashton and Montagu.  In 1995 I gave another statement to the  Trauma Centre in Zolani.",

It's a story that we have - or a circumstance I should say that we've heard often today, which prevailed in Zolani.  We've heard a lot of witnesses speaking today about the conflict which existed there between the vigilante's, Amasolomzi and a section of the community.\n We are surprised that an innocent activity like watching TV can spark off an incident like the one that you have testified about, that's the only possible explanation that you can think of for the viscous attack that was launched on you.  We have noted your request, we have limited capacity and  limited means as a Commission, but we will certainly seriously consider your evidence and your request and see if there is  anyway in which we can somehow try to help you to  ease the pain that you obviously still have, which we have witnessed this afternoon.\n But to  both of you, thank you very much and go well.",
