As result there was a lot of activity in Ashton and many conflicts between the police and the resident of Ou Kamp and Zolani.\nI am just trying to understand why the police would be roaming about in the township and from what we have heard in our hearing since we started, there is - there are many stories from people who were shot under circumstances that they themselves could not explain, except to say that people - police were just shooting indiscriminately.  I am trying to place what happened to you in a context for us to understand the action of the police at the time.\nYou were shot by people for something that you knew nothing about but I would just like to explain to you that it seems from what we have heard from our research department that police were shooting around townships during that period and you were one of those people who were shot at, one of the victims of that senseless shooting that seems to have taken at the time, according to our research.",

            "Thank you Pumla.  Mr Opperman you can take off the ear pieces.  We have listened to your testimony.  As my colleague indicated to you, our office has looked into the matter and has done their investigation of the circumstances in Ashton in that time and the various different meaningless, senseless activities that happened at that time.  It is very disquieting to listen to your testimony.  \nYou were just walking down the road, you did nothing wrong, suddenly you shot, it was a totally senseless act.  You lost your eye, you experienced the anxiety of a father and a breadwinner, a man who is worried that you might loose the use of your other eye and that you will just be in the way of other people, that you will be useless to them and a burden to them.\nWe have many cases like this, that as my colleague pointed out to you, where we listened, specially people who lost their eyes, and where those people who were supposed to bring law and order, and those very people became a threat to the community.\nWe have heard about the anxieties that you have mentioned to us.  The Commission has limited abilities, and within those limited abilities and with the limited resources  we have, we will try and see how we can help people.  We thank you for the time you have spent to come and tell your story for us.  We thank your wife for supporting you here and we hope that you will not come into the situation that you fear.  That you will turn out to be useless to your family because of the senseless acts of others and we wish you the very best.  Thank you.",
