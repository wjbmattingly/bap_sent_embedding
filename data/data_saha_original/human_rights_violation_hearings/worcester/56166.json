We'd last seen him at night but it was very bad in the township at that stage.  People were fighting but we didn't actually know what the cause of this confusion was.  It was dark, there no lights in the township and I was very worried for my father's safety on such a night.  My mother tried to send my sister who was born in 1972 to go and look to see if she could see where my father was as he might have been at his sister's place.  \n Koliwe went up to a place called Masakene and Koliwe found my father lying there in that place.  She came back and told my mother, she said she saw my father, I then went to see if I could find him and there he was, his jacket was torn by knife thrusts and axes.  There was a great scar on his face where he had been hacked with an axe.  A brick had been thrown at him and it was lying next to his head.  It was clear that they had just treated him mercilessly to try and overcome him.  \n After all that we decided to quickly try and get in touch with the police.  We told the other people at home that our father was there and that his left leg was broken and he could nothing.  Underneath him they people who had killed him had put a knife and also an old passbook, an old reference book.

I sent my child to find him and when she told me I hurried there and I saw him lying there.  He looked like somebody who had just been abandoned there in an abandoned place.  There was no blood.  On  his clothes there was some blood stains and it was clear that my husband had been killed.  \n When I left there I went back home and went and reported the entire thing to the police and I was never told anything about the arrest of the people who were arrested in connection with my husband's murder.   I also never saw where he was been held at the mortuary.  I didn't know who had taken him there and how.  There were some police who took him to the mortuary and after that I never saw him again.  It was not right, it was not right at all that I should stay there in my house unknowing.  \n My husband was killed and I was left with children who were still young and I've had to struggle terribly and I'm still struggling now.  I'm also struggling with bad health and my mind has actually been affected because I forget things.  That is what I can explain to you today.  Those people who were arrested didn't even stay in prison, they were given community work to do in the township, those people who killed my husband and it was not clear who had killed my husband.  It's been a terribly painful year for me.  We had to close the windows with hardboard because we couldn't replace the glass.\n We were called epiempies, we were called informers by the community.  Children would throw stones and children would persecute us in the street, we were called all sorts of names.   I never heard that Zweni had beaten any child or that he was accused of something that he didn't do.  I don't know why they killed my husband.  That's how far my story goes.  \n I've struggled to raise these kids, even this one is still in school.  She's living on pension fund.  My life goes that much ...  I'm familiar with those people, we stay together but they managed to kill my husband because they were accusing him of being an informer.  That is heartbreaking to me.  It's very painful even though it has been healed but seemingly it was not going to be healed but I've managed to reconcile.  God helped me and gave me strength to heal the wounds.  \n That is why I'm here today but it was not my wish, I didn't want to open the wounds that were already healed, I want God to look upon those who killed my husband.  I had a terrible time because my husband was killed mercilessly.   He was lying there just like a dog saying that they've killed Incatha, they've killed an informer.  These things are very painful.  They axed him and he was a fat man.  That's how I was affected psychologically and ever since then I am a very forgetful person.  My mind was affected, I was affected psychologically.  That was a traumatic time for me.  I didn't even want to come to this place, I'd rather have stayed at home but I've tried to come because I've seen people being helped.",

            "STATEMENT FROM WITNESS",
            "It was on a Friday 1986 in April when we last saw our father [Mr Douglas Ndakuthini Zweni] at home at about 8pm in the evening.  The situation in Zolani township was very tense in that there were tension between the community and the Councillor.\n My father at the time was also one of the Councillors.  So my father did not come that Friday night in April 1986.  All of us at home were worried at home especially my mother.\n My mother [Ms Nolusapho Zweni] asked my younger sister [Kholiwe Zweni] to go and look for my father around the area.  This was on a Sunday morning when she went to look for him.  Within a few minutes my sister came crying and running telling us that she saw our father lying on the street between the squatter camp area called Masekani an area called Seven Steps here in Zolani.\n My father went out alone to the spot where my father was.  When she arrived there she saw my father lying down on his back in the street.  At the time I was not at home but I heard the news and went to the spot to witness this.  When I arrived I saw him lying on his back, one leg was bent and one was flat while he was down.  There was a big knife next to him.  Also an old reference book was found underneath his body with no name or identity.\n A certain Mr Lenk who was a policeman from Ashton and Mr Mpiko who worked with my father at Langeberg went to pick up my father.  His body was put into a police van driven by Mr Lenk.  His body was taken to the mortuary.\n About three months before my father died a man from the neighbourhood, just next door by the name of Mr Timothy Tyalisisu said to me that I must tell my father that he is an informer.  This Mr Tyalisisu was once a Mayor before but was later converted and became a political activist.  So he said this while he was a political activist.   When I told my father what Mr Tyalisisu said, he said, let him come to me and say that to me.\nTo come back again to my father's death.  While he was lying down he had a big deep scar across the nose.  Seemingly he was hacked with an axe.  We are also told by Mr Qotose Maqolo who was a State witness at the Supreme Court in my father's death case.  He told us that in order to overpower my father the murders/killers threw a brick at my father's head in order to put him down on the ground.  More information can be found in Cape Town Supreme Court [1987/88]\n Investigation were done initially by Mr Lenk because he was the first to take fingerprints and other things.  Other investigations were done by other detectives, perhaps from Cape Town.\nArrest subsequently were made, people arrested were\n* Mr Tyalisisu\n* Mr Samuel Mangcola\n* Mr Kikise Msoki\n* Mr Lemi Mhlomi\nAll of them were and are still in Zolani but Samuel is no longer here in Cape Town.  They appeared in the Supreme Court in Cape Town and were given suspended sentences and had to do community work.  But that came as a surprise to us to see the murders going free without imprisonment.\n Although my mother asked me not to say anything which might lead to other tensions there were many threats from the people at Zolani directed to us.  For instance there were verbal abuses and death threats even after the death of my father.  We were blacklisted in the social and political circles.  We were a very isolated family in Zolani.  There was also stone throwing on our roof by faceless/invisible people because when we go out to check them, they were not there.\n Also the relationship with our next-door neighbours were very cold but I must confess that we are in good terms with them, we have forgotten what happened in the past.",

            "RESEARCH NOTES",
            "Mr Douglas Ndakuthini Zweni 62 a community Councillor from Zolani township was found stabbed to death in a field in the morning of Saturday 26th April 1986.  Mr Douglas Zweni was implicated in a number of Amasolomzi actions in Zolani.  Police later raided Zolani community and arrested 81 people of whom 47 were juveniles.\n By the time of Mr Zweni's death the Supreme Court of Cape Town had already issued out an interdict restraining Amasolomzi from their activities in Zolani.  A member of the Zolani community claims that Amasolomzi and the police continued with their activities despite the interdict.\n Four people were later charged in connection with the murder of Mr Zweni and other charges.  They were acquitted on murder charges but found guilty on charges of malicious damage to property and sentenced to community service for two years.  Basically, the community service they had to perform was to pick up dirt from the streets in Ashton.  The four accused were\n* Mr Lemi Mhlomi\n* Mr Timothy Thyalisisu\n* Mr Charles Msoki\n* Mr Basie Mangcola\n The controversy surrounding Mr Zweni's murder is that\nMr Zweni was alleged to have been a member of Amasolomzi who patrolled the streets of Zolani at night.Amasolomzi moved in groups during their patrols and Mr Zweni would be expected to have been part of a group.Due to Amasolomzi patrols it would be expected that no members of the community would be found roaming the streets at night.",
