They said they were going hold a placard demonstration at the Municipal offices.  The police then ordered them to turn around and move back.

Those were the pamphlets he'd been carrying and that was the 22nd.  They picked him up and took him to hospital, but he was dead on arrival at the hospital.\n On Monday the 26th of November myself, my son of 15 years, my daughter of 14 years and the one of 7 years went to town.  While we were on our way to town I went into the shop because I know this woman personally but here mother didn't want my son of 15 years to come in so I went in with my daughter aged 14 years and the one of 6 years old.   I took them by their hands and went through the side entrance right into her lounge.  I then told her that I came to her this morning with two conditions, seeing that the newspaper reported that someone carrying a broken bottle ran into the shop and she then wounded this person in the chest.  \nI asked her whether that was true, I asked her whether that in fact happened that somebody came into her shop with this broken bottle in his hand.  To both my questions she answered me and said no Dirk as there was nobody in the shop,  should I have let the child come into the shop and maybe kill me or take something that he wanted to take? She said that she saw somebody outside her shop with something that looked like a can of Doom, but she said that I mustn't saying anything about this can because she was telling me the truth but she was keeping to the statement she gave the police.",

We then prepared ourselves to go and see what was happening.  We were walking down the road and we saw some other people who were also on their way to see what the children were doing.  When I got to the shop we heard the children shouting and screaming and then they came and told me that my son was shot.\n I asked them if he was dead but they didn't reply so I ran down the road to the shop and when I got there the police shouted at me, go back, go back but I kept running until I got there.
