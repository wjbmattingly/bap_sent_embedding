<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MR BORAINE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Now having said that let me turn to you and say how very glad and grateful we are that you have joined us.  We are very pleased to  see you, we talked about age just now, and all I can say is without knowing how old you are, that you are a young man and in 1986 when the story begins of what happened to you, you must have been very-very young indeed and so it must have been particularly pain full and traumatic for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a> We want you to feel comfortable where you are, even though it is quite a strain, to talk in front of so many people.  But you are part of the healing process, we need you to share with us your story so that other people can also be healed and so that this should never happen again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a> So feel confident that you have a contribution to make, but before you do so,  I would ask you to please stand so that you can take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>MZUKISI CATHNICK MDIDIMBA Duly sworn states</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>DR BORAINE</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>Thank you very much, please be seated.   Mr Mdidimba can you hear all right on the earphones ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>MR MDIDIMBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>DR BORAINE</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>Fine,  then we can start.  1986 was a very-very bad and rough period in our history all over South Africa,  as well as in Zolani where you came from.  Do you want to tell us about what happened on that day, the 24th of May 1986. </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR MDIDIMBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>We were at a funeral it was on the 24th May 1986 on Saturday.  We dispersed after the funeral, I went together with my uncle and we went to winery - from winery  we came back at 8.00 in the evening.  I  would like to explain that our location is just below and the town is up a bit.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>When we went towards our location we could see that there was a smoke and the police searched when we met them and they said we must go further and then we went to our house.  I went to Zwelitsha that was where my uncle was staying.   We could  see that the neighbours house, it was Mr Gqoki, his house was burning.  After 8.00 we could hear sounds of cars, vans and  hippos and I heard people next door and there was insults also I could see that one of the neighbours was going passed it was Panie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>I looked through the window, I could see that Mr Nkohliso was next door.  Panie kicked him and he shot this man who was lying on the ground. I was afraid and I closed the curtains and I was afraid that they would come for me.  We could see that it was door to door search, they were proceeding towards my house.   I requested that Konayisa should help me because she was on the double  bed and I wanted to get under the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>And then I felt that my aunt would protect me. They got in and they asked where is Mathemba or Mzukisi, and he said he went out, they opened the wardrobes, they searched and when they didn't find me they said they will take my aunt, they couldn't hit my uncle because he was a cripple.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>At the same they were hitting my uncle's wife and they grabbing, taking her along.  They locked the door and they went away with the key, I think it was about  12 or 1.00 am, I struggled to come out under the bed -  from under the bed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>I could hear a cry as I listened I could hear that it was my brother, I thought that every commotion has subsided I opened the door at the kitchen and tried to peep and  as I went out I could see that Matroos has also saw me,  and he started shouting and saying there is  Mzukisi.  They started chasing me because I ran out as soon as called out for the others.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>They started chasing me as I got to the junction next to Bogat's place,  there was - I could see another police van coming.   I ran to the van and I asked for protection.  Hanson came out and he just grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and he didn't say anything and then the people who were chasing took me from - he handed me over to them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>They started hitting me with the sticks and the sjamboks.   I was assaulted for quite a long time, I was able to run away I was bleeding this time.  They started chasing me again and they were hitting me as I was having a big distance between them.  Unfortunately I slipped and then I fell on the ground.  When I was looking around I could see that Panie was already next to me I was afraid and then I ran again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>I felt that I should go directly to place so that even if I die I should die in front of my family.   I had to go past the house which was being burnt down a day before.  I couldn't see properly because the blood was just covering my eyes.  On my way back home I could see Mr Maya and the others,  and they started hitting me again. </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>I felt that okay I should surrender and go to the police van,  I went there and I felt that it is safer in the van.  When I got there I found somebody who was already shot and who was also at the back of the van.  Panie came opened the door of the van, he grabbed me and pulled me out of the van.  They started assaulting me  again -  there was lot of them.  On my right knee dislocated and I felt that I was unconscious when I regained consciousness I could feel that they were hitting me on my testicles and one of my testicles ascended.  I was taken to the police cells at Robertson, the people who in the cell assisted me and they tried to replace the knee cap and also to pull the testicles so that they descend again. </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>There was lot of youths and then all of them were released I was the only one who was detained further.  I was together with the adult offenders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>DR BORAINE</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>Mzukisi it's all right take your time there is no rush.  Mzukisi you went through a very bad time and it's very painful when you start thinking back, so don't hurry.  When you ready, you can start again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>MR MDIDIMBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>I didn't stay in the juvenile cells -  I was 15 years old at the time but I was kept with the adult offenders.   I didn't receive any medical attention.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>After a few days there were some who were taking advantage of me because I was weak and they started assaulting me and then I was taken to hospital.  That is  where I got medical treatment through Sergeant  Vatsha who was at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>I would like - I have a poem which I've written sometime back,  and I'd like - I  don't know whether I'm  allowed to read this through.  The poem is titled Alone.</p>

You mentioned that you were 15 years old and you were a juvenile but  you were put together with adults, which must have been a very bad experience apart from all the beatings that you got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>And you said that you were assaulted and you were taken to hospital.  Can you remember - I know it's a long time ago but can you remember which hospital you went to and how long you were there and  what - what special treatment they gave you - anything at all about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>MR MDIDIMBA</p>

<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MR MDIDIMBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>It was very difficult, because at times when you were alone you will  be stressful.  You would  be afraid -  you become withdrawn.  You don't even -  you didn't want to hear anything connected with politics or even if  the person says Viva.  You would be afraid because would associate with assaults and the atrocities that you experience in detention.</p>

<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>I'm going to ask you about some names that you gave us,  there are people who are making research, Chief Mabizela gave us some names who were the members of the vigilantes, I would  like to confirm if those are the same people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>MR MDIDIMBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>I think  there is because I was a very active as a political organiser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>Because even when the house was burnt I was not even there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>The lawyer has also provided us with the list of incidents to be covered by the proposed applications.  No Amnesty applications have been received yet.  Reports that Generals themselves have written to us,  are not correct and it is also incorrect that twenty  Generals are  involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>The Commission will not at this stage provide any further details of the letter.  The lawyer who wrote to us have not yet had a reply whether the news emerged which we regret and we would prefer  to conduct discussions directly with lawyers and not through the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>We are determined handle this matter carefully and correctly </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>and we will of course be consulting with the Chairperson of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>Amnesty Committee, Judge Hussan Mall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>The potential Amnesty applicants will be treated in the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>way as any other Amnesty applicants namely in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>dispassionate and even handed manner.  Thank you</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>Please stand and wait until the witnesses and their supporters families leave.</p>
