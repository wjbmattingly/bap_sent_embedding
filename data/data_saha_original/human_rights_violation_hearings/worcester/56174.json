Incatha came in with some policemen together with those who wore camouflage uniforms on.  They kicked the door, some were knocking on the windows and they assaulted us telling us we must open the door.  They were inside so we were forced to open the door but they managed to kick it and open it.  They grabbed my son, beat him and then took him outside while beating him all the time.  As I was going out to check what was happening they told me to go inside and I told them they must never tell me what to do in my own home.  \n Doyisile and his brother, they beat me, while they were doing this William Nkomiphela cam along with a knopkierie and he also beat me behind my ear.  I had a big wound that was bleeding heavily ... (interrupted)",

They said that I have too much to say and they attacked me with sjamboks.  After a while Nkomiphela came along with a knopkierie and a sjambok and he also beat me behind my ear.  I had bruises all over my body.\n While I was in that state I still had the strength to grab on of them.  A While policeman beat me up with his gun and I fell down on the cement and I tried to get up looking for them but they weren't there anymore.  I went to fetch an axe because I thought they were there but they vanished into thin air.  \n There was only 1 White policeman and he asked him what I'm going to do with the axe.  I told him that I was going to defend myself.  He insulted me, swearing at me and took the axe from me and he told me to go into the house.  I told him that I would not go inside because these were my premises and I would do what I like.  One of the other policemen came along saying, this woman is a ... I want to open her head and blow her brains away.  I said to him you can shoot, you are a murderer and I won't be the first one to be killed by you as there are many people who have been killed.   \n On the third incident I was still exchanging words with them when he said you are a racist bladdy maid, she is hardegat (stubborn).  I told them that these are my rights, I'm in my premises.  When they were trying to arrest me I asked them to allow me to get my shoes and something to put on my head but they said I must go as I am.  \n They pushed me into the van, as they were driving they picked up people along the way and they took Mvulani along and pulled him into the van.  There was a Coloured policeman inside the van who was also insulting us.  He said to us they must kill us because Le Grange has given them permission to kill us.\n We were taken to Worcester where we arrived on Sunday evening.  The following Saturday we were sent to Pollsmoor Prison where we stayed for a while until we were released on the 18th of September.  I'm talking about me.  As they came to fetch us after 9, the lady policeman where we used to sign when we were going out had already gone home so they told us to wait.  We were taken to the other policeman and after 10 this guy phoned saying the one who was supposed to take us home is departing.\n One of the detectives from Worcester said to us, you dronkgat (drunkard) you are always making these \"viva\" slogans but we didn't answer him and then Hansen said to this child ...  We didn't answer his insults.  He said you old lady you're always making the \"viva\" slogans and I asked, when did I do these things.  \n I asked this man who is going to transport us home and he said you are going alone.  I was so surprised that I asked him again if I am going alone and he said yes.  He said I must not be frightened.\n While I was at home Hansen repeated his words again saying, you old lady and the White policeman said no please, leave the lady alone.

            "I am an adult female residing at no 48 Building Street at Zolani township in Ashton.  During the State of Emergency period, that is, on the 15th of June 1986.   I was at home with my son Crosby Loyiso Day sitting in the sitting room as others were in the bedroom, namely Mimi Day Betye, Thulisa Betye and others who were still young at that time.\n It was at about 800pm and we were busy eating our late supper.  I heard a terrible knock at my door.  Whilst listening to that knock I heard other knocks at my windows and I decided to look  as my window curtain was not closed.  Through the window I saw white policemen.  Whilst there were those policemen next to the windows, others were busy  damaging my door in order to access it as it was closed and locked.\n They managed to open the front door and I realised later that it was damaged as they used force to open it.  After the door was opened I saw Ndoyisile Ndabeni and Sayinile Teacher Ndabeni in front entering my house.  The first thing they  did was to insult my son Crosby Loyiso Day for not opening the door when they were knocking.  They thereafter went straight to him accusing him of being Cheeky and assaulted him.  Both of them beat him with their sjamboks.\n Loyiso in attempting to defend himself grabbed Ndoyisile  and put him down and strangled him as he was lying down.  Ndoyisile pulled out his pistol with the intention of  shooting Loyiso as they could see that he was being overpowered [my assumption] Nodiyisile was stopped by Mr Joubert after being asked by Mr Gamleki Mxhamelu Day whether to pull out  a gun was in the line with the Law.\n After this  we went outside the house and I asked the police why Ndoyisile and Teacher assaulted Loyiso - what did he do - there was no reply from the police, instead it was my turn to be beaten up.  I was beaten by Ndoyisile, Teacher and Mr Nkomiphela.  Mr Nkomiphela knocked me with a knopkierie, he was carrying, that is a stick with round head, on my head at the back.  \n He knocked me twice, as a result I was bleeding furiously as his knocks caused a wound on my head.  I grabbed Ndoyisile.  When I was about to hit him a certain white policeman whom I believe was from Montagu, knocked or hit me on my back with the back of a rifle.  I became extremely angry.  I took an axe which I  was going to  use to harm Ndoyisile and Teacher.  Unfortunately or fortunately for  them, they were already gone by the time I had the axe with me.\n There were only two white policemen closer to me now though others were just all over the place inside my yard.  In other words those two policemen were the ones I ended up dealing with them.  The first thing they did was to take the axe away from me.  One of them, viz. the one who hit me said I should go inside the house otherwise I would be shot.  The last part of his sentence is the one which made me very angry.\n In my reply I said they should rather kill me as they are used to killing innocent people.  He then pointed his rifle at me and put it on my forehead three times.  He was stopped by his colleagues but he persisted in pointing his rifle at my forehead.  At last he stopped because his colleague was saying to him that he had to stop. \n Thereafter he said that I  deserved to be locked up  in a police cell.  I was then put inside the SAP van by force.  I was badly treated seeing that I was an adult woman.  We were then taken to Worcester Prison and thereafter transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town as others were transferred to Victor Verster in Paarl.  I stayed there for  three months and were released on 18th September 1986.",
