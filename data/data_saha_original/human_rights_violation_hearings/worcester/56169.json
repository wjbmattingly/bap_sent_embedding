            "Thank you Chair.  I have a few housekeeping announcements to make as we call them.  Firstly  to explain the use of these translation devices to you.  Unfortunately we don't have enough of these to go on to every single chair so I would ask you to share, particularly if you do understand the language which is being used by the witness - if you could give your headset to someone who does not understand that there are a fair number of these available in the hall.\nThe headphones plug into the receiver at the back and there are two buttons on either side.  One with numbers on - those - that button is to choose the language which you want to hear.  Number 1 is Afrikaans, Number 2 is English and Number 3 is Xhosa so you can choose the language you would like to be hearing and then there is a volume button on the other side which you can make louder or softer.  \nThe piece of apparatus which actually transmits the sound are these two black boxes up here so you need to make sure that the front of your device with the glass bubbles on it is pointing to those black boxes otherwise your reception will be very poor.\nPlease at lunch time and teatime leave these devices on your chair, do not take them away with you.  We need to recharge them so they must stay behind.\nSecondly for everyone who has cell phones, could you please turn them off and that includes people on the panel.\nWe ask you to stay seated whilst witnesses are testifying.  It is very disruptive if people are walking in and out.  Obviously if someone arrives and wants to come in we will allow that but please don't get up and walk around whilst the witnesses are testifying.\nIf anyone here today would like to make a statement to the Truth Commission, we do have facilities for taking your statements and you should talk to one of the two gentlemen at the back of the hall, Kelvin and  Sekebo and they will make an arrangement for your statement to be taken.\nFinally the programme has omitted to put down morning tea which will be at about 10h30, so we are not going to be sitting here all the way through till lunch time, there will be a break at 1030.  Also I am sure you have noticed this, on the last day it says Thursday the 26th of June, the last day is Wednesday, 26th June, thank you Chair.",

            "I greet you Ms Maria.  We have started this a long time ago.  We are opening wounds that were healed a long time ago.  When we met as women congress you told us it was very difficult for the past two weeks.\nWe do understand that it is like that, but the wound can't be healed without disturbing it again.  So we thank you for your to come forward.  I will start by giving a brief - I will just give a brief description of what happened during those days when Nation passed away and what was the cause of his death.   Nation is the son of Maria Bahume.  That's  the name he was known of, he was the SRC leader.  He had a high portfolio in this organisation.  He was shot -  that was on the 16th August, 1985.  He was shot by policemen known as Security Police.  \nMs Bahume will give us the whole story but I want her to give you a - I want her to tell you how the situation was in Worcester -  Zwelethemba Location.\nPerhaps another important thing about Zwelethemba is its very far from Worcester.  People from Zwelethemba they think it's another town, separated from Worcester, that's how our location were built.  Things started to be difficult between Zwelethemba and Worcester and our location amongst the Coloureds and blacks there started to be difficulty in 1983.  We had the build up.\nIn the whole South Africa things were happening because our students had their organisations there was COSAS - one of those organisation, there was a very funny feeling during the location - people were emotional.  I would say amongst the blacks and the Coloureds -  they were all working together, there was no - they were co-operated there was nothing that you can't even differentiate that this is the organisation of the blacks and the other ones for the Coloureds.\nThat's what we noticed by the time we arrived here in Worcester.  The way youth and the adults in the community were fighting against the police.  Blacks and Coloureds were in co-operation - good co-operation working together.\nI will just be brief, during 1983 we know that UDF was being established in South Africa.  It started here in Worcester in August 1986 but there was women's organisations - one of them was United Women's Organisation.  There was another one for the community known as Worcester Civic Communities Association.  That was the one who had to look amongst the community's interests.  During that time the  Government of - the apartheid Government had already decided and thought about the community councillors.  They wanted to deploy them throughout the location, that's where the trouble started and where the misunderstanding started, because the community couldn't accept the community councillors.\nAnd then the Worcester Civic Association decided to go to the Regional Administration Board to go and complain telling them that the community councillors are not welcome into the community, that's where the problem started because policemen wanted and forced the community councillors to be in the locations.\nThat's where the women's organisation from Worcester decided and they were united as black women from the black community and on the other side from the Coloured Community.  Women get together, go to Cape Town to meet the people from the Black Sash.\nWe've met those people during the past week.  Di Bishop, Mary Burton were one of them.  They came here to Worcester, they've started an advisory office here in Worcester.  They were trying to help people, they wanted to have negotiations that people must not be humiliated.  Policemen started the violence  in the Worcester Civic Association - between the Worcester Civic Association and the Councillors and the people who are enforcing the law.  People were arrested in big masses.  During 1983 they were detained, put in jail, that's where the advise office came in that was started by the Black Sash.\nEver since then there was no rest, there were always fights between - amongst the policemen and the community and the councillors were forced to resign at the end of 1983 so they did.  But it didn't end there because the law enforcers they forced the community councillors to be amongst the community - students and the community were against that aim.\nThere were meetings children couldn't attend the school - they also organised their meeting, it was just a messed up situation - policemen against the community.  Ever since then from June 1985 while the people like Goniwe - people were  chasing after Goniwe - the whole South Africa was emotional, even here in Worcester there was that emotion.\nAnd then after that the community of Worcester they went to the Regional Security Board demanding that we don't want the community councillors in own location.  So we don't like the rent fees and the electric fees to be increased because - so the Worcester  Civic Ass attended that and the policemen will get into masses in the location with big vans and hippos - those big vans known as hippos and people were arrested.  Some of them had too march to protest against the arrest of the people.\nAnd then in July the students decided not to go to school for the whole week.  To stay away and they had to look at this matter. Nation, the son of Ms Maria, was one of those students who were leading the youth and they tried to convince the other youth that they must discuss and negotiate about the policemen who were fully involved in the community.  And they tried to make their meetings in Ms Maria's house - it's when the policemen tried to disturb the school boycotts they were chasing students.\nAt that time there was no-one that got shot, although there were shots - they would just get injured -  no-one was shot dead then.  And then in August, it's when Nation was the first victim in the whole of Worcester to be shot dead by the policemen.  Those who were called security policemen.\nSo Nation Nkosane was the first victim.  And then after that women marched to the police station who blocked the whole of Zwelethemba surrounding the whole of Zwelethemba there was only one entrance in Zwelethemba.  That's  how our location have been built - locations have been built all over South Africa.\nWhen they were looking for someone they knew there was only one entrance, one exit then the women marched protesting against the policemen amongst the community, they didn't want them inside.  \nThere were so many policemen that people thought they were going to kill us as a whole in the Zwelethemba community.  We were so afraid of that.  So we will call upon Ms Maria to tell us firstly about Nation.  How was he convinced and got involved in the SRC.  How fully was he involved in that organisation?",

Some of the police came in and went to the children's rooms and then the others came to my room.  We had to explain who we were.  We did as they wanted.\nI can remember when Miriam was asked she mistakenly said she is Mildred.  One of the policemen called her, she was ordered to go along with the police.  When she was going out, she said to me - please phone my place inform  them that I  had been taken by the police.  When the police learned that he  was communicating telephonically with someone else they disconnected the phone and broke the wires and then they took Miriam away.\nThereafter they continued coming all the time asking for Marshall.  When Marshall was asked what his name was he said he would Vuyisili and he would deny that he is Marshall.  And this continued for quite a long time until the day of the funeral.\nAnd we could see that some of them were high ranking officials from the police and they would come with documents - they gave us restrictions and telling us what type of funeral arrangements we should do.  They stipulated the number of people who were supposed to attend the funeral, they also informed us that when the day which is - the child supposed to be buried should be a day during the week.  \nI said it would be difficult to say we should stipulate the number because this was a student and he was very popular.  There would be neighbours who would be attending and some of the schoolchildren would be coming along.  So they said it would be all right then to allow as many people as possible but they didn't want any demonstration, they didn't want any placards, nothing out of order should take place.\nAnd then on the day of the funeral we went to the minister of religion and then the police also went to the minister and stated that the minister who will be leading the procession should use a certain street which is extremely out of the location.  And then when the minister was doing as he was ordered by the police, the people were surprised because they thought he had lost his way.  And then he had to explain to the people that no, this was the order from the police and he didn't want any chaos to take place.  So that is why he was obeying the orders.",

There were vans, the big hippos and the police were armed.  They were pointing their guns at our range - directly at us.\nThey  used also another street so that there should be a blockade so that nobody comes to the street where there is a funeral.  The others were just beyond the main road and they were just guarding the procession and how it was going to be conducted.\nWhen we got to the hall or the venue, the Minister was still holding the sermon and during that period the police came nearer.  We could see that a lot of them were coming nearer the hall.  We could realise that something terrible was going to happen. Whilst we were still listening to the sermon there was a  hailer and there was an announcement through the hailer that we should come out of the hall.  \nWe were ordered to disperse and the minister said also we must abide by the rules because this is what the police had said and they had even stipulated the time.\nWhen one of the neighbours who was also on the other side of the room and then he also - when he came nearer he was prevented by the police to be part of the funeral.  When we were taking the - the coffin was taken and put on the hearse and  there were gunshots again.  Some people ran away and jumped through the windows.  There were stampede - others were jumping over the fences and most of the people now wanted to go back home because they were afraid that it was going to be a massacre should they followed the procession.\nSo most of the people disbanded and ran away.  One of the men said he said he saw one woman who was lying on the ground.  We continued - we couldn't do anything because we were afraid so we just went along and continued the procession.  We were now few and there were a lot of police.\nThere is another road which was corrugated and it was also the road which we were ordered to use.  So we were escorted by the vans and the police to the graveyard.   During this period when we reached the destination there were already people who were already loaded in the van and they were  claimed to have been arrested.  We were all panicking and we did the work so quickly because we were afraid that there might be something terrible again and then we rushed up back to my place.\nWe learned that there was one child who was shot during the period when there was that stampede.

            "Ms Bahume, we have listened very carefully to your story, we have taken many notes.  We have also especially made a note of your own circumstances and the requests you have made to the Commission.  The Commission will do everything it can to be of assistance to you.  We will  obviously investigate further.\n I want to express to you the Commission's love and care.  You have been very brave.  We know that you've felt it very deeply and to lose a young son is very hard.  We trust that God will bless you and assist you as you continue.\nThank you very much for coming and go well, thank you.",
