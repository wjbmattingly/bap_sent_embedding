<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> I think we would actually like to call Mkijima Mnguni to come forward now if it's possible because the incidents which Sipho was just relating now, particularly with regard to Abram is directly related to the testimony of Mrs Mnguni.  If she could please.   Mr Mnguni.  We're changing the order.  We're sorry for that.  We have changed the order of the programme slightly to have Mr Mnguni to come forward.  We thought that it is appropriate given that the last witness was speaking about the funeral of Abram Mnguni who was the son of Mr Johannes Mnguni and we thought that it would be best to hear Mr Mnguni's testimony now and we will call Anna Motloung a bit later, so please just bear with us.  Good afternoon Sir, and welcome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Mr Mnguni you're coming to speak about your son Abram and the events which led to his death and also the funeral.  Doctor Randera is going to assist you with your testimony but before I hand you over to Doctor Randera, may I please ask you to raise your right hand to take the oath.  Just raise your right arm.  Do you swear that the testimony you're about to give will be truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Thank you very much Mr Mnguni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Mnguni, good afternoon.  I'm not going to spend any more time.  If you could just go ahead and tell us what happened on the first of May 1986.  The first of May is recognized as workers day.  Just tell us what happened on that day.  Why there was a stay-away and then what happened to your son Abram.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I was at home.  There was a girl standing with him outside.  I just heard from the girl that he's been shot.  It was the girl who alerted me because I was inside the house.  They were throwing teargas canisters so I was inside he house because I tried to avoid being outside.  The girl approached me to alert me that my son had already been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did you then go out and see what happened ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Yes, I did.   It was true, he was laying on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Was dead already by then ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I think he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can you tell us what happened after that Mr Mnguni ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> The boys took him into the cupboard.  We could see that the damage has been done and he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What occurred ?  Did the other boys take him to the hospital ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Yes, they took him to the doctor.  He was already dead.  It was just a formality to take him to the doctor because we were aware that he was dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> You want to now tell us what happened on the day of the funeral.  How many days later was the funeral ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> It was on the thirteenth.  They never allowed us to carry on with the funeral.  They harassed us and they kept throwing teargas canisters on the day of the funeral.  It was terrible and it was chaotic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What happened after that, Mr Mnguni ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> They took the corpse with and buried him themselves.  I went to them to find out where they had buried my son.  They told me he was buried in Greylingstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> As I understand it, they just took the body away without any permission from you and buried the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And up to this day, you still don't know where your son is buried ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> They told me that he was buried in Greylingstad.  I went there to try and locate the grave and there was one gentleman who knew me and he pointed at the place where he was buried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How old was you son, Mr Mnguni ?  How old was Abram when he was killed ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> He was eighteen years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And he was still a student at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Yes, he was a student.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Do you have any other children ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Yes, I do have other children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Mnguni, tell us what was actually happening in Siyathemba on that day ?  You said earlier on that there was chaos and the police and soldiers were firing teargas canisters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> They had set the store alight and previously there was nothing then they started.  That was when things started.  Turmoil.  People were not fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Who set the store alight ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> So as far as you know it was meant to be a peaceful day with people protesting for recognition of Worker's Day, the first of May and then events got out of control ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Yes, there was nothing, it was quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What about Abram himself, was he a Comrade ?  Was he part of the youth structures in Siyathemba ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Not to my knowledge.  He never mentioned whether he was a Comrade or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What would you wish to the Truth Commission to do,  Mr  Mnguni ?  What is your wish ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I would like to have some compensation because I believe that if he was alive, he would be taking care of me and supporting me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you Mr Mnguni, I have not further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Mr Mnguni, where was the mother at that time ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> You mean my wife.  She's around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> And the mother couldn't even have challenged the police to take the corpse to ....................................</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> No, she never made any attempt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> As it is, if I understand you well, you talk of compensation.  You are not talking about the chance that the remains be taken from Greylingstad to where you are right now ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Most of the people do suggest that the body should be exhumed from where it is and buried locally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Who are these many, Mr Mnguni ?  Who at the time of the death of your child did not protest that he should be taken to Greylingstad but now you say they would protest for the remains to be brought back to where you are ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Those are Comrades I'm referring to who were present at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> In what Class was your son at school at the time ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I think he was in Standard Seven.  That is Form Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> Please people.  Can people please just settle down and be quiet ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What did his teachers say when he died and when he had to be buried and when the police took the corpse and buried it where they wanted it ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> They said nothing to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> They couldn't even help you to get to the police station where the whole issue of the post-mortem or inquest could have been held ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> No, nothing to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Mnguni, just one last question.  Did you lay a charge at the police station against the killing of your son ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did anything come out of it ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> They called me in.  When I went there I was told that I was talking nonsense and they will never pay me anything.  The Government won't compensate me in any form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> And the matter of your son being buried ?  Did you take up that matter as well, Mr Mnguni ?  The fact that the coffin was taking away from you and the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I did take that further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> How did you take up that matter ?  What did you do ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MNGUNI:</span> I went to report the matter to the police at the police station.  I asked how they can they do ?  They laughed at me and mocked me.  That was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">DR ALLY:</span> It's very difficult to know what to day in a situation like this.  It was hard enough for you to lose your son in the way in which you did and then on top of that for  you and your family to be subjected to that treatment where your son's coffin is taken away and your son is buried at a place away from your home and  from the community.  We have heard your requests, your request for compensation.  We've also heard what you've said that members of the community have said that there should be some form of justice and that your son should be re-buried in Siyathemba.  Also that the body should be exhumed from where it's buried in Greylingstad and we will certainly look into those requests.  In the recommendations that we make, we will certainly take into account what you have said.  Once again thank you very much for coming to speak to us and to share your painful experience with us.  Thank you.</p>
