They hacked me and they were sure they had killed me.   People thought I was dead and my relatives went around searching for me.  They even used to go around to hospitals looking for me.\n I went to Orlando for a short period and found that my health was not good and I had to come back to Alexandra.  I stayed in Alexandra at night. I did not have a place to sleep.  I left my house intact but today I do not have a home to go to.  I live with other people, just like a slave. I do not have a job.  I am hungry. I have children. Even my children are spoilt because they do not have parents to give them parental guidance.  I myself, I cannot do things for myself.  I do not have the power to work anymore. I have \nALEXANDRA TRC/GAUTENG\n2 S MABUZA\ntaken everything I possessed; my cars, everything. I was left with nothing.  I have to borrow clothes to wear from other people up until today.\n I have had to borrow money from people. I have not repaid this debt.  I do not know why I am living, because I am suffering.  Whether I sleep with a meal in my stomach or not, nobody knows or cares.  My parents cannot support me at this stage, together with my children.  They are unable to support all of us.  My poverty is the same as theirs. We are like living corpses.\n Unfortunately my father died when I was young. I have to take his place.  Unfortunately,  people have taken everything I possessed. I do not know where to start.  This is what led me to come to the Truth Commission, because up till today I am still worried as to what happened.  The people did this are still alive, they eat very well and walk around in the streets.\n I have nothing else to say.",

It is one which we have heard of several times in the past few days.  It tells of a time which is not very long ago, where anger was obviously playing a big role.  What we will try and do is follow up for you the whole question of your pension and also follow up what we can in terms of the report and why nothing was done about your case.  We cannot offer you comfort, but obviously you draw strength yourself in the fact that you survived this dreadful attack,  and the fact that you do have people around you who can support you and who show and give you strength. We realise that in a community like Alexandra, this is a very important factor in everybody's life.  We salute that and we salute you for your courage and for your determination to keep going.\n Thank you very much for coming.  Thank you.\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
