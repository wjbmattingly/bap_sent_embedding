<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good afternoon, Mrs Vilakazi.  I am very pleased that you could come.  Can you hear me, is that all right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you start giving your evidence, I would like to ask if you could take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">ALINA VILAKAZI:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I will ask Yasmin Sooka, the Commissioner, to lead your evidence.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Welcome, Mamma, to the Commission.  Mamma, tell me about your son, Abraham, what did he do before this incident happened to him.  Tell me a little bit about him and then tell me about what you know about what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He was working. I went to the farm.  When I came back I found that he was shot and that he was in hospital.  He stayed in hospital for a long time and I thought he would recover but he died later on.  He left a son behind who was seven years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What did your son do and how old was he at the time that he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I don't know. I wasn't here.  When I arrived I found him in hospital. What I know is that he was working at one of the firms in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Do you know who shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>2 MRS VILAKAZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I don't know.  I was told he was shot by police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Do you know where he had been shot, Mamma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> They said he was shot at Malborem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Mamma, why do you think he was shot by the police?  Did somebody tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Nobody told me as to why he was shot, even himself in hospital he couldn't speak, so he couldn't tell as to what happened.  I was surprised, because when I left him he was well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> After he died was there any court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Mamma, was your son involved in any political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, he wast a very good child, well-behaved and he wasn't involved in political activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Was anybody else shot at the same time as your son was shot?  Do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I don't know, I just discovered that he was shot. I don't know anything more about his friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Is there anything else you would like to tell the Commission before you finish your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, I have nothing, except what I have said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Listen carefully to me.  I know that you were not there when this incident occurred. However, if any great event happens, people normally talk about it.  Didn't you hear from rumours as to finding a clue what happened at the time?  This is going to help us in investigating the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I didn't find any clue or hear any rumours as to why he was shot.  I tried to call his friend and ask him as to what happened. He didn't come and even when I went to</p>

<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>the funeral the friend didn't come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> This friend, is he a neighbour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> He stayed in the township, but after he discovered that my son was killed, he tried to distance himself from us, so we couldn't reach him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> At the time when you buried your son, the people who came to comfort you, were they comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> It was our family, his friends and friends of my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> The other friends which you mentioned, you said they came to the funeral. After the funeral didn't you hear any rumours about the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I didn't hear anything, because they don't want to tell me the truth as to what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> These friends, are they still around, many of his friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Yes, two of them died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> The one that you mentioned, is he still around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> No, he is not, he passed away. There were two friends, the one of them he was working with and the other was working somewhere else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEROKE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The rest of your family, what other children do you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> I had four sons, one died, the one I am talking about. I am left with four sons and have three daughters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is your husband still with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> My husband is still alive and we are staying together with our grandchildren and our children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>4 MRS VILAKAZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What we try and do in the Commission is to try and bring some light to the story.  But I think one of the most difficult things for any of us to come to terms with, is not knowing. That is probably one of the most difficult things to realise, is to feel the grief, to know that someone has died, and not to know why, not to know the circumstances of why they have died.  We feel very much ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VILAKAZI:</span> Can you please repeat the question?  I don't know what you mean?  Do you mean the one who died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct - microphone not switched on) ... what we will try and do as a Commission and how we feel.  Because I think all of us feel a great sense of grief with you, but a sense also of frustration, because we can't help.  We can't offer you any consolation in your grief.  Although we can understand it very much, because we have heard stories like this, and we can understand particularly how difficult it is when you don't know actually what happened.  We salute you for your strength and for your fortitude and thank you very much for coming to tell your story, because it tells what was happening, it tells a story of what happened here in those days not very long ago.  Where we can help we will try as much as we can to help, and we will come back to you with that.  Thank you very much for coming.  Thank you.</p>
