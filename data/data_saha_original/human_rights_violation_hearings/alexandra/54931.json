Here in Alexandra there are many reverends and we form a group which works with the community.  I will start from 1986, I will forget about 1976 because others are coming to report on that. During 1986 - before I go on I would like to ask the commission as to whether they have  called all the people who were involved to come and ask for\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MZAMBU\nforgiveness for things that they have done within the community and also as to why they didn't come before the Commission.   Or maybe they would ask we, we have seen them to point them out to come before the Commission.  People within the Alexandra community have been harassed in a horrible manner therefore they had to stand on their feet, especially reverends and bishops, to help the people.  It was terrible, especially when it comes to burying our people.  I have a letter, I don't know whether I can be given permission to read them, were written by magistrates, refusing us to bury our people who were killed by government officials.",

Those police used to hit at any target, they hit all the people, young children and also women.  And these are the people I am asking about, why don't they come out and explain as to what they did.  For example there was one lady who was shot at the gate, they just shot her while she was standing at her gate.  She is also one of the people we had to bury.  As a group we met 1983, it was somewhere before the 16th May.  We were reverends and we were trying to find out as to how we can help the people, especially those who lost relatives during the violence.  In my statement I said 13th Avenue and it was 10th Avenue.  We couldn't go out because we had to also go for a hiding and escape because it\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MZAMBU\nwas like a battlefield.  People were killed at the time, they were inside their house and they were surrounded by police.   Their names were, the first one is Victor Banda, Colin Dothli, Elias Nduli, Woes Dube, Saphinium Dagane, Abion Makateni, Bele Sangwane, Joseph Pefadu.  All these people were killed in one house which was surrounded by police and I would like to know where are these police who killed these people, why don't they come before the Commission and say we did this and that.",

            "As I said, we were in church.  I didn't know what they were doing but what we heard during the service was that these were comrades, they were just sitting there.  What is surprising is that while we were still preparing to bury them the magistrate in this letter before me, it is written enquiry to Mr L Mendelsohn.  This was from the Chief Magistrate in Randburg.  When we went to him he blankly refused to give us permission to bury our dead in a mass funeral.  In my opinion I think that people should be given a chance to bury their people.  And I think he was wrong for refusing us to bury the dead.  And that is the reason why I would like this magistrate to come before the Commission as to why he refused to give us permission to bury our children. I would like to say that some of our people ... bury them on mass funeral - so to bury them on mass funeral we assist these people.  We as ministers we go around asking\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 MZAMBU\nfor some donations to help us and bury the dead ones.  That is the reason to bury them.  If the excuse of the magistrate to refuse us the permission to bury our dead ones I think he was very much wrong.  If his excuse is that he was trying to get the safety to the community or the properties of the people he should have at least got some more security to escort us and not to refuse us to bury our dead ones.  This was later granted to us through the ANC and ACO.  ACO is Alexandra Civic Organisation.  They got us a lawyer, Mr Huyzen.  We made an appeal to the magistrate saying that to the magistrate if he refuses to give us the permission to bury our dead ones he is prepared to take that immediately to court.",

Only the relatives can know about their ages.  Some of them I could just estimate and say, well like one of them Makateni (indistinct) organisation of (indistinct) so his sons, I know them.  This Makateni I know.  So the others I may not be able to know.  But all I know again about that Banda was shot dead while he was from work at Third Avenue and (indistinct) at 9th Avenue.  The magistrate in turn ... in a letter which was written by Mr Huyzen the attorney, he says here in the letter\n\"Permission is hereby granted in terms of the authorisation given to me by the Honourable Minister of Law and Order as contained in GN 582\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 MZAMBU\ndated 27 March 1986 to hold a gathering at the Alexandra cemetery for the burial of the undermentioned deceased on Saturday 17 May 1988 at times set out below\".\nNow it reads as follows, the time which was scheduled by the government now to us to tell us how should we bury our dead ones.  He said that Banda, his funeral service will start at half past one and to half past two.  Colin Dothli, his service will start at two o'clock to three o'clock.  Elias Nduli was scheduled to be buried at half past two to half past three.  Woes Dube from three to four.  Saphinium Dagane half past three to half past four.  Albion Makateni two o'clock to three o'clock.  Bele Sangwane, half past two to half past three.  Jacob Pefadu three o'clock to four o'clock.  And we were told that only the ordained ministers will perform on that service.  And the restrictions which were given to us is that the bodies will not be carried on the shoulders but into the hearse.  People were angry by that time.  Such restrictions they wouldn't stand for them.  They couldn't stand definitely for them and we couldn't do nothing even if those restrictions were given to us to conduct them, we couldn't do nothing.  The ministers which were scheduled to conduct the service, it was Reverend Madisha, Reverend A Matuma, Reverend M M Dhlamini, Reverend J L Makweba, Reverend S Mavula, Reverend Ganagomo, Reverend N A Ntombeni, Reverend Langa.  I was scheduled to be an MC on the (indistinct).  Another funeral which we - in fact let me just finish up again this part.  How we buried these people we went, I personally went with the other comrades from ACO to Puni's Undertakers at Lenasia.  We asked them for full funeral service.  If those people are here I would\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 MZAMBU\nlike to thank them very much.  Those are the people which did the great job for our people. It was very fine what they did, they gave us free of charge full service of the whole service.  Not only in this funeral.  In the following mass funerals that we had which is ....",

I don't know whether these people came before the Commission but I also informed that I was coming to give a statement that they should also come and give their evidence, if possible.  At First Avenue it was a night vigil.  In this night vigil people which were killed, it is Leon Pamapanga from 154 Second Street, Alexandra, Eric Jawa from number 14 First Avenue, Mike Mlovo 34 Fifth Avenue, Cilo Pering 57 20th Avenue, Sipho Gadebe 134 Fifth Avenue, Sidwell Jantjie 130 16th Avenue.  Now his body was transferred to East London.  There was also a body that we identified at the government mortuary as I was appointed to escort the bereaved one to go and identify their dead ones.  Bodies which were picked up out at Alexandra it was Jacob Dhlamini and Timot Mabundla, Zwelitsha Mbumka, Ntandi Sizwe Napai, Dimonti Ramagula.  We buried them.  I had this lady which was now here, she said that there are some bodies - her child was killed and not been found.  I got a list of bodies which I took from there, the government mortuary, which people I couldn't get them to go and identify their bodies.  Probably it was because it was difficult to identify your body, the bodies there they were dismembered, you couldn't -ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 MZAMBU\nthey were beyond identification.  Some of them they were packed in a big hall up to a certain - but bodies from Alexandra which were not identified, the names I don't have them but the body numbers I have got them.  601, body number 601 it was left there unidentified.",
