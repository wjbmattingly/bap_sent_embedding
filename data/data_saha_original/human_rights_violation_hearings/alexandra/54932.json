He use to come\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 A S NDLOVU\nlooking for Michael.  When we asked them why do you come in numbers in this household in Dunz looking an 18 year old boy?  What has he done?  They could not explain to us as to exactly what wrongs he has done.  \n After that Michael went to a funeral at Second Avenue.  There was an old lady who had passed away and it was during the week and they had a funeral.  While we were sleeping on that date, the Mayor of Alexandra came to our place to tell us Michael had been killed at Second Avenue.  This is the reason why I came to give a statement here, just to find as to who were the perpetrators and also why did they kill our younger brother.  I would like them to come forward and explain why they killed him.",

I think that is the reason why he is beating me up. I remember, well, one day we were sent to Checkers.  I saw this child running away and I asked him, why are you running away from me.  He said to me, there is Alex coming.  He is going to kill me.  I said to him if he had to get me, he is not going to kill you, he better kill both of us.

He was not aware these were Inkatha members.  He saw police coming with two Hippos.  The ANC office responded that they would call police to come and protect them at the night vigil.

Now we can clearly see that this freedom that we are having at the moment did not come easy.  Especially concerning the youth for their involvement.  We would like to thank them because they sacrificed their lives for this freedom of ours today.  It is them who brought about this new Government which we elected into power and this shows that we did not get this freedom free of charge.  I do believe that all of us will remember that many people died, children died and many people were killed and also that today this freedom, we shall treat it in a good manner, with respect because it was acquired through the blood of many people who were killed.  We would also like to thank you.  Even if you did not pay for this freedom.  However, we would like to thank you\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 A S NDLOVU\nbecause whatever happened, you did play a part and I would like to encourage us to be determined even if we know that we are enjoying the freedom and the peace.
