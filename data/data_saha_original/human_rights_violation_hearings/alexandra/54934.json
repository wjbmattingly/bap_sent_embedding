I reside at number 63 8.\n I do not know what happened about my son, Donald, because I was not around when they killed my son, but the people came to me, they came to my house.  The boy that was with Donald is the one who came to tell me what happened about my son.  My son was killed by the Boers at Fourth Avenue.  I do not know, but this boy told me that he was \nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 J NKUEMYANE\nwith him.  \n The left on a Friday.  They were going to Tembisa.  They came back from Tembisa.  When they were on their way home they were in Club 65.  On the Fourth Avenue they find police who were standing there at the Fourth Avenue.  This boy told me that my son ran away as the other people were running away and the police chased them away, but this boy did not run away.  That is when my son was shot because they were being chased by the police and they were running away.  That is when my son was shot.  I did not see anything.  I just heard the people saying what happened.  I heard all this from this boy who was with my son.  We buried Donald.\n They said the case was going to be heard at Randburg Police Station.  When his father went to the court he was told that the witnesses did not come.  They said he must bring this boy who was with Donald on that day, but it was very difficult for my husband to get this boy to go to the court.  They said they want other group of witnesses.  The third witness except this Moreni.  They said that the case was heard and there was no witness.  Until today there was nothing that was done.  That is why I decided to come to the Truth Commission.  I think they are going to help me because we had problems that our cases were not heard.  I know that the Truth Commission can help us to investigate what happened.  That is why I have taken this decision to come to the Truth Commission.  \n I gave the Truth Commission people the statement and the letters from the police and the other copies.  I gave them all the evidence that I had with me.  This is the end of my story.",
