            "In 1985 I met with Cosas members singing at school.  It was the first time I supported them.  I joined the Cosas organisation.  They killed one boy in 1985.  Things went on.  In 1986, it was in December, we were attending a night vigil on 19th Avenue at Jingles Magoti's house.  Whilst we were attending the night vigil we were standing outside.  Policemen arrived.  They had painted their faces in black, they had berets on.  People became scared and they were told they must go inside the house.  They decided they would rather go home to die at their respective homes.  They didn't trust that they would be safe inside the house.  They started throwing tear-gas canisters.  They threw tear-gas canisters and this canister landed in front of me.  This choked me, I inhaled it.  I tried to run away.  When I tried to run away I fell inside a drum.  As I fell inside this drum the policemen were already there.  It was two policemen. Black policemen. I only know one of them.  ALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MATJILA\nHis name is Mtebi.  I don't know the second one.  And four white policemen.  They kicked me.  They hit me with batons as well.  They kicked me many a time.  I think I lost consciousness.  I fainted.  I don't know what happened to these white men.  When I came to I found myself in hospital, at the General Hospital.  They bandaged me on the left shoulder.  I had fractured my arm, my left arm.  They kicked my teeth out as well.  Even in my forehead I was injured.  That is how I was injured.",

I was deployed in the parking area of the cars.  To watch the cars, to be on guard.  I was pacing up and down, guarding the cars.  It was in the evening.  I just heard a white man saying here he is and there was a gunshot.  I was so frightened and I fell on the ground and then I rolled and I hid myself under the car so that they shouldn't be able to shoot me.  Whilst I was there some policemen came.  They thought I was shot.  They took me to the hall.  Whilst I was there at the hall Comrade Popo Molefe was there and Paul Mashatele and Barbara Hogan was working at regional office.  They gave me water because I was frightened.  Then I became better.  It is Paul Mashatele and Barbara and Popo Molefe.  They took me to Cleveland police station.  When we got to the Cleveland police station they told us that they cannot take a statement there.  It must be taken to GP police\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 MATJILA\nstation and we proceeded there.  They took the statement there and we told them as to how the policemen attempted to shoot me.  And thereafter we came back.  They told me that they will come and fetch me because the meeting will proceed.  The policemen came back to fetch me after a few days and they took me to the GP police station.  When we got there they asked me that same question as to what happened on that particular day.  I told them again the very same story as to what happened on that particular day.  They took me back to where I was working and that was the end of it.",

Secondly they took out his teeth, they extracted his teeth.  He is weak.  He can hardly move for a long time.  He is not fit enough.
