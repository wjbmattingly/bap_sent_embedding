            "My son Silas on the 7th March 1985, it was on a Sunday, he said he was going out.  Since he left at that time he never came back again.  On the Monday we started enquiring about him.  I told people to go and look for him at his friends but he was not there.  Even the friends were asking where Silas was.  That happened until the whole week.  We were surprised that how can he disappear for the whole week.  We went to the police station.  We produced his photo, we told the police that he disappeared and we were looking for some help.  They said we must go to the mortuary of number 4 because there are people who have been killed.\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MOGANO\nWe went to that mortuary but he was not there.  We went to John Vorster Square but he was not there.  We came back home.  We were so confused because we didn't even have a clue but we left his photo at the police station.  We were confused.  After five years, on the 7th March 1990 Matepe, one of my children, he was killed by the white men.  We were in the house, it was during the night, it was on a Friday.  He left, he said he was going to school, he was going to study there.  He was a student in one of the schools in town.  He was in Braamfontein, he was doing standard 10.  When he left it was round about half past 8.  After a few minutes we heard gun fire three times.  His brother Lucas went out to see what was happening.  He said here is Matebe, he is shot.  We went out, my Matebe fell down.  We saw a van, a white man's van driving away.  We asked him what was happening, he said those people shot me. We took Matebe to the house, we were still wondering what to do.  He was still talking.  His brother went out and got a car.  He asked for some help and he told the man that Matebe is shot by the boers.  They took Matebe to the clinic with the car.  When they arrived at the clinic Matebe died on arrival. They came back, they told me that when we arrived at the clinic Matebe was certified dead.  I lost strength, my brother Molepo and Lucas they made funeral arrangements.  I was very sick and weak, I couldn't go to the mortuary, I couldn't do anything because I was very weak at the time.  On a Saturday morning we got the canisters, they took them to the police station, they were in my gate, they were right at the gate at home.  The police asked if we knew the people, we said no we don't know them.  We just saw this car that was driving away, we don't even know who were the people. There was no case\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MOGANO\nbecause we didn't know whom to accuse.  We made arrangements for the funeral.  The most painful thing he left a girl who was three months pregnant.  This girl brought the child to me, I was working for the Council and I used to take this child with me and I had to take the child to the creche, pre-school and now I am not working, I don't know how am I going to support this child.  This is the most painful thing in my life.  What is he going to eat because I am not working now.  I don't have money.",

In our case it is sad to hear that you lost both your sons during the difficult years in the history of our country.  We will be in touch with you with whatever information which we have got.
