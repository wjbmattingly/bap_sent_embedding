            "I would like you to explain your story before the Commission.  On the 28th February 1992, it was early in the morning, nine o'clock.  When we woke up we saw a blue Cressida, there were three people inside the car.  We know one of the occupants of the car because he was staying opposite to our house.  I also know his name.  He was the enemy of the deceased.  I was busy preparing tea inside the house, the deceased came into the house and told me that they were going to town at the ANC offices, Khotso House.  He used to visit that place.  I suspected because I saw his enemy in the car, I didn't ask him much because even if they were enemies they used to talk to each other.  That is how he left our place.  It was about past nine in the\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 MAYISA\nmorning.  They took him the car, the Cressida.  That is how he disappeared.  5 strokes, 8, 10 until early in the morning we were still waiting for him.  The next morning when we woke up, I used to sleep with him and the others used to sleep in the front side of the house.  When I went to ask the others whether he arrived they said no, he didn't come back home.  We started going around asking the comrades whether they had seen him and they said they haven't seen him.  It was Saturday and on Sunday we tried to look for him.  On Monday in the morning we got a call from the ANC offices.  The person who called was Comrade Dipu. He said he got a phone call from Pretoria, Garankua that three people have been killed and he said because we heard that  you are also looking for someone who disappeared on Friday you had better go and check if it is not one of the three people who were killed.  We waited for this man and he came and he accompanied us to Garankua.  We went to the mortuary.  We met the criminal investigating officers.  We told them that one of our relatives had disappeared and we were just coming to check if he is not among the three.  They asked us if we had our ID's and we responded by saying yes we do have the ID's.  They looked at each other when they saw his picture and then it became clear to me that he is among the three.  They told us that they were still busy with the bodies, then we had to wait outside.  After some few minutes they called us.  We entered the room, they pulled them out and we discovered that the deceased, we identified them as one of my niece.  They have already been operated on, the CID told us that we have to give a statement and we refused to give a statement.  They tried to ask us to give the statement, we didn't give the statement, we just went back\nALEXANDRA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 MAYISA\nhome and we collected the hearse to come back the next day to collect him.  The following day we went there with the hearse.  We signed some papers for his release and the death certificate.  It was Temba.  The place was called Temba.  We pulled out the stretcher, we put him on the stretcher, we went on to look for a death certificate.  We asked at the police station where we can get a death certificate and they directed us to the place.  Before leaving the place we asked them to show us where the incident took place where they were killed.  They just directed us that it was under a bridge.  We insisted that they accompany us because we know customarily that if someone died in a particular place we have to go to where the person had been killed and also customarily or traditionally explain to the deceased's body that we are coming here to pick you up and take you back home.  They refused to take us to the place where they were killed and they said don't blame us, this person was given to us and we asked them who gave you the body, they said the police from Gauteng gave us this body.  And we asked them does it mean that you can't show us exactly where he fell and died.  They said no, they asked us where we come from, we said we are from Alexandra and one of them was surprised and we asked one of them to take us to the station commander, they said the station commander wasn't around at the moment and we could see that they were not going to help us because we were refusing to go and show us where they were killed.  We just continued to the offices to get a death certificate.  We reported the matter and we came back.",

As I think we have said in so many cases before the real pain, apart from the real pain of someone dying is the pain of not knowing why they died or how they died or who was responsible and that is something that we as a Commission are trying to do.  As I have said, if there is anything more that you remember please don't hesitate to come forward and let us know because we will investigate this and we will try and come back to you.  We understand your pain and we are very grateful to you for sharing your pain with all of us here.  We feel part of the community, we feel that it is very important, as you have shown, very important to come forward and to tell these stories, however painful they are.  So thank you very much for coming, both of you.  Thank you.",
