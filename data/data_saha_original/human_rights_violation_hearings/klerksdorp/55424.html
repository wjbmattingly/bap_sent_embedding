<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I am selling fruits and vegetables and chicken pieces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Before you were running this shop, what were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I was working at West Deep mine and worked on a contract and then we were retrenched and I went back home and I opened this small business.</p>

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> She is not working, she is a sickly person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Are your children at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, they are schooling.  My father passed away, I think it is two years back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> When you talk of your father, are you referring to your brothers and sisters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> No, I am referring to my father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Now are you telling us that you are responsible for the whole family now?  Are you not married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I am married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How many children do you have?</p>

<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Can you please carry on and tell us about the assault on you by the AWB people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> On the 10th of May 1991 I was from the place of work, heading for my home.  I had a car that time. I parked my car close to a house and I went to see my friends. I came back very late from my friends. I didn't want to wake up my family because I knew my father would be angry with me. I decided to sleep in the car.  I said well, very early in the morning I will wake up and prepare myself for the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>3 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>At about four o'clock, as I was sleeping, I was nearly dreaming and I heard people speaking outside.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a> These people were speaking Afrikaans. As I was listening I could hear that these people were still standing where they were, and I thought maybe they were working at Ventersdorp High School. As I was listening to them, I heard Eugene Terre'blanche's voice.  He was giving them a command, and as to what should they do when they attack people.  After giving them those orders and commands, they came and I was just lying in the car, with eyes open, because I wanted to see what was going to happen.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> They jumped into the yard and as I was listening they started attacking the house. I was in the car.  I couldn't then get out of the car.  After they attacked the house, they came out and they stood next to the car.  They smashed the back window.  The back window of the car and they came to the windscreen.  Because it was too hard, they hit it with a knobkierie twice and they were speaking and I could hear who they were.  Because the other one said Piet, this thing is too hard to crack, and Piet was giving him an answer and he said Koos, can you please stab the tyres.  As I was looking, Koos stabbed the - he punctured the tyres. I was so scared, I didn't know what was coming next.  I thought they would turn the car and burn it.  They just laughed and they jumped over the fence and they went into the veld shouting "AWB, AWB". </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a> I got out of the car as soon as they were gone and I got into the house.  Everything was not in an ordinary order, and I wanted to see members of my family.  I couldn't see them, because they were under the furniture that was lying all over.  I saw drops of blood and I followed these</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>4 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>drops of blood until I was in the street. I saw my mother lying and her head was injured, her whole body was also injured.  I picked her up.  I took her back into the house. My hands were full of her blood. </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> The police came at about six o'clock.  On their arrival I requested them to take them to the hospital.  They didn't help us.  They said we should come and report at about two o'clock so that they can take our statements.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a> The local ANC people came home and they called their Klerksdorp office and from Klerksdorp a car was brought to transport them to Klerksdorp Hospital.  We cleaned the house and we reorganised everything in the house and thereafter we went to the police station to give our statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a> But before we could give the statements, the police were teasing us, telling us that we are the squatters and they cannot just go out of their way to help the squatters.  I went to David Sigotho who was a CID at Klerksdorp. He welcome me and I gave him my statement.  After those few days, it was on a Monday, I heard that the AWB men have been arrested. On Tuesday they were released on R50,00 bail.   After two weeks I went back to the police station. I wanted to know what was going to happen to the damage we suffered.  The police said to me they do not have any help of any kind and what we should do, we should get ourselves private attorneys.  That was when we gave our statement to the Truth Commission, because we are lost.  We don't know what to do and where to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I am listening to you, Mr Phiri.  What time was it when this thing happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> It was about four o'clock Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What time did you leave your friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>5 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> It was at about ten o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You are saying that you parked next to the house but in your statement you have written a shack.  Were you in a squatter area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, we were in a squatter camp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You and the whole family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Where did you stay before you moved to the squatter camp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We were renting a municipal house.  There was a place called Detening(?).  We were given 14 days to be out of the premises, because my father was retrenched and we had to look for an alternative place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Were you staying in that house because your father was working for that company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How many were you at home at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Five girls. I am the only boy, we were six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How many rooms were in the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Are you referring to a shack, Sir?  It was a four-roomed shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You got out of the car and you went into the house and people were lying under - the furniture was on top of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, the furniture fell on them, actually.  Because everything was so disorganised in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If you say the furniture fell on them, did you physically lift the furniture to lift them loose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, because after picking up my mother outside I went into the house and I helped those who were in trouble.  My father was already injured, and his leg was</p>

<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>6 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>crippled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You say the people who were speaking spoke in Afrikaans and you could identify that it was Terre'Blanche.  Were you used to his voice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, I know him, I was born in Ventersdorp, I know his voice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If you say you know his voice, have you been to his meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> No, I have never been to their meetings where he addresses his people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> But now tell me, how did it come about that you knew his voice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> During holidays I was working temporarily at a filling station at Ventersdorp and he used to frequent that garage to fill his car with petrol.   We would talk, we would chat as I was on duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Were they attacking only your shack or were they attacking all the shacks in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> They were supposed to attack all the shacks marked with, because as they were standing next to the yard, he was telling them hit only shacks marked with an X.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What was this X?  What does this X symbolise actually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I do not know, but I think the X was an indication of an attack, because after talking about these Xs, we were attacked, but people with ordinary numbers were not attacked at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Those who were not attacked, what kind of people were they?  Were they not staying in shacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> They were also staying in shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Did you go to the councillors to investigate</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>7 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>as to why were your shacks destroyed and others left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We only heard rumours that we have placed ourselves in that area, that is the reason for the attack.  Because they didn't want us to get into the township and the ANC forcibly moved us to the location and they gave us sites.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> If you say they didn't allow you to stay in the township, are you referring to the councillors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We used to call them blockmen.  They didn't want us to reside within the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I want to know, were they not elected by the community or did they elect themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> They were just thinking for themselves, they didn't want anything to do with the ANC, because the ANC gave us the right to stay in that township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> On the day of the court hearing, were you present when these AWB men were fined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I was the only person who went to court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What did you do on their arrival, or what did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I enquired from the police as to what steps should be taken and they said to me the AWB men said they did not hit the shacks.  There was a card belonging to Piet Skiet Rudolph who was found ten metres from where I stay.  That is to what they feared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You have come to the TRC because you say the people from the ANC cannot take this matter further, or is it because you did not go through in the court of law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We are here to seek assistance with lawyers.  We didn't go much to the ANC for investigations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> So you are here to request the TRC to get you</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>8 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>a lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> How many of you need a lawyer, how many families?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I can't remember the number, but the assaulted people came together and would like to get a lawyer who will represent all of us, not me alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You see, we do not work hand-in-hand with the courts of law.  Maybe you should tell us your needs besides the lawyer, as people who have been assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Are you referring to our request from the Truth Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I am trying to tell you that your request of a lawyer or an attorney is not within our policy.  When people go to court they do it on their own will as a private matter.  Now seeing that you didn't know beforehand that we don't work with such matters, is there a request you want to make to the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We request the Truth Commission to help us trace them.  They should come and confess what they did.  They should come and we will forgive them.  But what remains behind, I lost my parent, because of their actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I am listening to your story. In other words you are telling me that if we can get hold of these people, you would be prepared to speak to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I don't have any more questions, Mr Phiri.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Prof Meiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Mr Phiri, you just said that you lost your parent because of this.  Do you refer to your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I am referring to my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>9 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Can you tell us what happened to her afterwards?  Because you said that she was eventually taken to the hospital by the ANC who sent a car from Klerksdorp. But then, what happened, was she treated at the hospital and return home or did she die in hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> She went to the hospital for treatment.  She spent two weeks at the hospital in Klerksdorp.  She was a person who cooked for us at home, who did everything for us.  She is still alive, but she cannot work, because she is now crippled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you.  So you lost her in the sense that she is crippled, that she cannot work any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you.  There is another thing I wanted to ask.  You say that when the people entered your house they not only created havoc, but they took the music system and the television.  Was that eventually returned to you or did you lose that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> They have been gone forever, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you.  Then another thing I wanted to ask, is that you mentioned the names of Mr Eugene Terre'Blanche and Mr Piet Skiet Rudolph.  Are you very positive that they were there on the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I am certain they were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> At the end of your testimony you tell of the incident when the police caught the perpetrators and eventually they were bailed out for R50,00 each.  Were these two gentlemen among the people who were bailed out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Are you referring to Eugene Terre'Blanche, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, they were among the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>10 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Also Mr Rudolph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you.  And then a last question I would like to ask of you, is you say that Mr Terre'Blanche claimed that some of the people of the shacks broke into their houses.  Was that the reason they gave for the attack on the shacks, that the people from the shacks, that they broke into the houses of the local community or how do we understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> There is a place called Goedgevonden towards Rustenberg direction.  They were actually planning to attack the people at that area. We were just innocent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> They gave no reason why your community was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We were just attacked for nothing. There was no reason given for the attack.  What the police told us, was that we have put ourselves in that area, illegally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> I have no more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Thank you, Prof Meiring.  Mr Phiri, I just want to understand this clearly, I am sure everybody wants to understand it.  You were saying that it is a piece of land that was there, that was empty.  Some people were given permission to put their homes up, others were not given permission. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And the ones who were not given permission, their houses were marked with an X?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And then at four o'clock in the morning, in mid-winter, and it is cold, you are sleeping in the car, it is totally dark - or were there lights around?</p>

<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>11 S R PHIRI</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Yes, there were lights.  The car was parked behind the shack and when this light was on, I was lying and they couldn't see in the car, because in winter it is a bit misty, and they couldn't see clearly inside the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Thank you.  And the mentioning of Mr Terre'Blanche and Mr Rudolph, is it also a fact that you knew they were part of the people were charged afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> They were found guilty after they attacked us. I didn't quite understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> I am saying that did you recognise them from their voices or did you recognise them from the fact that they were charged afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> I heard Terre'Blanche as he was giving them instructions and Piet Skiet Rudolph was after they tried to break the windscreen, because it was too hard. They were conversing as to how to break it and ten metres from the yard, we found Piet Skiet Rudolph's card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Okay.  Was there anybody who was killed on that night, Mr Phiri?  There were many homes that were attacked, was there anybody who got killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Nobody was killed, we were just assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Now you say these people were found guilty. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> They said they were not guilty because they did not attack, they actually mentioned that their offices were broken into.  That is the story they told the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> But was there a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> We didn't meet with them in court, they went to court and I followed them. I wanted the police to give me information as to what was going to happen with our case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And in court, were they found guilty?</p>

<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PHIRI:</span> Not, because they were released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Okay. Thank you, Mr Phiri.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a> Mr Phiri, thank you very much for coming all the way from Ventersdorp today.
