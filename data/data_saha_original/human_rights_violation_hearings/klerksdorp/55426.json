            "I want to start firstly with three years before in 1986, at Mqwasi, we were detained innocently. We hadn't done anything. We were tortured.  That was the birth of my political consciousness.  I started to have courage to lead people to follow political events and the processes which were happening, especially the Namibian war and the struggle for independence in Namiba. I used to follow that.  That influenced me greatly.\n In 1987 I was with my friend Kotzville, we were doing Std 7 together.   We used to talk about politics and the route (indistinct) and compared ourselves as well (indistinct) more than the other.\n In 1988 we met with other people, who had the same interests as we had.  We went that way until 1989, December, with Sobile.  Then we said that the city councillors were failing in the giving of services to the community.  Then we wrote a letter to City Press, in January 1990.  After the letter was published, the schools reopened the following week.  (Speaker's mike not on) ....\n ... they won't stop the harassment against us.  Indeed, the harassment didn't stop.  We continued receiving messages that are under surveillance.  Then we resolved as friends and as people who were becoming conscious of the development in our beloved South Africa, that we need to form a mouthpiece of the youth in Tswelelang for the entire Wolmaransstad.  We used to hold our meetings during odd hours, one o'clock in the morning, where selected people in whom we had confidence, would attend and be briefed. \n We had Comrade Dijavu Xubasa who was attending school\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 M S SEAKGOA\nat Wits University by then, who used to come with information to us.  \n On the 27th of April when the then Tswelelang Youth Congress was launched, I happened to have been elected as president of the congress.  Then the intimidation, harassment started to accelerate or increase from the side of the police. It was apparent that all my movements were monitored and my schedules were made known to whoever happened to have followed my movements and activities.\n At the same time that we were organising this Tswelelang Youth Congress we were also fighting a fierce battle against the intransigence of the management council of Gatelepele High School was I was attending. I was also one of the student leaders.  At one point when the students had very serious grievances, we held a meeting where a delegation of eight people was elected to meet the principal on the following day.\n I also need to make mention of the fact that the then principal Mrs Sotsaka had on several occasions refused to meet the delegations of the students or to answer whatever memoranda or ultimatums we sent to her.  She had then decided to meet us the following day.\n The following day we went to school, the eight of us, Comrade Koge, Comrade (indistinct), Comrade Pequalang, Magtire and the others whom I have forgotten.\n On our arrival the principal was busy teaching the matriculants at the library and we were waiting anxiously to meet with her.  The students resolved that they are going to take her by force from the library.  They went to the trees and picked stick where they are going to hit the principal and the matriculants with.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 M S SEAKGOA\n As leaders of the students we went there and we talked to them and ultimately the principal went out. We went to the principal's office.  On our arrival we found the police inside the principal's office.  The station commander then was a certain Mr De Villiers who was part of the meeting.  We deliberated for a long time and in the middle of our discussions Mr De Villiers, he was a lieutenant by then, just stood up and said gentlemen, you are under arrest. The principal stood and laughed.  We just stared at her and followed the police to their vans.  They shot two tear-gas canisters into the van and closed the doors so that we could suffocate.  \n We were taken to the police station where we were interrogated by a certain Detective-Sgt Van den Bergh.  We were arrested at exactly 25 minutes past ten in the morning, and we waited until three o'clock, around three o'clock - I am not exact there - where we were transferred to Hartebeesfontein - I don't know as to whether it is a police station or an army concentration camp or a prison.  The maximum security that was exercised there was something like a Nazi concentration camp.",

            "We were being watched around the clock.  At one point when it was during the days when the AWB raided the camps and stole arms from the Army bases. At one point in the middle of the night we were woken by flashlights in the cells, and when you wake up you find a big bearded guy with khaki-clad and AWB badges on the shoulders. Photographs of us were taken there. We couldn't identify those people who were intimidating us, we were afraid of our death.\n Young as we were we vowed that even if we die, our \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 M S SEAKGOA\nstruggle will still or our deaths will not be in vain, and our deaths will accelerate the liberation of many in South Africa.\n I also need to make mention of a certain Det-Sgt Callingan.  At that time when we were detained, I was unfortunate to have suffered from gonorrhoea which is a sexually transmitted disease.  For two weeks in detention I was refused medical treatment.  Even visits from my family members.  I pleaded with the then station commander, Sgt Potgieter of Hartebeesfontein, but to no avail.  Until such time that a certain lawyer from the Lawyers for Human Rights, Mr Atimi Ichbal Motala paid us a visit.  We complained to him.  At least I was sent to a certain Dr Meyer who had his surgery at Hartebeesfontein.  \n I never received any injection or anything, I was given tablets and had to go to my cell. I returned there and unfortunately the disease that I was suffering from, was being attended to some degree. I was recovering.\n This Det-Sgt Calligan came to me and offered me a sum of R200,00 so that I could write down the names of all my leaders.  He bought me a packet of cigarettes and biltong and he gave me 24 hours to write two pages of all the leaders that I know, who had given me instructions as to what to do, what to organise and what not.\n He came the following day and he found a blank page.  He found his packet of cigarettes and his biltong.  He told me why did you not eat it - he asked me why did I not eat that biltong and I bluntly told him that I suspect maybe that it has been poisoned and being in prison is an advantage in stopping smoking.  \n He gave me the pen and I started writing the names: \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 M S SEAKGOA\nNelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Joe Slovo ... (Laughter).  All the people that I know are famous.  Under the name of Joe Slovo, I underlined that, and that was the great mistake that I did.  I was made to squat on the floor and kicked on my private parts by Sgt Calligan.  \n Thereafter I was told to report the following morning to the charge office so that I can supply him with a fresh list of all the names of the leaders that I knew.  Again, I gave him the very same names of my national leaders, the leaders of the democratic revolution.  Again, I was viciously tortured.  My pleas went on deaf ears.  Family visits were not permitted.  Even our attorney visited us only once.  We couldn't buy ourselves food. We were given rations that were of poor nutritious value. To this point I still suffer from some of the repercussions of the treatment that I received.\n At one point a certain Mr Tsitse, whose rank I don't know, he was also in the security branch, hit me repeatedly with my head on the wall.  I fainted and I woke up in a pool of blood. Until today I have a serious problem of nervous tension. I was hospitalised about three times in the past three years. I am saying all the expenses that I have incurred because of the gross human violations that I encountered, need to be looked into and my future medications or whatever implications that I may be involved in, because of what I went through for the justified struggle against a minority regime, be looked seriously into by government.",

I am going to add by saying that there were people who were made known to us by the very system that we are working for. For instance, when in 1990, I should think it was in November, when we were going to write - I was going to write a History examination by then.   There was a certain council employee who was ordered to go and cut the water supply to Tswelelang because there was a rent boycott.    As the youth of Tswelelang and as the cutting edge of our liberation struggle, we resolved to go, to confront him and take the key from him and go and open the water supply.  It was unfortunate that an hour before I went for the History exam, the very same council employee drew a weapon and shot a (indistinct) comrade, by the surname of Lanks, at point blank.
