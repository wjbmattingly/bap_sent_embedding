Can we\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n6 N W MANGWELE\nplease settle down?\n Mrs Mangwele, you know about three or four weeks ago I sat as part of the panel listening to what happened in Boipatong, which is in the Vaal.   There people were not as fortunate, many people died on that night, when in that situation, it was a different group of people.  They happened to be Black in this situation, although it is not clear, it seems like most people have said, the people happen to have been White.  But what seems to have been common, is that these people were not concerned - I mean here you are. You ae not 68 years old.  At that time you were 63 years old.  This happened about five years ago.  But these people were not concerned whether they were attacking children, young people, elderly people. The question has to be asked: what manner of humankind is this, that go into other people's homes, attack them, sometimes kill people, sometimes cripple people, as has been mentioned here.  In your case also, your biggest concern, is the damage that was done to your property.  One can just hope and pray that these sort of events never take place again in our lifetime, and certainly in our country, and that you can find peace in this new South Africa that we have.\n I thank you for coming.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
