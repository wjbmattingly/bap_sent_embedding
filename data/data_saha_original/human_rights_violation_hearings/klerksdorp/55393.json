            "At that time there was unrest in the location. When the comrades went out to look for support at the various houses.  At the time that they were looking for support at the houses, they came to my house.  They said they are asking for support.  Then she agreed to go with them, because the main issue at that time, was that they intended to ban the Rev Ngwani's shop, who was regarded as an informer.  They did that.  What I remember well, when they arrived at my home it was nine o'clock in the evening.  They came to support to us as usual, then she went with him.  When they arrived at that shop, before they burnt the shop, the police came and shot with the tear-gas as usual.  Then everybody ran his or her own direction. Some of them were hiding at different places. They were hiding at the principal's house, because there were many trees outside and they were sitting under those trees, when others were going to shoot there.\n Those who were going to burn the house, they ran and the road which she took, that's where she was injured. It was not her alone, and even some she was with, were injured. She was shot at the back of the head and part of her brain fell there.  After she was shot, they beat her and her body changed colour. Her one hand was broken.  They took her to hospital.  They took them to hospital.  The reason was that when they came back from the hospital they will take them to the police cells.\n We slept there, not knowing what happened, whether she is safe or not. On the following day, very early in the morning my uncle came and asked my father if he knows her.  He said yes, I know her, because I have been looking for her\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 P L DITHEJANE\nthe whole night in the location, but I didn't find her.  Then he told him that that person is in hospital and the way he was told,  she died at six o'clock at the hospital.  \n My father contacted the hospital to find out whether this was true.  He found out that that is true, my sister has died.  We also went to confirm her death and found out that it is true.\n After that these police were not bothering with her because before the funeral they came to ask my father to come and make a statement, because they say there is money, he was promised money.  We didn't know what that money was for.  They told him to come and make the statement.  At the time he asked, he said should firstly prepare for the funeral, then he will attend to everything thereafter.  He was saying to himself why would they say he must come and make a statement, knowing that he is doing that.\n The funeral was arranged and it passed.  Every day during the mass actions the police used to come and they used to shoot with the tear-gas and people used to run away.  But they were shooting only tear-gas, they were not shooting guns to kill.  \n On the day of the funeral they were trying to cause confusion.  But the comrades who were there, and other people there at the time, they didn't pay attention, because they were trying to do their own thing. The funeral went well. After the funeral they took my father to come and make the statement.  He made the statement.  Since it was made, he was not called or even given that money which he was promised, which he didn't know why they wanted to give him the money.  They did not even give him the money and we don't know what has happened to the case.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 P L DITHEJANE",
