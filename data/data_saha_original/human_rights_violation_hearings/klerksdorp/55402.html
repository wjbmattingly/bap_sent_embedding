<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REBECCA MAPOGO:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  Now Mrs Mapogo, Dr Fazel Randera will guide you through your testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Rebecca, good afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Good afternoon, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Rebecca, you have come to tell us about Stephen Loving Kauba.  He was killed by what - when he was shot from a military vehicle on the 7th of March 1990.  You are coming from Ventersdorp, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>2 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Rebecca, before we get into you telling your story, perhaps you can just tell us where are Stephen's mother and father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> They passed away a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> So Steven was staying with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Can you please tell us something about Steven, how old was he, was he going to school, was he a member of a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> When Steven died, the witnesses gave Steven's years as 54 years and he was still schooling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Sorry, was he born in 1954?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> He was 54 years, he was born in 1937.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> But you said he was still going to school.  Now was he your uncle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Thank you, that makes it a bit clearer.  What was Steven doing in 1990 when this happened to him? Was he working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> He was from work after he knocked off.  Then he passed at my home, he went to his younger brother.  Then he got the marshalls who were singing but they were not fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> What was his work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> He was working as a gardener at the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And was he married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Did he have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> No, he had no children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Sorry, can you go on and tell us what happened</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>3 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> In 1990, on the 7th of March it was at about past eleven, he was from work.   He found these children where they were playing, but there was no fighting.  He was from his mother's home to his younger brother's home.  When he passed in the direction of our home, he was standing and other children were there.  At home they were toyi-toying.  Then the Hippo passed, the first one passed.  Then it turned at the circle.  Then it returned to Makweti.  The second police van passed again.  Then one policeman appeared who was hefty.  He showed my uncle a gun and then he shot him with bullets.  The first bullet was on the mouth, the second one on the heart, the third one on the waist.  Then he died dinstantly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> At the time the hearse was called, together with an ambulance. When the two cars arrived, one called Joubert asked somebody and said who shot. The other said the person who shot is Steven.  Then he said who is Steven?  Then he said Steven who was working with you at the hospital.  Then he said who shot?  Then he said the second Hippo is where the bullets were coming from.  Then he called to stop them. Then they came.  Then he asked them, why did you shoot this man?  Then he said it was a mistake, I was not sure that I will be able to shoot him.  Then he said look, what have you done, is you have shot an innocent person.  Then they took out the stretcher and put him in an ambulance.  Then they took him to the hospital.  From the hospital they didn't even stay one day, then he was taken to the mortuary.  They took him to Diepkloof mortuary.  Then he stayed there for two weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a> Then he was saying he was carrying two petrol bombs.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>4 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>Then they said this person is not a fighting person.  Then he doesn't like things.  Then they were thinking that he has petrol bombs.  Then we left with my aunt to look for his papers. </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a> On the third week they came from Diepkloof mortuary, then they wanted us to identify the corpse. Then we were able to identify the corpse.  Then they gave us his clothes.  Then we came back home. </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a> On the 21st of March we buried our uncle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a> After that, on the 8th of March we were taken to Johannesburg ANC headquarters, where we filled in the forms, but we do not understand what was happening, because I did not understand.  Then we returned home.  We left those forms there.  Then we went back home. </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a> After that the person who was coming to us was Mr Morris, who used to come to tell us the process and the procedure of the whole thing.   They haven't come through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Rebecca, thank you very much.  You were with your uncle at the time when he was shot. You were standing next to him with - I think you mentioned some other people's names.  There were Teddy and Archie, all standing together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> How far was this police vehicle from you when this man shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> It was about a distance from where I am standing, perhaps maybe to these booths where these people are in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And you say there was no, people were not running around, they weren't throwing stones.  You and your uncle and your two friends, and other people were just toyi-toying, but you were just standing there. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>5 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes.  The people were just standing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Was there anybody else who was shot on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, people were shot, two people were shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Were they killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> On that afternoon three people died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Phiri Matupi and Steven Kauba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Now in your statement you also say that when Hannes Joubert, who was the ambulance driver, who worked at the same hospital and knew your uncle, came to the spot, he actually spoke to the people, to the person who shot your uncle. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, that's true. He was asking why did they shoot Steven.  They said it was a mistake.  They were saying they didn't know what they were doing.  Then he told them that now, see that this person has died.  And they said that they are very sorry of what they have done.  Then he said it doesn't help because he has died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> But initially you said in your statement they were laughing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, they were laughing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> They were laughing during the time that they were shooting people or afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> After they had shot they were laughing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And then when Hannes Joubert came they actually apologised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, Sir. Then Hannes Joubert called them.  Then he talked with them.  Then Hannes Joubert said you have shot a person who is innocent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Do you know the names of these - were they policemen or were they Army people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>6 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> They were private policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Private policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> They didn't have any uniform on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> They were having a uniform, but they didn't have their - they didn't have their epaulettes.  They didn't identify themselves, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Would you be able to recognise them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> I just know that he is a hefty person, but who is very short.  He was not staying at Ventersdorp, I don't know where he comes from.  The person who should know them is Palmer, who has called them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> This is the former station commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Mr Palmer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> But he has been transferred somewhere else, you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Now you went and you filled in some forms at Shell House in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, that's true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> And this Mr Morris who came afterwards to see you, was he a lawyer from the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, he is the person who accompanied us to the Shell House in Johannesburg. He was helping us to fill in the forms.  He was a leader of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Is he from Johannesburg or from Ventersdorp or where is he from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> This Morris, he is staying at Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> He stays in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>7 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Now once that was done, you know where the bullets went in. Was that from the post-mortem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, it was from the post-mortem report.  My elder uncle is the one who came with the information, and those papers, we lost them when we were on our way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> After that, was there an inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> There was nothing extra, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Did you report it to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> We did report it to the police station but they didn't help in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> So Mr Morris - did you got and ask Mr Morris again after that what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, we went to ask him.  Then he said we should not be impatient, we are so many, so we should not be impatient, they will give us a report later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> So you are saying that after the post-mortem you heard nothing else, besides filling in some forms with Mr Morris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> We didn't hear anything thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Rebecca, I don't have any further questions, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Rebecca, I just have one question.  Your uncle, he lived with your family.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, that's true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was your family dependent upon him, his income, did he contribute to the family's finances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Can you repeat the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he bring money to the family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> Yes, he is the one who was taking care of the family.  He was buying us everything. He was clothing us,</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>8 R MAPOGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>buying us food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when he died, what happened to the family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MAPOGO:</span> We were just suffering, not having somebody to look after us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you so much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">DR RADERA:</span> Rebecca, and your auntie, you know sometimes we are lost for words when we hear the stories that people tell us. I must say I am lost for words right now, because here was a man who was doing his work, who had his job, who was  on his way home, supporting his family, and people shoot at him.  Then they actually say that they were not sure whether they would be able to shoot at a person. There are so many of these stories of what happened in our country, and even in these last few days, as we have heard, the stories from different townships in this, what I call the circle, the old Western Transvaal area, undoubtedly there were young people, there were elderly people like your uncle, who were either tortured or in your uncle's case, killed.  We need to find some answers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a> In many ways, I think one of my fellow Commissioners, Ms Sooka, said yesterday that the very people who are meant to be the custodians of our safety, appear to be implicated in what was going on.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a> Her appeal and my appeal, of course today, is that we need to listen from their side, so that this truth that we talk about, can be laid open and we can understand what happened from both sides. </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a> I thank you very much for coming and you will be hearing from us again.  Thank you very much.</p>
