They were together with Margaret and they signed at Sebong. Jan Drom was there.  We didn't see him thereafter, since the last day at the hospital.  When I went back home they were sitting crying and I asked them as to what was happening.  They said the child has been taken to Sebong Hospital by Jan Drom and \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 M P MATHIBA\nMargaret was in their company.    We didn't hear anything thereafter and we didn't know his whereabouts since that day.  We hoped that Jan Drom will tell us the whole truth, because he was the person in charge of the farm.  Even today we are still shocked.  We do not know whether the child is still alive, whether the child is dead.  Nobody knows.  When I asked them they would say he is in one of the hospitals.  They do not tell us which hospital.  We remained in that belief that he is alive, he is in one of the hospitals, but we do not know which one.  We are here to request the Commission to force this rich man Jan Drom to tell us what happened to our child, because he was last seen with him when he took him to the hospital in Margaret's company.  That is where I will end.  \n I have the identity document, it was picked up by David Matiba.  This identity document was found in a rubbish bin, it was supposed to be burnt to ashes.

She is here now. She is in fact sitting right next to you.  So it appears to make much more sense for us to hear directly from her what happened, when last she saw Johannes so that we have a clear picture and so that we know how to go ahead with this matter.

I was already at home and my mother came in from the farm and she said to me listen here, Johannes is injured, and during that time he was already taken by Jan Drom. He took him to Tigane at the doctor and I ran after them to wait for me.  When I told him to wait, to stop the car so that I could go with them, he did stop the car.  When I looked at this child in the van, he was so injured and he had a bit of soil on his face. He\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 M P MATHIBA\nas still talking, but his two legs were not working at all, they were motionless.  We arrived at Tigane and the doctor came to the van to look at the child.  He said to Jan Drom take him to the hospital.  We immediately drove off to the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital he was put on a stretcher. I was following them.  Jan Drom was together with us.  They took his particulars and I took his shoes off and we went to see the bed where he was going to lie.  The two of us signed. Because I didn't know how to sign, I just wrote my name.  Jan Drom signed.  We came back then.\n I didn't even take two days to go and visit him.  The next day I went back to the hospital to pay him a visit. On my arrival it came to my understanding that he was not yet attended to.  Then I stayed three days at home.  Another child on the farm also got ill. Jan Drom himself took the child to the hospital. When he was taking this child to the hospital I said I am driving with you.  On my arrival in the hospital I said to them listen here, I am not here to accompany them, I want to see Johannes.  That is where I realised that something was wrong.  Because we went to see Johannes and he was already attended, because he had something on his neck.  We stood by his bedside and the nurses didn't allow me to look at his feet. \n After a week I went back to the hospital to visit him. I was told that he was not in the hospital. I wanted them to give me an answer as to where he was.  They said no, he had been sent, he has been transferred to Baraghwanath. I asked them when, because I was here; why did you transfer him to Baraghwanath without informing the family. They didn't have an answer. I said to them call the hospital, enquire from the hospital about his health.  When they were supposed to \nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 M P MATHIBA\ngive Baraghwanath a call they didn't.  I went back home. Their grandfather died in that week.  The child was still in hospital, according to the information that we were given.  Our grandfather passed away on another farm, he was staying there.  We went to mourn.  As we were mourning a messenger came and said he was sent by Jan Drom to tell us that the child has passed away, and he was already buried.  The question that I asked, was the minister of religion was event sent at home.  When we moved from the grandfather's place, we went home. On our arrival the minister of religion was there to bring condolences from Jan Drom. I personally enquired from the minister, minister, you are here to give us condolences, who buried the child.",
