<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Mmolawa, good morning and welcome to you. Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Are you comfortable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Mmolawa, can you please introduce the young man who is accompanying you this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> That's my son, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Ezekiel Mmolawa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Okay. I welcome Ezekiel too.  Mrs Mmolawa, will you please stand to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MERIAM MMOLAWA:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Mmolawa, Adv Denzil Potgieter is going to be helping you in telling your story and I hand over to him. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you, Dr Randera.  Good morning, Mrs Mmolawa.  Welcome again.  Can I just find out, we have a statement from yourself and it concerns the torture and detention of your son, Ezekiel who is with you today. But I don't have in my possession a statement from Ezekiel himself. Did he actually give a statement to the Commission or did he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>2 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> He didn't do that, it is me who did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And insofar as you are concerned, you have really only heard what happened to him, you only heard about the torture. Not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> That has in fact occurred to me when I read through your statement, and I was thinking that Ezekiel is obviously the best person to tell us what happened.  It depends on what the Chairperson's view is, but it might be a similar case to the earlier one where we might have to take the testimony of Ezekiel, but before we deal with that, will he be able, if the Chairperson were to allow that, would he be able to give us testimony today? Is he in a position to tell us today, is there anything wrong with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> He will be able to do that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Perhaps just a minute, perhaps we must just hear what the Chairperson's view is on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that as Ezekiel is here today, it would be in a sense an incomplete story if whilst we are having him her, we are not able to hear from him directly. What I will however hsay is that that is subject to our statement-takers taking his statement immediately he gives his testimony.  So you can swear him in, Faizel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can you hear me, Ezekiel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can you please stand to take the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">EZEKIEL MMOLAWA:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you, Ezekiel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you once again, Dr Randera, Chairperson.  Mrs Mmolawa, I think let's start with you.  We will take your evidence first and then Ezekiel can just fill KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>3 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>in the picture as to what exactly happened.  Would you like to tell us about his arrest and when they took him away from home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> It was in 1993, in June, it was on a Tuesday. White people came.  They came to my home.  They surrounded the whole house, at the front and at the back.  They were kicking the doors and the windows. They were torching us with their torches at night whilst we were asleep. They told me to open.  When they asked me to open they said they are police people.  When I opened, White people entered the house with balaclavas.  They entered roughly and they light us up with torches.  Then they said we want your son.  When I was still looking the Black one came again.  That Black one, I halt him, he was a CID.  Then I said Ezekiel is in the bedroom.  Then they said he must put on his clothes quickly, because they want him. I asked them where they are taking him to.  Then they told me that they are going to hit him.  Then I was frightened and then I closed the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a> The following day, it was in the morning, at about three o'clock, I went to investigate where he is.  Then they said I should go to the police station, because they were having balaclavas I couldn't identify them.  We went to the police station.  At the police station they said my child is not there.  Whilst I was preparing myself to come back they said they came back from Orkney, they come from the scrapyards.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a> Then when I asked my son what he was doing there.  He told me that they were beating him in the dark on the ear with the clips and fists.  Then he had an ear problem. Then I took him to the doctor.  They only kept him in the hospital for that day.  They wanted bail of R100,00.  I paid KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>4 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>that R100,00 bail.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> Thereafter the case ran for three days, but there were no court proceedings, they were just postponing the case.  The court procedure completed in 1995, December.  That's when the case ended.  During that time I was taken him to various doctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Mrs Mmolawa, you live in Lebaleng, is it correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> In June of 1993 what was the situation in the township like?  In fact, to assist you, in your statement you refer to the shooting of Joe Olifant, it is a case that we will hear later on in the day. What was the situation like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> The police were coming during the night.  They were making it possible to make it safe for the principal. Then the following day it was that my son was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> You seem to have referred to this in your statement, that there was a situation of unrest in the township at this time, in June 1993. It was shortly after the killing of Joel Olifant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> That is immediately after the death of Olifant. The day after Joe Olifant's funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> The court case that your son, Ezekiel, was involved in, subsequently, what was that about?  Was it about the burning of the school or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> They alleged that they were stoning the school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> What happened to that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> The case just ended somewhere, we don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> How old was Ezekiel in 1993 when</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>5 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Can you repeat your question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> How old was Ezekiel in 1993 when this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> He was 20 years old, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you, Mrs Mmolawa. I am going to ask Ezekiel questions first and it might be that my colleagues would want to ask you some questions afterwards.  But I am now going to ask for the microphone to be moved to Ezekiel and we will listen to his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a> Ezekiel, morning, welcome.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Good.  Now from the information in our possession here, it appears as if you were arrested at home on the 1st of June in 1993. Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, it is true, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And do you know the police that came to arrest you?  In fact, your mother said that some of them were wearing balaclavas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I don't know them, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> There was also a, from your - from the testimony of your mother's it appears there was a Black policeman present as well, when you were arrested at home. Do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I know him, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> His name Sipetlo.  Steve Sipetlo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Was he a policeman where, at Makwassie, Makwassie police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> He is a CID at Klerksdorp, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Now would you like to tell us, Ezekiel, what KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>6 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>happened when the police came to your house there and they took you away?  Tell us exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> When the police came to arrest me at home, we were many who were arrested.   There was a house next-door, which is a double-storey house. I only heard the sounds of the vans. I thought maybe the Kombi is for the owner of tha house.  After that I heard many sounds.  When I looked outside I saw police vans and Kombis.  Thereafter I went to my mother. I said people are wearing balaclavas and after that they knocked at the door and they broke the windows. Thereafter my mother opened the door for them and then they said they wanted Ezekiel. They came to my bedroom and they found me there, I was asleep.  Then the CID whom I know, then said to me come, let's go.  He was together with other White CIDs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a> After that one boy came to the police station.  When I get into the Kombi ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a> We went to look for Sete, he wasn't at home.  Then we left for the police station.  They filled their car with petrol and they drove to the scrapyard.  They assaulted us in a very dark room.  They were hitting me on my ears, but I cannot identify who it was hitting me on the ears.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a> At about six o'clock in the morning they wanted us to write our statements.  They said that we should agree that we broke the principal's house. I said to them no, I was present in the township, but I was not present when the house was stoned.  They sent us back to Makwassie police station and they said R300,00 bail or three days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Were you then charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, I was charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> What did they say what charge was it, what</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>7 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>was it you were supposed to have done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> They said I was stoning the police station, but I must say I can't remember what the name was, but the police in the township pointed out people whom they alleged they have seen throwing stones, and one policeman from Makwassie pointed me out.  He was not present when a group of CIDs got into the house, he remained in the Kombi. I know him. He stays at Motseng, in Makwassie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And what happened to the charge against you, what happened to the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> We were given five years of hard labour outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Now when this happened in 1993, what were you doing, were you at school, were you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I am self-employed, I wasn't at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And we have heard that there was some unrest in the township at that time, that was just after the shooting incident involving Joel Olifant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> We stay in one street with the person who has been shot, in the same street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Were you politically involved, politically active?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, I was active.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> What sort of a structure, what organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> The ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Now can we just come to the incident where you were assaulted.  Did you say that you were taken to the scrapyard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, they took us to the scrapyard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Where is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> At Orkney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>8 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Do you know, was it the police that took you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> The CIDs, with balaclavas took us there. I know only one of them who was the Black man, but there were three other Blacks whom I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Was this Steve Sepetlo that you referred to earlier, was he also present in this group that took you to the scrapyard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> He was present when they took me to the scrapyard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And there you say that you were assaulted, you were beaten on your ears.  With what were you beaten on your ears?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> They were using their hands, they were slapping me on the ears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Were you assaulted in any other way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> No, they were just using their hands to slap me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> What was the consequence of that assault, what was the consequence of being beaten on your ears?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> My ear was badly injured, the ear-drum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And what is the condition of your ears at present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> It is not that fine yet, because I usually have pain in my ear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> What is your hearing like today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> At times that ear-drum just closes itself, I don't hear anything, but at times I do hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Have you instituted any claims against the police for the assault and the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>9 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Is there anything else that you wish to add to your evidence before I finish off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> No, Sir, there is nothing I want to say further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you very much.  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Dr Randera will ask you some questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Ezekiel, I just want to come back to that night, both you and your mother say that everybody wore balaclavas and that your mother recognised the voice of one person and you recognised the voice of that same person.  This person called Steve.  Now did these people actually identify themselves at any time, either at your house or in the scrapyard, in the room where you were tortured, as policemen or CID people or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> They didn't introduce themselves in any way. I only saw Steve because I know that he is a CID.  Then I thought that all of them are CIDs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did you see Steve or you recognised his voice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I saw him, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now I just want to also ask you about the court case.  You say that you were charged.  What was the charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> They say my charge is breaking the school quarters where the principal was staying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And you were sentenced to five years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How much of that time did you actually serve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Five years punishment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> It was a suspended sentence, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I was outside, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>10 M MMOLAWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> I want to come back to this incident about the principal and the school.  It seems like the youth or the comrades actually targeted schools at that time. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> The people who attacked the school are the students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> You were falsely accused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> Yes, I was falsely accused because I was not even there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Ezekiel, just two short questions for our records.  When did you leave school, at what standard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I left school in 1983 becaue I was sick. I was doing Std 4 at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> You say that you are self-employed.  What do you do for a living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I am doing electronic and welding, electrician.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Did you receive training for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ezekiel, I just want to ask you two questions.  When you were charged, were you charged by yourself or in a group with a whole number of other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I was in a group of other people, we were six all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you charged with public violence or were you charged with breaking and entering property?  Could you be more specific?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> It was public violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How much time did you actually spend in jail? Not your sentence, how long did you spend in jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> I only stayed three days.</p>

<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you had a suspended sentence, that if you did that again you would go to jail for five years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Thank you - Dr Randera wants to ask another question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Sorry, Ezekiel, who represented you in that court case, who was the lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MMOLAWA:</span> That's Schoeman, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ezekiel, and thank you, Mrs Mmolawa for coming today.  Thank you for sharing that story with us.  We know there was a time in our country when people were charged, youngsters, particularly were charged with public violence and thrown into jail.  And that a lot of things were done to them and many of them bear the scars of that today. In your case, Ezekiel, has a problem with his ear, which will probably be there for a very, very long time.  It is the legacy of the past that we have actually gone through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a> What is disquieting however, is that we rely on certain institutions to protect us, and the fact that were nameless and faceless people who came into your homes,  into your communities and who took police away, means that it is very, very difficult for us to understand why these things happened in that particular way.  But one of the jobs that we have to do, is to make sure that people are never able to act in that way again, that if they come to your home to take you away, they must have the proper documentation and they must have the proper authorisation to do these things.  Part of the job in our country is rebuilding all these structures.</p>

<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a> Your story shows that lots of things happened which even we don't really know about.  We will try to see what can be done about Ezekiel's ear, but thank you for sharing that with us.</p>
