<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I can hear you, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Are you well?</p>

<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Khiba, there is nothing to be anxious or frightened about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I don't think I will be frightened, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> I am glad to hear that.  Mrs Khiba, before I ask you to stand to take the oath, will you please introduce the lady who is with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> This is Neria Mahala.</p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you, Mrs Khiba, would you please sit down.  Mrs Khiba, you come from Kanana township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Kanana is just outside Orkney, which isn't very far from here.  It is a mining community.  You have come to</p>

<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>2 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>tell us about the disappearance of your son. This happened in March 1986.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a> Before you tell us about your son, can you please tell us something about yourself, how old are you, how many children do you have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I had ten children, five of them passed away and I have six daughters.   Four of them are married and two of them are crippled.  The other one can hardly walk and the other one is just a cripple, as I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How old are you, Mrs Khiba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> 78 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you.  Is your husband still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> He passed away a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And what was your work before you retired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I was a domestic worker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Khiba, please tell us in your own words what happened to your son, Sam Lethoba Khiba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> It was on the 4th of March 1986, in the afternoon at about seven o'clock he left the house and he didn't come back.  We only heard gun shots.  Police were all over the place.  There was gunfire the whole night.  The next morning I went to the police station to report his disappearance.  They didn't give me an answer. I searched for him all over, in the mortuaries, in the hospitals, until today I haven't seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a> A policeman came to me and he asked me where my son was. I said to him I do not know.  He said to me give me his identity document. I gave him the ID and he left.  After a few hours they came back, they were now two in number.  He asked me again: has he not arrived as yet.  I said no. </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did you not hear from the policeman again after KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>3 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> They never came back to me.  They left forever, until today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Khiba, tell us something about Sam Lethoba.  How old was he, was he working when this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> He was working at the municipal offices.  He was the last born and I had my hope on him. I thought at this ripe age he would work for me. Nobody is taking care of me. I am depending on the pension money I get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Was he married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, he was not married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did he have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> He didn't have any children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> How old was he when he disappeared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> He was 21 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now you say that night in Kanana was gunfire and you could hear it all night.  What was actually happening in the township that caused all these problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I do not know, Sir, what was happening. It was a riot and the police were shooting at people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Was your son involved with the youth congress or with the UDF or civic organisations in Kanana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, he only played soccer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> When he left the house, that evening, it was seven o'clock at night, where was he going to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I do not know, he just went out, he didn't say where he was going to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did he go by himself or did some friends come to meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, he didn't say anything to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Did he have many friends?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>4 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> He had friends, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And as part of your enquiries, did you find out from friends that had seen what had happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I asked them and they said they did not know where he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What do you think happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I think the people who were on te night duty on that same day, were De Kock and De Beer and De Kock took his identity document.  De Beer was a special branch member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> In fact, that was my next question to you.  The name of the people who came to your house, the policemen who took the ID document from you, was that Mr De Kock and Mr De Beer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, De Kock was shooting at night, he was on night duty and the second one is a special branch, and he is the one who took his identity document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can I ask how you know that Mr De Kock was shooting at night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> My daughter works at the police station and she knows the police who work duty, at night duty, because she is a police woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can I then ask you, what was the names of the policemen who came to your house and took the ID document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> It is De Beer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Was that ID document ever returned to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> It was never brought back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mrs Khiba, I do not have any other questions. I would like to hand you over back to the chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tom Manthata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Mrs Khiba, good morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> Good morning, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>5 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> You said your daughter was a police woman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> Yes, she is still a police woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> What assistance did she give the family with regard to the loss of your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I do not know.  She never said anything about the disappearance of her brother.  She was disturbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Now this shooting incident that took place the whole night, did it take place that only night or did it take place on many occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> It took place on many occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Among the people, who was the target actually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> Everybody that was passing was a target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Were there leaders in the township, leaders that we would say were responsible maybe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, the leaders were present, but they didn't know anything about the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Didn't they help to investigate the disappearance of some members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, they didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Aren't they taking any iniative at this present moment to trace the disappearance of the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, they haven't tried it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> Don't you think it is important to start an investigation, especially for the people who have been scared of asking for help?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I am here before the Truth Commission to request them to help me trace my son, even if he is dead, I would be glad to bury his remains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MANTHATA:</span> I thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Piet Meiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Mamma Khiba, I just want to ask a few</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>6 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>questions about your own life.  You told us that you are 78 years of age, that you had ten children, five of them are dead. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> You say that you have two crippled children who are dependent upon you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> May I ask how old are the two children who are dependent upon you, the two crippled children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I don't remember their names, please forgive me, because I am not feeling very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> It doesn't matter at all.  Are the two children able to work at all or do they do nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> They are not working.  The other one had a stroke and the other one cannot walk and he is mentally disturbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> I am very sorry to hear that. Are you living in your own house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> Yes, that is my house, I bought it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> And you live from your pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I depend on the pension, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Please forgive me for asking, how large is the pension, how much money do you get every month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> It is R420,00.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you very much.  Those are the questions I wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mrs Khiba, I note that you say that you are not feeling very well, so I will not keep you very much longer.  But perhaps, just to try and get a complete picture of what happened, the ID document that was taken by the police, was that returned to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>7 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> The identity document was never brought back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now did the police tell you what they wanted to do with the ID document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> They never gave me an explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the disappearance of your son ever put in the newspapers, was there any report about that in the newspaper?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then just a final question.  When did you realise, when did you realise that he was actually missing. Was it that same night or the following morning of a few days later or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> The same morning when we woke up, we realised that he was missing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if he disappeared, it must have been in Kanana, he didn't leave Kanana to your knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you start enquiring around and looking for him the very morning that you realised that he was missing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> We started investigating the same morning.  We went all over the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you couldn't get any idea of what happened or where he was or where he went to the previous evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> We didn't get any trace until today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When he left the house, he didn't take anything with him, he just left like somebody who was going somewhere quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KHIBA:</span> He left as if he was coming back, he didn't have anything with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Mrs Khiba, thank you for your testimony.  We hear quite a number of cases</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>8 M KHIBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>relating to disappearances.  It is the kind of case that presents a particular challenge to the Commission, because often it is very difficult to deal with a disappearance. Often it relates to an incident that happened some time back.  In your case your son has been missing for at least the past ten years.  That, of course, together with the scant information that one normally finds when we have to deal with cases of disappearance, puts a particular challenge to the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a> However, because of the fact that the proceedings of this Commission is publicized very widely, there is always a prospect of some information being forthcoming.  Simply as a result of the fact that the proceedings itself is heard by many people, and a lot of people take note of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a> We also understand the anguish that goes with a disappearance for the family. In your case, particularly, you didn't have a very easy life.  You are advanced in years.  So it must be very, very difficult for you even now, to deal with the uncertainty to know exactly what happened.  So we want to say to you that we do understand, and we feel with you.  We understand that anguish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a> We have noted what you have said, why you came here today, in an attempt to get assistance, in an attempt to try and find out what happened to your son. We have noted that. We will see what could be done about the matter, but as I have said earlier, it is normally a very difficult kind of case to deal with, because of the fact that there is normally very little information to go on.  But thank you once again for coming and good luck forward.  Thank you.</p>
