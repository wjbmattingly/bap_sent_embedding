Again, we are going to that, as other people have pointed out already, the year 1986 was a particularly terrible year for our history. I am sure when our history books are rewritten, that year will stand out.  I don't know whether people have seen the graph that is on the board outside.  But that graph shows from year to year how many human rights violations took place.  As early as - and our work as we are at the present time, 1986 already stands out.

This crowd was standing at a taxi rank.  They shot three times.  Because of the tear-gas people started taking different directions.  \n There was another policeman who was putting a helmet on his head and he wanted to shoot at us.

There were legal attorneys called para-legal Whites.  I went to see them for help. There was a certain Mrs M M Sewo, who advised me about the procedure of laying charges.  She said to me it is very important for you to lay charges, because you have been to the doctor. \n I went back to the doctor, I told him doctor, I want to lay charges, what should I do then.  He said to me I should go to the police station to get a G88 form and fill it in and they will give me the case number.  I went to the police station for that form.  A White lady at the police station gave me that form and I went back to the doctor.  It wasn't on the same day.  I had financial problems to go to all these places.  \n On a different day I went to Dr Jaroska and he was not in the office and nobody was present to help me fill in the form.  One doctor said to me you want to lay charges, where are you injured.  I showed him, and he said go to a district surgeon, go to the hospital, you will find one there. I took this form of mine and I went to the district surgeon and he didn't do anything.  He just looked at me. He wrote in this form. When I looked at this form I couldn't read his handwriting.  Even his name was not clearly written.  \n I went back with this form. I took it to Mrs Sewo. I said Mrs Sewo, here is the form.  She said to me that's fine, go back to the police station then, lay charges.  I went straight to the police station to lay charges.    It was on a Friday and on the 3rd of the 5th month.  The policeman called Otto Mazibuko was on duty and I told him.  I even took the X-ray reports and everything.  I took them with to the police station and I told them I was shot by the KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n9 S P MOTHUSI\npolice in 1986, I am here to lay charges today.  this Otto Mazibuko said to me this is a difficult matter to handle, we cannot accept this.  He said you should come and meet the adjudant, tell him that you want to lay charges.  It was a Friday, and on Saturday I didn't go that day. I didn't know that they were working on Saturday.  The weekend went by.   On Monday I went to see this adjudant Locke and he was present.  I showed him the forms and I showed him the X-rays. I told him that I was shot by the police in 1986, and I want to open a case with this matter. He didn't want to have a look at the forms. He called one of the policemen, by the name of Sgt Nkulo Njecke. He said he should take my statement and he should help me.  I left with this Sgt Nkulo Njecke and he took my statement.  He gave me a case number.  He said my case number was MR4060596.  The Tuesday went by.  On Wednesday the detectives came to my home.  They were Sgt Merry and another detective, I do not know the name.  They had this docket with them and they were questioning me.  They said to me why didn't you die if you were shot in the head. I said to them sergeant, I was shot, listen at what the doctor is saying, I have proof, I have the X-ray reports and the sergeant said no, I don't want to see them. The sergeant asked me as to where the doctor was situated. I said the doctor was at Klerksdorp Hospital.   And that was it.  \n Until today Mrs Sewo advised me about the Commission.  she said to me Sello, the Commission is coming to our area, we will have to submit our statement and then the Commission will give you a date to appear.  I went to her and she took my statement. I am really sorry because I didn't bring the X-ray forms with me.  But the police have the form in their\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n10 S P MOTHUSI\ndockets. If I go to the police station, Sgt Merry is not at the office. The documents, everything regarding my health is in that document.  That was the last day of my initiative.",

We have noted what you have said about your medical condition. The fact that you have a limited working capacity, it seems, diminished working capacity at this stage.  We have noted what you have said about laying a charge with the police and not having heard anything further about that.
