They were kicking the doors and the windows. They were torching us with their torches at night whilst we were asleep. They told me to open.  When they asked me to open they said they are police people.  When I opened, White people entered the house with balaclavas.  They entered roughly and they light us up with torches.  Then they said we want your son.  When I was still looking the Black one came again.  That Black one, I halt him, he was a CID.  Then I said Ezekiel is in the bedroom.  Then they said he must put on his clothes quickly, because they want him. I asked them where they are taking him to.  Then they told me that they are going to hit him.  Then I was frightened and then I closed the door.\n The following day, it was in the morning, at about three o'clock, I went to investigate where he is.  Then they said I should go to the police station, because they were having balaclavas I couldn't identify them.  We went to the police station.  At the police station they said my child is not there.  Whilst I was preparing myself to come back they said they came back from Orkney, they come from the scrapyards.  \n Then when I asked my son what he was doing there.  He told me that they were beating him in the dark on the ear with the clips and fists.  Then he had an ear problem. Then I took him to the doctor.  They only kept him in the hospital for that day.  They wanted bail of R100,00.  I paid KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 M MMOLAWA\nthat R100,00 bail.  \n Thereafter the case ran for three days, but there were no court proceedings, they were just postponing the case.  The court procedure completed in 1995, December.  That's when the case ended.  During that time I was taken him to various doctors.",

We know there was a time in our country when people were charged, youngsters, particularly were charged with public violence and thrown into jail.  And that a lot of things were done to them and many of them bear the scars of that today. In your case, Ezekiel, has a problem with his ear, which will probably be there for a very, very long time.  It is the legacy of the past that we have actually gone through.\n What is disquieting however, is that we rely on certain institutions to protect us, and the fact that were nameless and faceless people who came into your homes,  into your communities and who took police away, means that it is very, very difficult for us to understand why these things happened in that particular way.  But one of the jobs that we have to do, is to make sure that people are never able to act in that way again, that if they come to your home to take you away, they must have the proper documentation and they must have the proper authorisation to do these things.  Part of the job in our country is rebuilding all these structures.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n12 M MMOLAWA\n Your story shows that lots of things happened which even we don't really know about.  We will try to see what can be done about Ezekiel's ear, but thank you for sharing that with us.\nKLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
