<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Godfrey, you have come from Ikhutseng this morning, which is outside Potchefstroom?</p>

<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Can you please tell us who the lady is who is with you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> Godfrey, Commissioner Yasmin Sooka is going to help you in telling your story.  We are, of course, going back to the time when you were only 10 years old.  Before I ask her to start helping you, could you just stand to take the oath, please.</p>

<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>2 G T LESENYEHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> It was in 1986.  We were standing at a street corner.  At each corner of each street there was a group of youths and we were chanting freedom songs, but no stone-throwing was taking place.  As we were chanting, after a few minutes I saw a police Hippo coming and they started firing. I am referring to the soldiers.  We took different directions and people went to nearby places and I decided to run towards my home, because the tear-gas was now burning in my eyes.   I got into the house and my mother saw me and I was shouting "my eyes, my eyes".  She closed the doors and she applied Vicks and other ointments on my eyes, but they couldn't help at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a> In 1987 I have been to doctors and this other one was Dr Van Graan and my mother explained everything to him.  She told him that I was tear-gassed and my eyes are troubling me.  He said my mother must not tell that it was tear-gas that affected my eyes.   He said he will transfer me to St. John's and the tablets that he gave me were very strong.   Every time I put my glasses on I would be dizzy.  We went back to him to explain to him that I feel very dizzy every time I put on these glasses.  He then took me to St. John's. I was told that I will have to undergo an operation.  Yes, they operated me at St. John's and after the operation I lost my eyesight until at this stage where I cannot see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> Even now, I am suffering.  I should have been at school but I cannot, because my eyes are itching at all times and I am in and out of the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, Godfrey. I am going to ask you some questions, just to make sure that we get your story clearly.  Could you tell me, at the time before this happened, you were 10 years old.  In what standard were you at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>3 G T LESENYEHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I was doing Std 1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> At that time did you have any problem with your eyesight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you able to see normally until the tear-gassing incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Dr Van Graan who treated you, was he a doctor in your particular area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> Yes, he is a medical practitioner in our area and he is an eye-specialist and he hands out glasses, spectacles for people who have eye problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You mentioned in your evidence that he did not want you to say that the problem had happened because of the tear-gas.  Why was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I really do not know why he didn't want me to reveal that it was the tear-gas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> But did he say that the problem you were having with your eyes was because of the tear-gassing incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> No, he didn't say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did you give you a proper examination after the tear-gassing incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> No, I can't say he examined me. He just looked at me and he said I should get glasses and then he took me to the machines and I waited for a pair of glasses thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> The glasses didn't actually help you to see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> These glasses helped me but they were very strong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Godfrey, how long after the, after you had seen Dr Van Graan, did you go to St. John's Hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>4 G T LESENYEHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> It was in 1987 and in the same year I went to St. John's, but I have forgotten the month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> That is all right. When you went to St. John's, what did they tell you, what was wrong with your eyes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I do not know, they didn't even tell me what the problem was with my eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You were then completely unable to see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> That's correct, that was after the operation, until now I am totally blind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you able to complete school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I can be in a position to complete my schooling, that is if I get some kind of assistance, you know, maybe to go to special schools for blind people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Tell me, at the time when this incident happened, was there trouble in the township, between the soldiers and the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> It wasn't a problem between the soldiers and the community.  I must say people were complaining about so many deaths that were taking place, you know, the people were just shooting at random.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> At that time, were you a member of the comrades or any other political organisation in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> At that time I was doing what the community was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What was the community doing at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> They were unhappy because the police were shooting people in the township as they wished and people were dying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Godfrey, how old are you at this point in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I am 21 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> I notice in your statement that you say you</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>5 G T LESENYEHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>attend school at the Bartholomew School for the Blind. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Are they teaching you skills at that school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> We are taught like normal school children, but the skill that they are giving me, is the typing, you know, computer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And how are you being treated for your eyes? Do you still attend any hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> Yes, I still go to hospital for treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And is that helping you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> No, I don't get help, it doesn't help at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, Godfrey, I don't have any more questions.  But I am going to ask my fellow Commissioners if they want to ask you any questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Godfrey, I just want to ask you one question.  Can you remember how many days went by between the time that you were shot at with the tear-gas canister and you actually going to see Dr Van der Graaff?  Did you go the next day or did you go the next week?  Would you like a drink of water?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> You told us that you were shot in 1986 with the tear-gas canister. And afterwards you ran home to your mother and your mother put some Vicks into your eyes, and then you went to go and see Dr Van der Graaff.  How many days from the time of the shooting had gone by before you went to see the doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I can't remember, but I think there are records that will show when did I exactly go to the doctor, but I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Godfrey, just one question. Do you remember</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>KLERKSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>6 G T LESENYEHO</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>about when in 1986 this incident happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> I forget the day and the date. I have also forgotten the month, I only remember the year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> All right. Perhaps - is that your mother who is with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Maybe she can help you.  Or has she also forgotten?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESENYEHO:</span> She doesn't remember also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Well, that's all right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Godfrey, thank you for coming to tell us your story.  We have noted that you say that there are medical records available and I think we will ask our reparation committee to make sure that they are able to access those immediately, so that an assessment can be made of what exactly your condition is, because it is problematic that you lost your sight gradually and now have lost your sight completely.  We will be looking into the matter and will see what we can do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a> Godfrey, thank you for coming, your story is a very painful one and in fact is part of the sacrifices that very many young people like yourself have made towards contributing towards the change we have seen in our country.  I would like to thank you and your mother for coming today.  Thank you.</p>
