            "On the 29th of August - I was working at Lentegeur Hospital.  Thereafter, at 5 o'clock the evening I came home. I had been off for two days.  My uncle asked me to go and fetch Dawie, the deaf and dumb boy.  I went to fetch him in Weskop Avenue.   The bus didn't turn up and I went home.\nHe asked me to  go and look on the other side - in Wespoort Avenue and I went there.  I stood at the busstop -  myself, a postman and two boys, the 13 year old and the 11 year old.  The Riot Squad guys were hiding in other people's yard.  \nWhile the two boys were standing there, I told them they should go home or else something was going to happen.  The postman asked me why I was standing there and  I told him I was waiting for the deaf and dumb boy, for  Dawid  - and their bus didn't turn up.\nWhile we were standing there, suddenly they started shooting.  And when they started shooting, we ran.  I tripped and fell and the 11 year old boy fell on top of me.  I pushed him off me and I got up.  I looked for help and I was full of blood.  My nose and my mouth were bleeding and my clothes were full of blood.  The lady on the corner gave me a cloth.  I wiped my face and I went home and lay on the bed because I was dizzy.\nThe oldest child, Allen, phoned the ambulance.  The ambulance came to fetch me and took me to the hospital.  They assisted me into the ambulance because I was totally dizzy in my head and my body was shaking.  I was feeling utterly numb and thereafter  we went around to fetch the two boys.  I asked them where we were going.  And they said to me - no, they were going to take me to the police station and the two boys are going to be taken to the mortuary.  \nI got out of the ambulance and they put me in another ambulance.  We were taken to Groote Schuur Hospital.  I was in hospital for a month. I was discharged on the 22nd of the 4th  month 1987.\nBefore I was put into the other ambulance, the one policeman from the Riot Squad used violent language.  He called me a pig.  I said to him - \"what do you mean I am a pig?\"   He said to me - \"We should have shot you dead instead of the boy\".\nI said to him - \"If you had to shoot the boy dead, his father would have killed me\".  And he said to me - \"He can't help it, because we coloureds deserve it\".  Then I was taken to the hospital and since then  nothing has happened and I have been in a state of confusion ever since.\nI lost my one eye and it bothers me because I get these sharp pains in my eye.  I get migraines and then sometimes I want to have nothing to do with my children, because of my pain.  \nThis has caused me to lose my  job, my house and my medical aid benefits and I have got absolutely no income.  I would like you people to assist me in getting my job back.",

And as I said to you earlier, the matter is not finalized today - we are still busy looking at the matter and we will look at your circumstances as well and we will be in contact with you and thank you very much for coming.\nAnd thank you very much to you as well sir, for coming and supporting your wife.",
