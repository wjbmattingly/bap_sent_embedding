            "Before start I would like to indicate some few ground rules.  Firstly about the photo opportunity.  It has been the ruling of this Commission and of the - this session that a photo opportunity of the witnesses and everybody else who needs to be photograph or who the photographers need to photograph should take place at the beginning as it is now taking place.\n But that when once the evidence begins to be led, the photographers will have to leave.  That has been the ruling and that is the ruling that we still want to uphold.  I would therefore like to think that we will have every co-operation from the camera persons as far as that goes.\n Secondly I would like to indicate that this session is a continuation of  a similar session that has gone on before in November of last year.  We are dealing with issues that we have dealt with then, and I would assume that the same reaction that took place then is likely to occur.  But let me indicate that we would appeal to everyone who is affected by the events and the circumstances about which there will be [indistinct] in this proceedings - to be as tolerant as possible.  We are sure as a Commission and as this particular Committee that we have taken every precaution to let everybody understand that we want to come to the truth and expose the truth through the proceedings in a manner that is as transparent but which is as fair as it can possibly be.\n I am sure in my own mind that the families or those associated with the families, who's emotion by what went on the last time to an extend that there was a complaint from the witnesses throwing off shoes and stuff - I am very confident that we will not have a reputation of that sort of reaction.\n But having said that, I want to make it very clear that we understand the feelings that go through those who lost their people in the events about which we  are going to be taking evidence from witnesses.  But I want to emphasise that our training and the attitude of the Commission and this Committee in particular, has led us to accept that there are always two sides to a story and that all the sides should always be given an fair opportunity to be heard.\n Now having said all of that I need to say that there is a perception that members of the media project this hearing in a way that suggest to some that the Committee or the Commission has already taken a view point as to the guilty or otherwise of those who testified, especially the witnesses - the police witnesses.\nNow if there is such a perception to the extend that the Commission is able to dispel such a view and we are wanting to indicate that speaking for myself, I have not found this to be so, but it has been so - and I would like to direct myself to the mass media that there should be an understanding that this is a hearing and a hearing about which no finding has been made and a hearing in relation to which a finding will be made in due course and that until such time as the Committee expressed themselves as to what they find and that will be done in due course.\n The attitude by the media should be that of fair reporting, but I don't want to enter into a debate with the media.  I don't want to lay an accusing hand at their door, I simply want to say there have been perceptions that is the way in which they project the proceedings.  And I would really like to prevail upon them to be as good as they have always been to us and also to make sure that if such perceptions arise from the manner in which they appear to be reporting the proceedings - that they should have a re-look and satisfy themselves that they project the proceedings as fairly as they possibly can.\n We - I have to ask the legal representatives of the witnesses to place themselves on record.  I see that we have got new comers to these proceedings which we didn't have the last time and I would therefore like them to place themselves on record.",
