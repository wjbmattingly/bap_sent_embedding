The device enables you to listen in on the evidence in a language that you can follow.  Let me just explain that - this box section of the unit can be utilized, firstly to tune into the language that you would like to listen in on and also to adjust the volume of the set.\nNow, the channels are as follows.   On channel one you will be able to listen in,  in Afrikaans.  On  channel two you can listen in, in English and in channel three you can listen in,  in Xhosa.  And then the second button simply is to adjust the volume.  Thank you.\nAnd of course, we want to ask you, when you leave the hall to leave the head-sets behind on your chair and not to take it with  or out with you.  We need to have them re-charged, otherwise they are not worth much to us.\nMs Mxinwa, good morning to you, can you hear the voice over the headphones?",

And we remember the story of how those seven  young men were shot and killed - of the funeral that happened about 10 or 12 days later with the tremendous attendance of the people from the community of six  of those men.\nAnd since that time, when you came to tell us before, our investigating team have been working very hard to try and find out exactly what happened on that day.  And we hope that today and tomorrow things will become more clear and you will have answers to some of the questions you have been asking for so long.\nYou told us then what you knew, about what had happened, but I wonder whether you would like to tell us anything more or tell us what is on your heart  today.",

The incident was on the Monday.  We searched at hospitals.  We thought  maybe he might had been in an accident.  We searched in prisons.  We did not find him the entire week.\nWhat delayed the whole search was that I had lost a grandchild.  The following week we found him in a mortuary.   I could not go myself,   I sent some people.  My husband had also recently died.  I had not yet healed,   I was still very weak.  So I sent some people to go to the mortuary and they found the corpse there.   They took his ID to the mortuary, that's how they could identify him.  \nWell apparently he was one of the children who had been shot in Guguletu.  But I would like to know why it was that my son was shot.  I do not know why he was shot.  I asked myself this question.  It is still not answered.  Why did the police shoot our children?  With no - for no apparent reason.  What did our children do that they deserved death?",
