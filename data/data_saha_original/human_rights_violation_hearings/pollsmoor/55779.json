The one, if I remember well, was white in colour and the other, light blue.  There were white men standing next to these Kombi's.   I did not know what was going to happen.  A short while after my bath, I heard a noise like a collision - two cars colliding.  (Making noise) when I looked, there were two white men shooting.   At the time, there were no shacks, it was just a forest.  I saw people running towards the forest, they was getting shot at.\nThe white man were along NY1, next to my restaurant  - there was chaos.  The others went into the forest.  Until such  time  that they shot the window of my house, of the room that I was in,  because I tried to hide, but I was curious.\n And I looked,  I saw someone, I don't know where he emanated from.  It was a black man - he was being called by the white men.   He lifted his hands up in the air and they took a gun from his waste.   They snatched the gun out of his waste.   Immediately after that, a white man from NY1, just above the restaurant, called out - saying skiet hom.  He called out again, shoot him.  He was kneed on the back and he fell on his back and was shot twice.\nThe first bullet went off and the second one, and he died.   I was watching, because I was looking with my one eye from my window, he had died.  Another black man emanated again from the forest with white men, he had a plastic bag.  He was wearing denim pants.  He had a woolen hat on his head.  I don't know what he was carrying in this plastic bag.\nThey walked to the place where the other person had been shot.  I don't know how many people were there,  but when this group came, I saw the white man washing off the blood of the  people that had been shot.  I then went and prepared my breakfast.  I could not go to work that day, because these white men were blocking the cars from moving, both at NY1 and NY111.\nThat is all I have to say for now.",

You were asked what happened to the person who ran into the  bush and you said you don't know.  Whereas it is easy to have tried to make out that  -   [indistinct] and we thank you for your  contribution in our search for the truth.\nThank you for your contribution as we are trying to get to the truth, thank you very much.",
