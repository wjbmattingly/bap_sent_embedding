            "Thank you sir.  In 1985 the police were after my twins, Zandisile and Zanisile.  They were looking all over for them.  They would come at my home looking for them and they would be all around the house searching for them and they would keep the doors with their guns and my twins would go on the backdoor and run and they would come in and ask - where are the twins?  And we would tell them that we don't know where they are.  They didn't spend the night here.\nWe were suffering because of this treatment.  Because they would gather around the house the whole night looking for my twins and they would do this constantly.   We couldn't sleep and still 1985, my other son, we sent my other son in the shop and he came that day, saying that Mongazi was arrested and I asked why was he arrested - they said that they don't know, because he didn't do anything.\nWe went to the police station - we asked why was Mongazi arrested and they said he was throwing stones and Mongazi denied that.  He said he didn't do that, but they just arrested him.  And we went back to the police station and they released him on free bail.   And they said we must look after him.\nWe went back home with him.  On the following day, when we woke up, he was not there.  We looked all around the township.  We looked for Mongazi and we heard that he went to Cape Town - one of my twins went to Cape Town to look for him and he said that he didn't find him.  They told him that he already left Cape Town and he was going to Happy where he was.  And we stayed without my son, Mongazi.\nAnd we suffered a lot because the police were also looking for my other son Mongazi.   They used to come and ask where he was and we told them that he left and we don't know where he was.  And after that the police were kicking the doors every time.  Looking for the twins and we told them we don't know where the twins were.\nOne day they came, at about 10 o'clock, they woke me up, together with my husband.  They told us to go to the lounge  to sit in the lounge and we - they came in the house and searched the house - we asked them what were they looking for?   They said, they were looking for guns, because  my sons had guns in the house.   And we told them that we didn't see any guns in the house.  They searched the whole house,  saying that they were looking for this guns.  \nSometimes they used to come in the morning and they stayed in the house for the whole day.  And we wanted to look for their badge in order for us to identify them, but we couldn't see the badges, because they were wearing the uniform, the dark uniform and my husband couldn't even go to work,  because of this.\nAnd my twins decided to leave in 1986 and they disappeared.  We didn't know where they were, but one of them use to contact us and tell us that they are all right.  We need not to worry.  End of Tape 1, Side A ... this.  We told them that\nwe are not well at home,  because of this and they arrested my husband once and my twins ran away.   They came here in Cape Town.\nAnd then one day I decided to come here to Cape Town to look for them, because at this time they were not contacting us.  And then I told my husband I was going to Cape Town to look for my sons and we both decided to come here in Cape Town and we were told that they were in Athlone.   I wanted to go there, but I was not allowed to go to Athlone to look for them and we went back.  It was on Sunday, that time, we went back home.\nOn Tuesday, one police - one black policeman came and he asked me where my husband was.  And then I said he was at work.  And this policeman told us that one of my twins have been shot.",

He was the one who was shot. \nAfter that, people used to come and pray for us at home, and the police would come and they would ask the people to go away - not to pray for us.  They gave us a date for the funeral and we didn't want to bury my son on that day,  but we were forced by the police to do that.  After that there was no peace at my home, we were suffering.  And they were looking for the other twin, and they use - they use to come to try and bribe the person, the people in the township, because they told the people in the township that my son was a terrorist and if someone could come and tell the police where he was, they would get money, they would receive money.\nAnd my son was nowhere to be found, but apparently the police found him.   He was arrested here in Cape Town, but I am not sure about the place and then they transferred him to Malmesbury.  And then they took him to Victoria.  They were torturing him all this time.\nAfter that my husband became sick - as they were looking for my son, they used to arrest my husband.   And they used to cover his face with the black plastic bags,  asking him where my twin was.   They were torturing him all the time.  And they were torturing his genitals.  And he became sick because of all this.  He couldn't even continue working.  So he was not working at this time.  One day when I looked at him, his ears were bleeding and he suffered a lot until he died.  He wanted my twin to be back, because this was affecting him, this  disappearance.\nWhat I forgot, is that after we buried the other twin, the following day, a police van came and then the police took me with the van.  They took me to the police station and they asked me who were the leaders in the funeral.  Who were the people giving speeches there in the funeral.  And then I told them I did not know, because I was not looking at the people who were talking there, because I was still in pain, because my son had tied.\nAnd then they said that my husband has told them everything.  So, I should tell them everything.  And they were lying, because my husband didn't say anything to them.   My husband died in 1987.   We were suffering all the time and the police were rude.  They were not respecting us, they were beating us, .  assaulting us all the time.  They used to take the whole family and arrest the whole family.

            "Ma'am, sometimes we don't believe the stories we hear.  And then we are here today listening to the stories from people like you, because we could see you were not staying  at peace in your home.  Because if one can see you today, one cannot think you were suffering, because your son was killed, your husband was tortured and you were also arrested.\nThese are the stories that we want our children to remember.  We want them to remember that we paid a price in order for us to be free today.  We thank you a lot ma'am,  for what you did in your family.\nWe say that we hope that the Lord will support and comfort you and strengthen you, because we don't have any more words to comfort you.  Your story is so unbelievable, one cannot believe that this things were happening in our country and we want all people of this country not to repeat what happened in the past.\nThank you ma'am.",
