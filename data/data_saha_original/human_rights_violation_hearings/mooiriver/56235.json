            "Good morning, and welcome to the third and last day of the public hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Mooi River.  We apologise for the late start this morning.  We were expecting a number of witnesses from the Bergville/Woodford area, but our driver, who went up there this morning, reported that a number of people from that area who were going to give evidence this morning have decided not to give evidence because of a generalised fear and a feeling of intimidation, and they have chosen not to give evidence this morning.  In their place we're going to receive, later on this morning, a short submission from a community worker from the Bergville area, just to give us a background on the political conflict in that area in the late 1980s.\nFor those of you who are not able to follow the evidence, which will be given largely in Zulu today, there are simultaneous translation earphones, and you will hear the evidence, which will be given in Zulu, it will be translated into English, which you can receive on channel six.  Please, when you leave the hall at lunch time or at the end of the day please remember to leave these earphones behind.  They don't work outside of the hall and they are very expensive.  We do have statement-takers from our - Truth Commission statement-takers here in the canteen area.  If there are people who wish to make statements, who haven't had an opportunity to do so already, they can see one our statement-takers and make a statement relating to what happened to them. We will start then with the first witness, who is Mrs Tryphina Masondo, if she can please come up.  Good morning, Mrs Masondo.  We welcome you here today.  You, like all the witnesses yesterday, are from Brandville township, and you have come here today to talk about the death of your daughter, Alexia Sithole, in December 1991.  Before you give that evidence - Mrs Masondo, we know from listening to many, many other stories like yours how difficult it is to relive those experiences, and please take your time and recover yourself.  We know how difficult it is to speak about the loss of a child.  (Pause)  Before you tell your story you will be required to take the oath, and I am not going to ask you to stand up.",

            "  Early in the morning, it was still dawn, you couldn't see from far, my daughter was sleeping somewhere, or my granddaughter, and then she came and knocked at the door.  When I opened the door she entered and she said Inkatha people were attacking.  When I looked through the window I saw a flame, and other houses were in flames.  And we woke up, me and my late daughter.  We were sleeping in the dining-room, and I was confused at that time.  When I woke up I took everything that was in the dining-room.  I didn't even see my daughter getting out of the house and running away.  And my grandchildren wanted clothes to wear so that they run away as well, but because I was confused I couldn't help them.  When Inkatha group was next door I realised that they were near, I was the next one.  I opened the wardrobe, I put my grandchildren in there, and when I asked them where my daughter was they told me she ran into the garage.  When I went to the garage I realised that it was locked.  And then I asked them.  They insisted that she was in the garage.  At that time they came.  They didn't use the gate.  They were from my neighbour.  They didn't use the gate to enter my house, and one of them screamed and said, \"Here there's no one because the gate is open.\"  One of them stood there next to the fence and took a stone, threw the stone through the window.  And then I realised that maybe the person saw me.  When I went to the dining-room they threw another stone in the dining-room, and then they left, they continued.  Later soldiers came and they asked me if there's anything wrong, and I told them no, nothing was damaged except for my windows.  And then they came back - now Inkatha members.  When they were at the gate they saw the soldiers.  One of them said, \"Here are the soldiers,\" and then they ran and they disappeared.",

When I was at the gate Tryphina Mchunu came.  She was carrying a baby, and she said to me, \"Mrs Makatini, here's the child.\"  I said, \"Whose child?\"  She said it was Mamo's child, and then I said, \"Where is Mamo?\"  And then she said to me, \"I heard that she ran away and she left her child.\"   And then I asked her, \"Now, how come you have the child?\"  She said, \"Sibongile gave me, and Sibongile said she was given the baby by the soldiers.\"  I took the baby, I went inside the house.  I took a blanket, a small blanket, I wrapped the baby behind my back, and then I told my grandchildren that I was going out to look for my daughter.  And then my grandchildren asked me where.  I said, \"I don't know, but I am going to look for her.\"  When I left my house at the gate I met Tryphina again, and then now she was with other women.  And then she said to me, \"I was scared to tell you, but Mamo has passed away.\"  And then I asked Tryphina, \"Why didn't you tell me?\"   She said she was scared.  And then I went there to look for her body.  I found her there.  I found her lying dead, and her stomach was big and her mouth was wide open, and her eyes were opened as well.  I called her.  She couldn't reply.  I came closer to her body.  I closed her mouth, I closed her eyes, and I managed to do so.  At that time ANC youth came and asked me, \"What happened?\" and they asked me if it was her, and I told them yes, it was her, and they sympathised with me.  These boys took grass and tried to bury the blood.  And these were young boys, ANC young boys, and they helped me.  And they said to me, \"We were just passing, going to look for more damage,\" and I was left there with my daughter or my granddaughter.   And my granddaughter told me that she was going to fetch a blanket, and she went there to bring a blanket.  And police came, I was still there, and they took her body.  And when I asked the police if I had to leave with them now they said, \"No, we can't take you together with the body because we are still going around taking more corpses, but we will take your name.\"  And I gave them my name, Tryphina Masondo, I gave them my address, 43, and they told me they will come back if there's a need for them to come and fetch me.

Your daughter died on the 4th of December 1991, and we've heard several other stories from people who were here yesterday and the day before about that particular night.  She died in what has become known as the Second Brandville Massacre, and from the information that we have received from other people, and from what we've been told by the police and others, 18 people died on that night when residents of the hostel left ... (incomplete - end of Side A, Tape 1) ... were women, and your daughter was one of those people.  As I said yesterday, it is difficult for us to understand the brutality of people, of armed men, men with spears and guns, who would attack defenceless, unarmed people.  The image of a woman fleeing with a baby on her back is an image which should evoke sympathy in most people, and it is very difficult to understand what caused those people to kill a person like your daughter.\nBut you story is important, it helps us to gain an idea of exactly what happened in those days, and your daughter's death is more than just a statistic, it's a real story now, and it helps us when we have to prepare our report.  It helps us to gain that knowledge of what really took place on that day.  So, while we understand how painful it is for you, we want to assure you that it's important that you have come here today and told us your story, and we thank you for being brave enough to have done so.  Thank you very much indeed.\n/CHAIRMAN",

And they called me at the Mthethwa household to come and witness what had happened because they had killed Mthethwa's son.  And they also called me to my place because the place was full of soldiers.  There were white soldiers at my place whilst I was at the neighbour's place, and when I got there they were pointing guns.  They were inside my bedroom.  These were policemen.  And my sons told me that these were policemen, because I could not differentiate between the soldiers and the police.  To me they are one and the same thing.  And I screamed when I got into the house because I saw this large number of police who were in my house, and I was asking myself as to what was happening.  And they said I should shut my mouth, and I said I was not talking to them, I was just asking Jesus as to what was happening to me.  There is another Madlala boy by the name of Pilo who came to ask me as to what was happening.  They asked the police as to what the police were doing in my house.  They said they were doing their duties.  And at that time they went out.  They spoke to these people who had come to assist me.  They negotiated outside and they said that they were conducting a search, and some of the people who were inside the house woke up after realising that there was a large group of police.  Then they left my place.  I went out and I went back to where I was before at the neighbour's place, and at 4.00 am the following morning when I was proceeding home from my neighbour's place I saw a large group of people approaching, and I realised that the impi was accosting us and it was going to launch an attack.  I ran into the house and alerted my children that a group of Inkatha members was approaching, and that we should find a place to flee.  And they told us that there are some people who had already been killed at that time, and I hid myself into the house.  At that time we heard gunfire from outside.  It sounded like a thunderstorm, and we were scared to even get out of the house.  We were hiding ourselves under the beds.  Some got into the wardrobes.

This went on for quite some time, then thereafter there was some quiet and peace.  We went out to investigate as to what was happening.  It was very quiet.  We heard people screaming, shouting and crying. Everyone was crying.  There were screams, cries, all around the place.  After quite some time we heard that certain people had been killed, quite a number of households had been attacked, and people had been hacked and shot to death.  And thereafter my elder son came back.  They had gone to Makatini's house to hear about the death of Makatini's son, as well as Mthethwa's son, but they turned back along the way when they came across the impi and they ran into my neighbour's place.  And Sibusiso ran and went to the bridge next to Luzeke.  That is where they got him when he was running away from them, and he was stabbed.  They left him for dead.  And at that time I didn't know where my son was, and a certain boy from the Indaba family came and he told me that he had come before, but the soldiers refused him permission to go through and come to my place.  Now he had come in the morning to come and find out whether we had survived the previous night's attack.  I told him that I couldn't get hold of Sibusiso, I do not know as to where Sibusiso is, and he said to me that we should go and look for him.  And at that time I felt very powerless because I suspected that something was wrong.  I could feel it.  We went looking for a car, and we decided to follow the Luzetha route because I suspected that he was running away from the Inkatha members, so that's the only direction he could have taken, the Luzetha route.  We saw a large group of boys and we asked them as to whether they had seen Sibusiso.  They said they were running or fleeing with him the previous night, and that he proceeded to the Luzetha route, and we could look for him along the route to Luzetha.  We proceeded, and when we got to the bridge we saw his body lying there on the ground.  He was cold.  (Pause)  ",

As I've said to a witness yesterday, when this thing happened in 1991 there were some newspaper reports about it, and they just simply reported that 18 people had died, and they went on to talk about the nature of the conflict in Brandville.  But you have told us in your evidence today in detail about what happened, and in such detail that we could almost - if we closed our eyes we could almost hear the sounds of the gunshots and we could almost see the flames burning the buildings.  And it's very important that you tell that story, not only for the people who are here, who were there and who know about that, but also for our records and for the press and the television.  It's important that you tell the story in the way that you did.   And it's a very sad story for someone like you to tell about the death of their child.  Many other witnesses who have come to this Commission have told about the death of their children, and we have seen many people like you becoming sad and upset, and we're very sorry about what happened and we extend our deep sympathy to you.  So, while we know it's hard for you it's still very important that you came here and told us that story, and told us in detail how it happened, so we want to thank you very much for that.

And in the same way you and your husband and children, you weren't taking part in any violence, you were running away from it.  You were afraid of it, and you were running away from it, and while you were running away from it your husband died.  And that's something that we've heard all over the country, is the completely random nature of the violence, and the fact that so many of the victims were innocent people, and worse, so many of them were women and children.\nSo, we can see how the events of those days have affected you.

            "  Okay.  On the 10th of November 1993 Clare, who as then 34 years old, and the single parent, the single mother of the two children, was hijacked near her home in Mangusi ... (inaudible - end of Side A, Tape 2) ... the 9th.  Several men unknown to locals approached people in Mangusi asking - and speaking Zulu with a Thonga accent, and asked where the white woman agricultural worker lived.  The next morning, that's November the 10th, at about 6.00 am a neighbour, a young girl, was approached by a stranger, speaking normal Zulu, who asked who was the owner of the 4x4 vehicle parked nearby, and she said that it was Clare's, and the man identified himself as Hazel Buthelezi.  At 7.15 Clare left for work.  Shortly afterwards people still at her house heard the vehicle stopping, and then there was one hoot from the vehicle, but they didn't go down, they didn't - then between that 7.15 am and 8.00 various local people saw the vehicle being driven rather erratically by somebody they didn't know.  It was a very noticeable vehicle because it had the co-operative logo of a cattle -of a cow's head on the - painted on the vehicle.  The driver was driving fast and erratically, and several times took little side roads off the main Mangusi/Jozini road.  Between 8.15 and quarter to nine we presume that she was killed, because at 9.00 am the vehicle arrived in Ingwavuma at a petrol station and there was only a single man in the vehicle.  In the middle of the morning the vehicle, again quite an easily identifiable vehicle, was seen nearby Mfakayi on the road just 30 kilometres north of Mtubatuba, and the person who saw it, who was a member of the co-operative, said there were three or four people in the cab at the time.  And I forgot to say at - before the vehicle arrived in Ingwavuma for petrol the bakkie stopped and picked up a hitch-hiker.  This was when the stranger was driving the vehicle and Clare was sitting in the front.  They stopped and picked up a 13-year-old girl, and later dropped her somewhere towards Jozini, or somewhere further along the road.  Then at 1.15 in Empangeni the bakkie was involved in a minor traffic accident near the road going to Ngwelezana, and when the traffic officer pulled the vehicle over the driver ran off, and an AK47 was found behind the seat of the cab.  We didn't know what had happened to Clare, and for two weeks we had no information and we had no knowledge.  We had no idea what had happened to her.  ---   We searched in various places, in Mangusi, in Empangeni, and the area in between.   ---   And then on the 24th of November a cowherd found her skeleton on the road going up to Ingwavuma, the dirt road going up to Ingwavuma.  It was just five metres or so from the road, but the road's cut on a hillside, so it was above the road and totally invisible from the road.  And then we buried her on the 6th of December in Mariannhill.  At her body, at her skeleton, there were two spent cartridges, and she had been shot through the head and her hands were tied.   ---  We strongly - Clare's family strongly believe that this was a political killing.  Amnesty International has made a major campaign based on the same belief, and the whole style of the killing somehow, from the evidence collected, seems to be that of a hit.  It was fast, organised, shot through the head, no other shots, and it seemed all to have been over within an hour or an hour and a half of the hijack.  There was a police investigation, which went on for quite some time.  The police reports concluded that it cannot be assumed without facts that the deceased was a victim of extra-judicial execution, but - well, we think the police could not conclude that it was an extra-judicial killing, but we also believe that the police were  in no way competent to investigate the various security forces.  And one of the investigating officers was actually at the time facing a court case from Sipho Cele, the father of Clare's second child, alleging assault.  The same investigating officer, Captain Erasmus, was previously censured in court for covering up misdeeds of fellow officers.  So we think he was not in a particularly strong position to investigate the political or security aspects of the murder.  The other investigating officer, Sergeant van der Westhuizen, who was the principal investigating officer, was, by his junior rank, also in a weak position to investigate. ",

And we know that the matter has been investigated by the police, that an inquest was held, and our investigators also have all the documents, but at this stage we are, as you know, not really any closer to finding out how or why Clare died.  However, we know that it is your view, and the view of many people who knew her, and knew what work she did, that this was a political killing.  We know about her background.  We know about her ANC membership after 1990.  You have told us about her activities in the ANC in that area, the nature of her work that she did for the local community.  All these things would make her a target for a political killing in a politically divided and politically sensitive area.  She was a committed and a dedicated person, who worked incredibly hard for her community, and also worked hard in the pursuit of a vision for a new South Africa, a new South Africa which she was not able to experience.",

            "Mrs Sithole, thank you very much for coming in.  Your story has been similar to so many other stories that we've heard over the last two days.  We know that it's a very special story to you, it's a unique and individual story, but it is very similar in the sorts of events that you describe to many other stories that we've heard.\nYou told us about your husband, who, coming back from work in a taxi, an ordinary person doing what was expected of him, working to support his family, and tragically he was killed for no apparent reason whatsoever.  And this has been the story of many victims that we've heard of in the last two days.  \nAnd so, while we know it's been difficult for you to come and relive those experiences, it's important for us to learn your story first-hand, and we thank you very much for having had the courage to come here and tell us that\nstory.  Thank you very much indeed.\n/CHAIRMAN",

            "Mrs Sithole was the last witness that we will hear.  We were going to hear evidence from a group of people from Bergville.  As I said this morning they were too afraid to come in.  And we had hoped to hear a short submission from some community representatives from Bergville, but they returned to Bergville with one of their community members, who unfortunately had become so emotional at the prospect of giving evidence about the death of her son that she had to return home.  So, unfortunately we will not hear evidence from any witnesses from Bergville today.\nWe have been to many areas around this province and also in the Free State.  We have been to places where there has been terrible violence, like Port Shepstone and Empangeni, but the stories that we've heard here in Brandville we believe have been worse than any others that we've heard.  We've heard about people who were fleeing from violence, who were pursued into the sanctity of a church, and in that church a disabled person, a woman and a child were shot, completely defenceless people.  We heard about an elderly woman of 65 who was brutally stabbed with her 18-year-old granddaughter, and of a six-year-old child who had a large rock thrown on her chest and was left for dead.  And we heard this morning about Alexia Masondo, who was again fleeing from violence with a baby on her back, and who was stabbed and killed.  We have yet to understand why these sorts of atrocities took place, why it was necessary for people to kill disabled people and elderly and young women.  It's a very difficult thing for us to understand.  \nWe had hoped very, very much to hear the perspective  /on the\non the violence in this area from the Inkatha Freedom Party, and we tried very, very hard to persuade members of the IFP to come here to give us their perspective.  We contacted their representatives, we sent our statement-takers to Brandville, and to the hostel.  They were not able to get access to the hostel.  We wrote to Midlands IFP office, we requested them to come here to make a submission.  We said that even if they didn't want to make a submission they could make a written submission, and they refused to participate with us because they said that they believed that we would not be able to bring about reconciliation.  \nThey did give us their submissions which they made some years ago to the Goldstone Commission, and reference was made to that document by Dr Minnaar, who was a social scientist who we invited here to give evidence on the first day of these hearings.  And we invited him because we believed that he would be able to give an overall, professional and independent perspective on the conflict in Brandville.  He is not affiliated to any group, and we felt that it would be important for him to give his view, which would include the perspective of the IFP from that period.  And in my view he did give a very thorough overview, and he talked about the manner in which the hostel residents were excluded from civic and community life, and how on many occasions they were harassed and attacked by certain people within the township.  But he was not able to explain to us how it came about that the attacks which the hostel dwellers perpetrated on the residents of this township - how it was that they were so brutal in their nature, and so indiscriminate in their targets, and that is something that we still have to understand.\nFor real reconciliation to take place in Brandville there must be acknowledgement by both sides as to their roles in what took place, and there must also be a very genuine desire to reconcile with each other, because without proper reconciliation the chances of that sort of violence happening again are good, and I am sure the people of Brandville do not want to see - or do not want to experience anything like what they went through in 1990 and 1991 again.  And the TRC, the Truth Commission, can play a part in bringing those two sides together.  We have played that role in other areas, such as Trust Feeds, and if there is a willingness and a desire from the IFP, or from the hostel residents and the people of Brandville, then the TRC can play a facilitating role to try to bring those two groups closer together.\nBrandville is really like - it's like a microcosm or a small version of the country.  On a national level if we don't have reconciliation it's very difficult for this country to move forward positively.  In the same way in Brandville, if there's no true reconciliation between the hostel residents and the Brandville residents, the township residents, it's very difficult for there to be positive progress and unity in this area.  So we ask the people of Brandville to consider that.\nWe want to thank the witnesses very much for coming forward.  It was very brave of them to come forward and tell those terrible stories, and we want to thank them and congratulate them.  And we want to thank everybody else, the volunteer staff who assisted them in the debriefing,  the TRC staff, the police who protected us here, the press\nand the television.  And finally for the people of Brandville, who came and gave us their support every day, we hope that it was meaningful for you to hear the experiences of your fellow residents being told.  Sorry, I forgot to thank the sound people and the interpreters. Thank you very much.\nDr Mgojo will now say a few words in Zulu, and end off with a prayer.",

            "I appreciate the opportunity that I have been given.  I think particularly of people like Chief Luthuli when I hear the stories that are told in this hall. Chief Luthuli would turn in his grave if he would listen to such stories.  I hope even where he is he would be shocked when he hears stories about children being killed, and he would be shocked at the idea of black against black violence.  And when we talk about the residents of Brandville as well as the hostel dwellers we refer to one family, the royal family.  They were under one chief, that is the Zulu chief.  I do not say that even the previous chiefs like Chief Hlatshwayo, who went into exile, as well as Demizulu, they were fighting for the building of the nation.  They were finishing off from where Shaka left.  We were a united nation ... (inaudible - end of Side A, Tape 3) ... our new Government, democratically elected Government, not the apartheid regime, has been blessed by the Lord above that it's very painful to try and effect reconciliation.  We know that we cannot raise up the dead, we do not have those powers, but the aim of the Government is to bring about a reconciliation, but that cannot be  effected if we are not united.  We regard ourselves as all\nelements of human nature, and we cannot keep on killing each other in the manner that we are doing.  We are trying to effect reconciliation and be one nation which is living in peace.  Our ancestors suffered under the apartheid regime, and now we have acquired this freedom, but there was so much bloodshed.  We do sympathise with the families that have lost their loved ones.  \nAs Richard Lyster had already mentioned that what disturbs us most is that some other people who were supposed to have come to testify were not able to come before this Commission because they had been threatened.  Some felt not safe at all to come and testify before this Commission, for instance the Bergville group.  Others have got their own reasons for not coming.  Maybe they were also scared or threatened, or members of their own groups or political groups were not present, but we wished that everybody could have come so that we hear different sides of the story.  We are indiscriminate in this, we want to get both sides of the story.  \nBut we do appreciate the fact that there were those who had the courage to appear before this Commission to render their testimony.  You will remember that yesterday there is a witness who could not give her testimony, she was in an emotional state.  And one had to be sent to the hospital today - she was from Bergville - because she collapsed because of a reason that I am not going to explain.  She was unable to continue.\nIf there is any person who knows, or who is a perpetrator himself or herself, for there to be reconciliation these persons must come forward.  These  people were created by God.  We therefore do not have a\nright to kill them.  We think that Brian Mitchell was a good example.  He asked to be put together with the families of the victims so that he can personally apologise to these people.  He wanted to be brought together with the people of Trust Feeds so that he could approach them and apologise for all his past atrocities against the Trust Feeds community.  \nNow, if the killers are not prepared to come forward and ask for forgiveness we cannot effect reconciliation.  We hope that you, as the community of Brandville, also would like to get an opportunity to see the perpetrators, and maybe ask some questions, so that whatever questions you had in the past could possibly be answered.  We have lost quite a large number of youths who could be helping towards the upgrading of the country.  \nAt first even when there were wars or there were faction fights the basic rule was that women and children would not be killed, and people who seek refuge in churches would not be followed to the churches, where they would be killed, but these are the things we are hearing in this Commission today, where people are attacked after having sought refuge in church.  This indicates that there is a lot to be desired in our society.\nI will request you, after we have finished here, to sing the national anthem to bring ourselves together as one.  That's why we've kept this song, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, because it brings us together.  I want us to sing this with dignity.  I want us to feel that we are talking to God.  We have suffered so much as the black nation, and now that we have this budding democracy we should have  some reconciliation, we should have some peace, otherwise\nwe will not feel or experience the newfound freedom.  Because this freedom was bought with the blood of innocent people.  People died for this freedom to be attained, so we must ask the Lord to help and give courage to those who lost their loved ones, and for the Lord to lift the weight that is on the shoulders of those who lost their loved ones.\nPROCEEDINGS CLOSED WITH THE NATIONAL ANTHEM",
