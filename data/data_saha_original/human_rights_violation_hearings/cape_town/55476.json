I went in and I saw the car and I didn't see my father in the car.  As I was coming closer and when I got there, there were people that I saw there. When they were running, the police came.  They said what do we want. I said this is my father.  They took me to Guguletu and asked me for a statement.  I said I couldn't give a statement, I wasn't there.  So I went back home, I told my mother.  And they said they were looking for me.  The people I know who saw him and indeed there were people who saw him.  I ran to KTC.  They looked for me and they found me.  Two men came. They pointed at me with guns.  They took me away to KTC.  At KTC there was a tyre and a five-litre tin of petrol. They said who did you see.  I said no, I didn't see anyone.  Another comrade helped me, who said he was ...  He said they couldn't burn me after they had burnt my father.    And that's how I escaped.  Then I left.\n Then at home my mother is sick and the next day the house was burnt. Then we went and fled to freedom. Then we went to Khayelitsha after that. Then we got a place at B.
