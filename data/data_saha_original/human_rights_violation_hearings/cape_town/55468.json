            "If I may continue.  Leonard Knipe, I am a Director in the South African Police Service, I am the Provincial Commander of the serious violent crimes component of the Western Cape.\n I am based at the Provincial Head Office of the Detective service in Bellville.  On Thursday, the 05-06-1997 I was approached by Miss Gould, an investigator of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and requested to give evidence at a special hearing of the Commission of the 10-06-1997.\n I have been requested to give evidence concerning an arrest in 1986 on a charge of sedition against the community leader and parliamentary member of the National Party, Mr Johnson Ngxobongwana.\n The quest to appear is rather short and due to the time constraints I had been unable to trace documents, case dockets which may still be available and if traced, would have placed me in a better position to give accurate evidence.\n The evidence which I am able to give is from recall and after discussions with Captain Jooste of the Murder and Robbery Unit on Friday, the 06-06-1997.  Captain Jooste then a Warrant Officer, served with me for a short period at Guguletu.  I was assigned to Guguletu to investigate the murders, mostly necklace murders and other violence that occurred in Guguletu during 1986.\n Of the violence that occurred was against the Security Forces and institutions of the State while the other violence was intersectorial violence against opposing groups, each with different political agendas.\n I was transferred to Guguletu during June, that would have been towards the end of June, late June 1986 and took over command of a task team assigned to investigate the violence from Captain Loocke.\n The task team was under resourced and under-staffed, nevertheless we endeavoured to solve the murders and other acts of violence which were reported.  It appeared and later became clear that many of the murders that we were dealing with, resulted after the victims had been tried at people's courts which were being practised by both the opposing parties in interfactional violence.\n As a strategy we established when these people's courts were held and would then raid these courts and effect arrests.  Arrestees were charged with sedition and other crimes which we were able to substantiate.\n It was a strategy which worked and helped stabilise the township.  Two young men Vioani Geobase and Lukasine Veneni were brutally murdered during July in 1986.\n The murders were investigated by the task team under cover of Guguletu CR/12/7/96.  From the investigations conducted in this case, it was determined that prior to their deaths, they had been in the company of two young ladies.\n These ladies were traced and with the assistance on the 21-07-1986 a shack in Crossroads was raided.   This shack contained cells and a court room and it was obviously used as a people's court.\n Exhibits such as court books, canes, tyres and the like was seized.  According to information and evidence at our disposal, the local community leader of Crossroads the so-called Mayor of Crossroads Johnson Ngxobongwana was in charge of the people's court.\n I remember leaving the court house and proceeded to Johnson's house.  On arrival at his house, we came upon two men who were building a wall around Ngxobongwana's house.  They were being guarded by Ngxobongwana's henchmen.\n It transpired that the two had been sentenced by the people's court and that they had been sentenced to hard labour at Ngxobongwana's house.  I remember entering Ngxobongwana's house and arresting him.\n When arresting him, I found him in possession of a star, 9 mm pistol bearing military markings.  Ngxobongwana was not in possession of a licence for the firearm, and he was unable to produce any authorization to possess the firearm.\n A case of sedition and unlawful possession of a firearm was registered against Ngxobongwana.  I must emphasise  that I was in overall command of the task team, that I did not personally investigate dockets.  Case dockets were assigned to members under my authority.",

            "I apologise.  The case docket of sedition was investigated under cover of Gululetu CR 191/7/86 and was intrusted to Detective Warrant Officer Jooste.\n Johnson Ngxobongwana was not the only arrestee charged, others charged were Moster Nongiaza, William Nyiala, Tandile Mafyaya and Zimaza Mininzi.\n I have managed in the archives at Guguletu to trace SAP register 256, this is a register of cases received by a detective unit and that entry 2786 reflects that the case docket was opened and that it was withdrawn on the 13-05-1087.  The actual case docket has been destroyed.\n No reference to a charge of possession of firearm is recorded, I have also discussed Ngxobongwana's arrest with Captain Jooste who concurs with the circumstances of the arrest which took place on the 21-07-1986.\n He however, cannot recall the firearm incident.  I however, have such a recall.  Captain Jooste is also able to recall the arresting Ngxobongwana was released on R50-00 bail after we had opposed the granting of bail during the morning of his first court appearance.\n I remember that following Ngxobongwana's arrest which was regarded as a major breakthrough, that his arrest was reported to the then Divisional Criminal Investigations Officer, Brigadier Van der Westhuizen whose retired from the police force as a Lieutenant General.\n He was enthusiastic about the arrest.  Either the morning of the arrest or the following day, I accompanied Warrant Officer Jooste to Wynberg Magistrate's court where bail was opposed.\n I remember that Ngxobongwana was represented by an Attorney, Mr Brian Latslow.  I clearly remember feeling rather elated with our success.  This feeling of elation was however shortlived because during the early afternoon of the same day that Ngxobongwana appeared in court, I received a telephone call from an agitated Brigadier Van der Westhuizen.\n I obviously no longer can remember the exact conversation between the Brigadier and myself, but the impression was that he had been severely rebuked because of our actions against Mr Ngxobongwana.\n And that he had been instructed by either the State President or Minister to see to it that Ngxobongwana was released on bail.\n I was informed that the authorities were fully conversant with Ngxobongwana's court, that it was not a people's court, but a tribal court.  I was instructed to immediately see to it that Ngxobongwana was released on bail.\n I phoned the State Prosecutor at Wynberg's Magistrate court and related the instructions which I had received from Brigadier Van der Westhuizen to him.\n Later that same afternoon Ngxobongwana was brought before court and released on R50-00 bail.  I was at Guguletu but for a few months between June and August 1986.  During my time at Guguletu I tried to please evenhandedly against all wrongdoers, irrespective of where their political sympathies were.\n It was however difficult to maintain this policy as it was clear that the Security Police and especially a Captain Flip du Toit, carried a torch for vigilante leaders in Crossroads.\n It also appeared that I was not acceptable to my superiors as I was transferred to Sea Point on the 01-09-1986.  Captain Du Toit was to my knowledge always aware of actions which we took.  He was at Guguletu on a daily basis and we were required to furnished him with details of our investigations.\n While I was at the unit, he never supplied us with any information which was of any value.  During the period of time I served at Guguletu, I held the rank of Captain.  I was transferred to Guguletu from the Murder and Robbery Unit following unhappiness already expressed to this Commission, resulting from the Guguletu-7  incident.",

It is a long report, but it says clearly something that any police person, any police person let alone one who was in charge of an area in which this specific instances had taken place, would have been quite concerned about.\n For instance it says the discrepancies between official and independent accounts of what has been happening, are so striking that the need for clarity can no longer be denied.  If President Botha has any respect for the intelligence of the public he claims to serve, he will immediately appoint a commission.\n Wholly irreconcilable versions which were barred from the public are specific allegations that the police had been siding with the \"witdoek\" vigilantes against the comrades and Crossroads refugees in the (indistinct)\n This from on the spot clergymen and others who have been named in newspaper reports and affidavits.  And a general denial of these allegations maintaining that the police have been impartially holding the line between the warring groups, this from the police.\n It goes on to say that in this week's disgraceful events those are the words of that paper, and not mine, in this week's disgraceful events for example the following statements have been made by reliable witnesses.\n The Reverend John Freeth, this is what he is reported to be saying.  We saw police covering the \"witdoeke\" and firing on the defending shacks.  The Reverend John Freeth, it was very clear that the \"witdoeke\" were operating under police protection.\n The Reverend David Cook right in front of us there were three caspers.  No attempt was made to stop the looting, the burning and the fighting.  I saw a policeman shooting with a rifle into KTC defenders to prevent them from defending their property.\n Father Desmond Currin, St Gabriels, this very church, Guguletu and Mrs Emma Huysmans, editor of Crisis News said that police vans and a casper escorted the vigilantes on their way to attack the Zwolani Centre every step of the way.  The Centre had been housing Crossroads refugees and was destroyed by fire and attack.\n The police will reply, they issued blanket denials.  Either these respected eye-witnesses are deluded or shameless liars.  Or else, police spokesman do not have all the facts to their disposal.
