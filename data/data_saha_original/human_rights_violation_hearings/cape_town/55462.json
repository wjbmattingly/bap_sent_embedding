Now tension arose due to the fact that these people had collected money for bail, and there was something else for which they had collected money but I can't recall exactly what it was, so it was an issue of community involvement and I think the United Democratic Front was very much to the fore in that.  Some people then said no, we mustn't give money for bail and others said yes we should, and this led to division and conflict between the people.

That meant that there was a great influx of people from the - residents from the Transkei, Ciskei to Crossroads.  Crossroads was over-populated, it was crowded, people in both Mr Ngxobongwana and Mr Yamile's group, they attached themselves to these satellite groups.\n During the announcement that Crossroads would not be done away with, and that it in fact would be upgraded there was an excitement which took hold amongst the people and this related to who would be included in the upgrading process.  In other words Mr Yamile, who was a leader of quite a large group and Mr Ngxobongwana was also a leader on the other side had a large group of followers, conflict arose between those two groups as to who should be included in the upgrading.  Ngxobongwana's followers believed that it should be them because they believed it was their area, and Mr Yamile on the other hand I believe he also felt that he had the right to be included in the upgrading, and that led to tension between the two groups.\n Then of course the second situation or reason was a political one.  Violence was an issue in those days and there had been attacks in Crossroads launched from outside.  I hope I have answered the question now.",
