The military did it on their levels, so it was sensible to the recipients, General Malan, and he supported it.

And then you go on to tell us now that you never saw police supporting the Witdoeke.  Now what is the value of that statement that you are putting on record?  \n You never saw the police support, actively supporting the Witdoeke and yet we have heard numerous accounts, people who are respectable citizens in this country, and not only that we've got video footage clearly demonstrating the support and backing of Witdoeke by police.  And then you come to tell us now in your testimony that you never saw police - what is the value of that statement?",

It is alleged that the police, the security forces and maybe some of the people involved in development administration practised their own brand of rape, and I'm calling it a brand of rape because it's not rape in the true sense.  It is alleged throughout the country and in this case in this area that is subject to our discussion, that these people took advantage of the fears experienced by women, took advantage by establishing some liaison, sexual liaison where they regularly had, I don't want to call them girlfriends, but regular points of sexual satisfaction, that people had nowhere to go, targeting women who were too afraid to say no because they knew what would happen to them.  That in fact some of these men fathered children.

Because one of the aims of the Commission is to make a recommendation to the powers that be that must ensure that such incidents should never happen.
