            "Thank you. In 1986 I was a worker at Epping at Murray & Roberts. On that Monday I was not at work, I had gone to the X-ray check at Groote Schuur. Then from the hospital I went to the terminus. When I got to the terminus I heard that the Witdoeke were there.  I had heard the previous day that the Witdoeke would come (indistinct). So I went from the terminus I went straight home.  When I got home I noticed that there was some fire and my grandmother and an uncle and my aunts, they were not there.  Their houses were there, but they were not there. The kids were there. So when I found my people at home, the people were busy taking their belongings away to New Crossroads, and I helped.  I went for the first trip and we dismantled the houses and the others were already on fire.  I loaded the household goods, my uncle, my father and other people from 7 took the other trip, went to the second trip.  On the second trip the car was full and there was no space for me. So I was going, I remained, I was going to walk on foot.  As I was walking, there was some angry shouts, the Witdoeke are there and they already are in site KTC and we ran with a number of comrades who were there and we went towards KTC, next to the (indistinct), to stop at (indistinct).  There were two Hippos. They came very close to me.  So I decided I am not going to run away, because they have come to stop this.  So I stopped running and then I just walked.  And then there was a tap and then I went to the tap to drink some water.\n And then I noticed there was a Hippo that was open. I noticed that this Hippo was full of Witdoeke, who disembarked and they came directly to me.  So I didn't go out of KTC. I went back and then they were shooting some things at the shacks to ignite them, fire.  And as I was running the shacks surrounded me were burning, so I had to go back to them, so that if I could escape I could escape amongst them. But I tried and tried but it was all in vain.   And the person who shot me was a white man who was inside the Hippo, he shot me here. I fell and when I fell it was for a couple of seconds and then I woke up and then I ran and then I was hacked and brought down by axes.  Then they came and hacked me and they left me for dead, because when I fell, I fell on my back.  As they were coming, one of them hit me with a sabre on my head, and then I turned and slept on my stomach and then they started hacking me and they thought I was dead.\n So when I heard that there was no more noise and there was, I was no more dizzy I lifted my head and then I looked at the time.  I found it was 20 past two.  So I decided to get up. Then I did, I got up.  When I got up I walked three steps, then I heard another whistle.  Then they said there is that dog, he is still living. This old gentleman came back and to hack me again.  Whilst they were hacking me, it so happened that in their Hippo there was a young man who knew me, who stayed in my area, who had been taken in.  So when they came for me, they left him untied and he came and he lifted me and he ran away with me.  I said don't leave me, these people, just leave me, these people are coming and there are two Hippos, they are going to injure us, you had better leave me and Tom said no, I am not going to leave you, I am going to run with you.  \n And then there was a car.  I said stop the car, that's my uncle, it is one of the cars we are using to cart the household things from there.  So the car stopped and they gave me a lift, but my uncle didn't recognise, he thought he was just helping someone. When we got to my house, my mother was standing on the door step and asked for me.  Because - and no one answered him. And then I answered from the car and asked for water and I wanted for a pillow, because I was bleeding profusely now. Then I was supported by a pillow and they put in a pillow and they gave me the water. And then when they noticed, they said, one little girl said no, there is Sigwela. Then my mother came and my father came and then they were crying, and they said is it you?  I said yes, I have been shot whilst I was drinking water.  \n My uncle started the car, took me to the day hospital. I was alert mentally, so I registered that bleeding. Then an ambulance was phoned and the ambulance took me to Groote Schuur.  At the Groote Schuur Hospital I was admitted, they took me to the theatre for an operation. I think I came to at about 20 to nine. I was in a ward, lying on my back.  But when I tried to speak I couldn't.  There was some thing that I was using for breathing.  Then my father and my uncle and my aunts came, but I couldn't answer them, but I could recognise them.  They were asked not to talk to me because I was having a breath, and I was in a coma for two weeks. I wasn't speaking. \n The third week I was transferred to Conradie. There I spent a week.  After a week at Conradie I was taken to the theatre for removal of the bullets on the 24th.  They took out the bullets,and then they took me back to the ICU for a month at ICU. I was then taken - my health retrogressed because I have got some cloth inside and then they will try and drained this cloth.  They drained those cloths and then I got better.  And then I was taken to a general ward, taken out of ICU, where I stayed for six months.  This is at Conradie.  I think I was discharged on the 4th of December, that same year, 1986, and then they took me home.  \n At home I stayed 1986, 1987, went to Conradie, because of some problems I used to have and I got a wheelchair.  Then I would get for workshop. I still go for my check-ups to Conradie as I am sitting here.  \n At the same time what happened, I was the breadwinner\nat home, because my father had lost his job at Goodwood.  My mother was not very well. My brothers were dependent on me, they were starting outside, depending on me.  So I was the supporter of the family for everything. They depended on me for everything. So after that when I got injured, things changed for the bad for my family and things got worse and worse at home.  There was no progress in terms of help for food and it is still like that, until now.  My parents at the moment depend on my grant and my mother's health grant, but everything is dependent on us, up to now, 1997.",

There was also some targeting of the councillors and I did hear that anyone who burns my house should expect that his house will also be burnt, because I told those people, saying that I would also go and buy their homes, because my father was never a councillor.

When that money came I was in hospital, then I was found the money from the lawyers in August, to tell me how much they gave me.  They gave me an amount of 15 000.",

So I told them I wasn't going to pay a cent for that. So they still send those accounts. I just ignore them.   I told them that I don't have money, because the cent that I got from the grant is just enough for me to buy clothes for myself.  The hospital doesn't help me. I have to hire a car to go to the hospital to go back home, even the watch that I have I must buy myself.

            "Thank you. Thank you, Chairperson. I can start this way. As a resident at Crossroads, from 1974, and we moved in 1982, if I am not mistaken, to New Crossroads. As we had some leaders who was Mr Nongwasi and Mr Memani.  When we moved from the stand there was already some conflict which caused people to stay away from their houses.  So much so that that was the reason why if I do not move from Crossroads to the brick-built houses I may lose my life, because I was with linked with a committee with Mr Mbongwane which prevented people from going to the brick-built houses. Even when the first batch of residents to these houses and they were paying for water, I felt that if I didn't move from the shack it would be risky for my life.  Because it was clear that we are not forced to pay for water.  Because the houses at Crossroads were asked for by us and therefore we didn't think we should pay.  And then we were moved to New Crossroads and then we got to New Crossroads, as parents we were split into two groups.  There were some who were still loyal to Mr Mbongwane and that's where the conflict   and division started.   There were people who were saying we can't be loyal to Mbongwane any more, we must start afresh because we are in brick-built houses.  Therefore we can't be loyal to those old instructions, and that is where the conflict started amongst the people who lived in New Crossroads.  In 1983 when some people died, about eight or seven, if I am not mistaken, because of this conflict.\n I am going to leave that.  And then came this time for parents versus their children.  And then it was reported that parents were attacking the kids or the kids attacking the parents.  So went the rumour. \n But it was clear, when you explained as a parent that you didn't support UDF, you were taken by the youth and some parents who were members of the youth, that you were a supporter of Mbongwane.  It was not easy to support Mbongwane and not support it, and then I was confused at that stage because I didn't know which side I was to be on. The first patrol when we were taken out of our houses.  Unfortunately I was not there. I had come back late from work and until the weekend, and then I was off during the weekend. I was forced there to be present in a patrol as a resident, because if you didn't join the patrol, you were identified as supporting a particular side.  At that time UDF was represented in all, it combined all the townships in the Western Cape.  There was no exception.  Indeed, kids would come from all directions. What I noticed was that even here at New Crossroads, there is a committee which belonged to Mbongwane. So when I noticed the fights and I raised this with the parents, I asked how they felt towards this and some parents no, it is the kids.  And so I was affected that because lots of men died in that fight, because they were being taken from the hospital as if they were being discharged, only to find that they were being brought back to be killed. I noticed that all the people who were committee members, they were not there.  You would see just one when there was a break in the fighting.  Indeed, a person who from the government was affected, I think Rev Mfenyana did mention this.  When I left - the police, when the police left with this man, I asked is it true what this white person is saying.  No one answered me.",

At that time the roads at KTC were closed to the house, and when these kids were chased, they would run into the shacks and then it would be easy for their fathers to be injured.   And then they would come out and then disappear into the shacks at KTC.  It was not easy for other parents to attack other parents' houses. That is when we as parents got injured. And then I said this is not right.\n So much so, I faced Mgoba who was a big committee member of Mr Mbongwane, who used to - and like my son said, there was a rumour that I was a councillor.  I asked this neighbour of mine how do you say we should join a fight, but you are not there.  And then he said no, we are going to fetch support from Crossroads.  I said how can you go to Crossroads, but you are chasing the kids, but you are not here.  But we don't know what is the reason, and it is clear that the fight is between you and the kids.  So why don't you explain to us what you are fighting about with these children so that we should know what the reason is.  And apparently this was too difficult a question for him. So we clashed and then I withdrew, because he is the one who spread the rumour that I was a member of the council.  So I decided to withdraw, because he was not answering me. \n So he left, because, saying that he was going to call people.  When he left I got a chance to say to other people. I say people, maybe people should kill me in my house.  Because I can't take part in this fight, because I don't know what the reason is, I never had a quarrel with these people.",
