            "On the 3rd of July in 1986, I was befell by this tragedy with my son.  There was a place they used to go for their meetings.  There was their camp at a place called Shangaan Hill.  That was their usual place to meet. He'd been to this hill for quite a few times and at times we would even go to bed without seeing him at all and he would come the next morning. They would leave in the morning and at times they would leave in the evening and we would see him the next day.  He was involved in this struggle.\n The police used to come to my house almost every day, we couldn't sleep peacefully. It was one o'clock in the evening when the police came and they kicked the doors and we would open the doors and they would search for my child.  One day they picked him up and they took him to the cells and they would come in, they would shout, they would insult us. They took the boy with them and they put him into the cells and it was quite a time that I didn't know what happened to my son and I said to myself one day, I haven't seen my son for a week, what happened to him? What am I going to say if the police come to me, if they tell me that I should appear before the court of law?\n Things were just quiet, I was never called,I didn't know that my son was arrested.  Time went by and I heard from rumours that my son was moving in police vans and I was shocked and said, \"My son in police vans?\"  They said, \"Yes\".  Other people were sympathising with me and every time I would walk in the streets, people would be pointing their fingers at me, and seeing that I didn't know anything I'll be surprised. Those who were brave enough \ncame to me and they said to me, \"We've that your house is NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 MNISI\ngoing to be burned together with your mother's as well as your sister's, and I said to them, why, what have we done, because we don't know anything?\n And I was now told that they want to kill him. On Wednesday my child came home, it was in the evening. I woke up on Thursday morning and I talked to my son. I said to him, \"Lucky, what is it that you are doing because now my house is going to be burned, what have you done? Please leave this struggle, come back home, stay at home.  And Lucky, I'm asking you not to move around the streets because even if I walk around the streets, people point fingers at me, I don't know what I have done\". \n It was a Thursday and I went to the women's church gathering and I said to him, \"Please, do not leave today, you are now being chased and I've heard that you are going to be killed, please stay here at home.  I put on my church attire and I went to church.  On my way I came back just before reaching the church.  I said, \"Lucky please I want you to stay here, don't go!\" , and I went to church.\n When you are inside the church you can still see my house.  I saw him moving out of the gate.  We prayed in the church and at half past four I went back home.  I said, \"Where is Lucky?\".  They said to me, Luck is not here at home\". I stayed till it was time for bed and he wasn't in the house.  The next morning on Friday, my sister arrived. This one sitting next to me and she said to me, Lucky has passed away. He was burned to death.\n I asked her what happened? Who burned him? We started crying.",

My sister said to me, \"Please do not cry!\"  I said to her, \"No I won't\".  My sister was there with my husband and they said,\" Can you please open so that we can see whether it's my son?\"  I turned him and I looked at him, he was stabbed 18 holes, I was brave enough to count those holes, and my sister wanted to pull me from counting them.  I said to her, \"Please stop it, I want to see him\".  My son was burned.\nHe was my first born and I was looking to him, he was my future.",

I think you have reminded the community again and reminded us that one of the saddest things about the whole struggle were the divisions between family and family and neighbour an neighbour and son and mother and people taking different sides.  So it sounds to me as though what you're saying to us is that your son was one of the comrades, was arrested, assaulted and in the hope of being freed and having the assault being stopped, that he offered to assist and joined different sides and then people act against that.  Nothing of this is right, no one has the right to go and kill people and have 18 wounds and to burn a person. But the whole struggle led to enormous divisions. I hope that if those divisions are still there, if the community is still divided, that after ten years, we will learn to come to terms with these, we don't understand everything, we cannot explain everything, but perhaps through this Commission, through the telling of your story and so many other stories we've heard, that there will come healing not only for yourself, for your sister, but also for the community, so that people can live in peace.\nNELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n10 MNISI\nThat is my hope for you and for your community and I want to thank you very much indeed for coming and telling us your story.
