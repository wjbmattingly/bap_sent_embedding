<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> Elizabeth, I will help you as you have just given us the written statement.  Can you tell us in short the type of life you were living during the time of the 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> During the year 1986 I was still a scholar then.  If I remember well I was doing standard 7.  The place where I come from my family I grew up in a Christian environment but through schooling you normally do whatever is being done at school.   During the year 1986, it was the year where it was not possible to attend school.  At school we normally experienced the visit of the police.  Even if we were just seated and we were prepared to learn you could find us scattered outside because of the tear-gas which was thrown to us.  I remember the other day as we were busy attending classes, teachers were also present, we saw a tear-gas coming in through a window and that caused that we should move outside and we did not know actually to which direction should we move to.  And there was sort of - we were told that we should go to Gabogweni magistrate offices because some of the pupils were arrested and we went to the Gabogweni magistrate offices.  There were buses made available at school.  There came our seniors.  Some actually had sjamboks with them and then they said to us all of us should board the bus and we followed that direction.  We</p>

<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>2 MDLULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>went to Gabogweni.  When we arrived at Gabogweni we were so many.  We found that there were many buses and we followed the rest.  On our arrival there people were actually singing the freedom songs.  I was standing there looking at the people.  As I was looking there up front it was my first time to see such a big gun.  I was actually shocked when I saw policemen with guns.  I said to myself no I better go back home or rather go back to the bus because I was afraid then.  I went back to the bus.  Because the buses were just across the road, as I was about to go through on my way to the bus I heard a gunshot.  I was very much shocked.  I nearly fell down.  I stopped a bit to breathe and I ran.  I did not look at the back.  As I was running forward I heard something at the back of my head as if something is burning me.  I felt as if I could fall and roll and I had a bit of saliva in my mouth.  When I spit it out it was blood outside.  I only heard that people were running and then I said to my friends better help me and another brother of mine helped me.  Another boy helped me.  He took me.  As we came to the road he said to me well things are bad here.  Can you see the security forces here and I said no I can't see them. Then he said to me open your eyes, you will see there are a lot of policemen here and I only looked just one look.  Then I said to the boy well leave me and then run away.  Then he said to me I will never leave you behind.  Then I said no we will die being two, it is better that you leave me alone and then he said to me do you know me, I said well I can hear your voice.  He said who are you.  Then he said to me I am mechanic (?).  In other words this boy is actually of Mdluli surname.  We are not related.  It is just because we know one another.  And then I said to him leave</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>3 MDLULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>me behind even though things are bad, just go and inform them at home that I am injured.  They will come and check me at the hospital.  If they don't find me there they will check wherever they can.   If ever I die well I will die with you.  When we reached the road and then there was another vehicle which stood across.  At that time taxis could not stop, even cars could not stop, people were afraid and school pupils actually realised that many of us were injured and they were forcing a person driving a vehicle that he should actually give us a lift.  And he took us to the hospital.  The person actually who helped me in the registration at the hospital was this very same boy.  I can remember very vividly when we were taken to the X-ray.  After the X-ray they took me to the theatre.  I woke up while I was sleeping at the ward.  At the ward I found here at me there was a pipe which was put inside.  It was draining the blood out of my body and yet on the other side there were drips.  I was there at the ward, many things actually what happened there, principals and other students also came to pay us a visit there.  During that time I can't remember very well other people came with navy blue clothes and they had maroon epaulettes on them.  And they were going around you know, going around to the beds and the patients.  They came to me where I was actually sleeping and they checked me and they said to me police are here and the police are here in this very floor and they are busy taking statements.  I don't know what happened and thereafter another message came through that these police are back again, they want to arrest us right from the wards and take us away from the hospital.  I did not see them, I only heard that it was Dr Throater (?) actually who was actually in</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>4 MDLULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>charge of the hospital then.  Then he said to them no he doesn't have comrades here, he has got only patients there.  He cannot allow that police - that people should come and arrest patients here before they can be released.  All that was actually heard from the sisters who were working in that ward.  Then I saw the principal.  What made me feel sorry, I did not know actually that I was sick, I only knew that I was just injured.  And principal came to see me at the hospital together with the students.  But when the principal came there he could not look at face to face and when he was looking at me he could face the other direction and start crying.  Then I had to ask myself what is happening now.  He could not afford to sit for a longer period here but the principal for him it was too difficult to sit there and talk to me.  But what worries me and what actually made me feel painful it is because I am not a member of any organisation and I am not actually a person who is affiliated to any movement but today I am crippled because it is just I was found at school, that was my sin.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> I am just going to request you to explain further to us as to what happened.  We have heard that you are heartbroken because you are now crippled and you were not born like that.  If I have to take you back just a little you said earlier on at your school police were continually coming.  Can you tell us briefly what time were the police arriving at your school and when you were given an explanation at school what were they saying.  That is the teachers.  Why were the policemen coming to your school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> At that time it was the beginning of the year.  We were only told at assembly that there are students that have been arrested because you know there was just violence</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>5 MDLULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>but now we got angry because in one school a child had died and we wanted to support that school and that led to unrest in the school.  Here in our school there were also students that were arrested at Gabogweni and we had to attend their court hearing.  The aim was actually to go and support the case at Gabogweni magistrates court and when we arrived there we found the police.  They would come at school.  I can't speak on behalf of the school kids but as I see the police would come and just their presence would make these school kids feel very uneasy.  They would throw tear-gases into the school yard and you would never carry on learning in that kind of a situation.  We would have to disperse.  MRS MKHIZE:  You have just said that you were doing standard 7 at that time.  How old were you then?  What were your ages when you met this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> If I am not mistaken I was 18 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> How old are you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> I am 28 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> Just briefly tell us, because you have just said that you don't know the Mdluli but you said Mdluli helped you at the time you have been beaten up and he took you to the hospital.  And you said you are not feeling well.  Now tell us what did the doctor discover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> There was an X-ray report on my bed.  Now the X-ray showed that I had bullet holes.  Here on the stomach.  But the thing that really destroyed me a lot was a bullet that hit me behind my head and I lost my balance and on my body as well.  I couldn't see at first that I was shot at the body, I only saw the X-ray reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> Are there other parts of your body that are not functioning very well, because you have just said that you</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>6 MDLULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>are a bit crippled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  As now I have a problem with my chest.  At the back I am always tired.  I have a problem with my bladder.  I am sickly at all times, I have a pain that keeps on haunting me every day.  There are times when I urinate I urinate blood.  I was fit I have to tell you, I was an athlete at school.  I wish I could remain lying every time because if i stand and try to work I get tired quickly.  I cannot lift up heavy objects.  And my mind, my mental state is unstable.  At times I just stop thinking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> When you were released from the hospital did you go back to school to carry on with your studies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> Yes, I went back to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> I am trying to get clarity here because you have just mentioned that you were mentally disturbed but now when you went back to school were you disturbed in any other way by the accident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> Yes, I went back to school, things were normal at the beginning but I didn't notice this problem immediately when I was discharged from the hospital but as time went on I realised that it seems as if I am a bit insane but I do not know now because I don't have problems.  I am just living like any other person but I think this mental state comes from the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MKHIZE:</span> Thank you very much.  I want to take you back now to Mr Chairperson so that other Commissioners may ask you questions as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SOOKA:</span> Elizabeth, immediately after you came out of hospital did your parents or did you see any attorney, any lawyer to ask them to check about who actually shot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> No.  What happened they did not take any</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>NELSPRUIT TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>7 MDLULI</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>further steps about this matter.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SOOKA:</span> Did you ever receive any kind of compensation by the police or any other person for what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> No, I did not receive anything.  I was shot at and that was the end of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SOOKA:</span> Could you tell us what work you actually do now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS MDLULI:</span> I am working at Villa Italia, I am a chef.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SOOKA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">COMMISSIONER:</span> Elizabeth, we were saying that the youth did actually contribute a lot to the freedom and to the liberation and we realise the fact that even though people actually - and you were just walking back to the buses and now that you happened to be about your explanation the police were actually giving you problems.  But now I want to say this to you, that actually they paid the price.  Actually the young people like those, like you, actually helped a lot, contributed a lot.  I look at you as if you are still 18 years of age.  We want to thank you because you did work, you worked for the nation.   (Indistinct) Mkhize here he is actually a member of the Reparation and Rehabilitation and he asked a lot of questions to you that how do you feel now.  Maybe he is trying to find out from you something that could sort of help you.  By the time when the Commission ends its work in 1998/1999 maybe they could refer you to some of the doctors who can sort of help you in order to assist you healthwise.  But we want to thank you.</p>
