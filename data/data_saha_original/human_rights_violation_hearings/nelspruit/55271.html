<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We welcome you, Mr Solomon.  I would ask Commissioner Malan to help you as you take your oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">SOLOMON BOY KHOZA:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you.  We will ask the Commissioner here to help you so that you put your testimony forward.  Yasmin Sooka will help you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Mr Khoza, don't be nervous.  Do you want to tell us what happened to you on the eve of Chris Hani's funeral.  Speak loudly, please, so that everybody can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> We were sitting on the road. We had made a fire and policemen came.  They told us not to do any damage and afterwards a 4 X 4 came and it was driven by a white man.  When he came there he stopped, he took his gun and he fired. I stood up. He shot me, he hit me. I fell down.  I tried to run.  I ran to one house and one woman in that house tried to help me.  They took me to hospital. When I was in hospital I don't know what happened.  I was admitted and stayed in hospital for four months.  I went back to Barberton.  After I was discharged from hospital I could not eat certain foods like stiff porridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you for telling us that.  But I am going to ask you a few questions, just to make sure that we get your story right. Do you want to tell me where you actually</p>

<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>stay and what you did at that time for a living.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I am living in Barberton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Are you employed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I am not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> At the time that you were shot, were you employed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, I was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What were you actually doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> At the Sowetan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you a reporter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I wasn't a reporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Where were you going on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> We were going to a night vigil, Chris Hani's night vigil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you going there by bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, by bus, we were waiting for the bus.  This happened while we were waiting for the bus at the station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> How many of you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I couldn't tell, because we were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So while you were waiting at the station for the bus to come, this is when this 4 X 4 came and you were then shot. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So in how many places were you shot on your body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Two places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Tell us where that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> One on my left rib and on my right rib.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Since you have come out of hospital, when you came out of hospital, did you make a statement to the police about what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I tried to go to the police station, but they NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>3 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>couldn't do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Why, didn't they want to open a charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> It all ended up nowhere.  They did, but it ended up nowhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did they actually open a docket, did they take a statement from you and did they press charges against this man who shot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, they tried to press charges against this man. They have taken a statement.  The first time it was when I was in hospital.  I couldn't talk very well at that time.  Again, I can't sit for a long time.  We went to court and then the case was remanded, remanded many times.  Up until it just ended like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did they withdraw charges against this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did you have a lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So you did not press a civil claim against this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> To claim you need money, I didn't have money to employ a lawyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What effect has the shooting had on your life now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I am not crippled and I can't work.  I can't do anything, I am just no one.  I tried to go for a pension.  They told me I am still young, I don't qualify for a pension.  Now I am with my brother. He cannot afford looking after me because he is also married and has a wife.  Also, he is taking care of my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were there other people who were shot in the same incident, by the same man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>4 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I was the only one shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> When you say that you are crippled, can you tell us a little bit more about that, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I can't live heavy things, anything that is heavy I can't lift up. I was working somewhere and they couldn't take me any more because I used to ask for days off to go for medical check-ups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> In your statement you also say that you don't remember so well.  Do you want to tell us a little bit about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Usually when I am doing things I forget. Even when someone asks me to do something, I forget. I even forget what I was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Have you received any treatment for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, my brother gives me money to go for check-ups.  Lots of time I have pains I do go to doctors for treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Where do you get the pains? Do you get the pains in your body or do you get headaches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Where I was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And they give you tablets at the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, they do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You are not married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I am not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Do you have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I have one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> How do you support yourself and the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> My brother is supporting me. I can't support myself and he is also taking care of my child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What do you want the Truth Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>5 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I can't tell, I think the Truth Commission will see what they can do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> How old are you, incidentally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I was born in 1966.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> I asked you if you were a reporter and you said no, so what work were you doing for the Sowetan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> We were delivering newspapers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And you lost your job then obviously, at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, Mr Khoza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you very much, Mr Khoza. I will ask other Commissioners to help you and if they have some questions to ask.  Wynand Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Khoza, did you never go to the police to make a statement and lay a charge against Mr Richards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Witnesses went to the police station and laid a charge, not me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but you were the person shot. Did you never make a statement?  Did you never make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why didn't you go to the police and ask them to prosecute Mr Richards and bring him to book?  Because that is what you now ask of the Truth Commission, but that should be asked of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> They arrested Mr Richards, because witnesses went to the police station and made a statement against Mr Richards.  The case was being remanded from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> They never took a statement from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Khoza, can you please also explain the</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>6 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>circumstances to me.  You say that before Mr Richards stopped there, where you were waiting for the bus, there was another vehicle from protective services that stopped and told you not to be violent and then drove off.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, that car came first and they told us that we must not damage anything.  Then after that car, the police car left, then the 4 X 4 came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And was Mr Richards alone in his car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In his 4 X 4.  How many people were there waiting for the bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> We were many. It is difficult for me to estimate how many actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And are you saying Mr Richards came with a 4 X 4. He stopped, came to a halt, next to the group around the fire and then you say this Mr Richards or Jombenleni, as you knew him, he got out of the car and then he fell down?  Is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did he fall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> He was drunk.  I thought he was drunk. So I just couldn't pay much attention to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you think he stopped there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I can't tell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did nobody in the group get in his way and stop the 4 X 4, did they not block his way perhaps?  Did you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, no one. He stopped his car himself. We didn't even try to stop his car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When he first got out and he fell down, did he</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>7 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>have his gun with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, he had his gun with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So he stopped, he fell down.  Then he got up and then he took his gun and then he fired the first shot?  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> He stopped and then he came out of his car.  He fell and then he took his gun and he fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And he fired all the shots at you?  The only shots he fired, he fired at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> The first time he shot in the air. The second time I was sitting down, so I stood up, I tried to run and that is when he started shooting at me. I went to one house. I tried to get some help. One woman tried to help me, until I was taken to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I will tell you why I am asking these questions, because we need to find a context.  The Truth Commission deals with conflict within the political framework. Now the only reference that is political in this, seems to be the fact that a group of you were waiting for a bus to go to the vigil for Chris Hani.  Suddenly somebody pitches and he starts shooting.  But there is no indication that he has a political motive.  What is the political record of this Mr Richards?  Can you tell us?  Do you think he had a political motive or do you think he had some revenge ideas, looking for you or do you think he was simply drunk? How do we assess this within the framework of the political conflict?  I am sorry that I am making your life so difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Actually I can't tell really, except that he is a boer.  He owns a farm.  If he belongs to any political organisation that one, I don't know and I can't tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>I can't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>8 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> We will certainly see what more we can find out, whether we can bring it within the context.  But from my side for the moment, thank you very much.  Back to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> While you are still there I would like to notify other members here that a bus will leave here to the Promenade Hotel and another bus will leave here to Gangamasani.  We will also ask Commissioners to help you so that you verify your testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You have just said now that he was a farmer.  But in your statement you also say that he was well-known and that his nickname was Yambeleni. Just tell us what that means and why he was given that name and did you know him before this thing happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I don't know how to explain this.  I don't know how to explain this very well, except that he owned a farm and he used to kick doors when he was going to his workers' houses.  His real name is Richard. This Yambeleni is just his nickname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What does Yambeleni mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I don't know how to put this in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Order, order, please.  We want you to explain to the Commission why he was called Yambeleni.  Because when you say you don't know, it is difficult for us, for the Commission to understand what Yambeleni really means.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> I can't tell you why he was called Yambeleni.  Because when I grew up I found him being called Yambeleni. Why he was called Yambeleni I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Order, order, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did he know you before he shot at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> No, I don't know.</p>

<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>9 MR S B KHOZA</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> But you knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, I used to know him, I used to know him. He was driving around in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So everybody in the location knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHOZA:</span> Yes, they knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you, Mr Khoza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We want to thank you. If I may ask you a question. Just a little question.
