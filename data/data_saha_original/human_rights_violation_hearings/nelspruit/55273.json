            "1990, July they shot my son at Matsolo. He was from the shop, from Mayola Shop.  When he was shot he never died instantly.  Some people ran to call Dr Mabusa and he was then removed to Ungondini Hospital.  He was shot on the 27th of that month. On the 28th he died.  I was working during that time. As I was going around, searching for him I could not find him. Then I heard by rumour that someone has been shot and he is unknown. Then we went to Dr Mabuso to check.  The person working there said no, they are alive and is promising that well, those that have been shot, are alive. Then they told another person who was accompanying me that they should not inform me. He did not tell me.  Then we\nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n2 LUBISI\nwent back home. As I was entering my house and then I said to my mother well, my son is alive, it is promising. As I was walking out of my house then the person who was accompanying me told my mother that well, the boy has passed away. Then they said I should not inform him because otherwise I could not be able to take him.\n The following day we went out together with Conrad Moyi. On our way we requested a vehicle from Mr Mayole who went to Ungondini Hospital. On our arrival there we had to ask.  Then they said to us we should wait for one moment.  Then from there we were given a nurse who led us to the mortuary.  They opened there and then he was found there. He was found inside in the mortuary.  I only looked once and I could not, and I fell there.  From there I sat outside and from there they said to us now that he has been found, go back home, we will remove him and take him to Nelspruit mortuary. They need to do post-mortem on him on Wednesday. Then we went back home.\n When we were at home the following day, on Wednesday, we went to the police station.  I was together with my sister who is also present here. They took us to Nelspruit. On our arrival there at Nelspruit we waited at the mortuary. As we were sitting there they called us.  They said to us the one who is brave should come in.  Then we said well, we can come in.  As we entered the mortuary and they were just pulling him from - I looked at once and I fainted there. They took me out.  From there then the funeral was then over.  Then I wanted to find out, those people actually who shot him, should come and see me. No, they don't come. \n Up to now nothing has happened. Now up to now\nnothing has happened. Now all the time if this boy was born \nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 LUBISI\nin 1973, June.  Then I heard there will be a Truth Commission which could perhaps assist.  Then they gave me the direction.\n So this is the reason - then I went to give my statement to the people.",
