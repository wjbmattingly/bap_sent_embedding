One day Mr Mpanga - it was in NELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n2 MS N B MTSHALI\nNovember - we were not at home, we were at work.  I left with my son.  When we came home we could not find him.  When we asked Mr Mpanga said the magistrate sent them to Natal.  When Mr Mpanga came back from Natal he said they took someone there as well.  When he came on Monday he came along, my son was not with him. \n When we asked Mr Mpanga where was my son, Mpanga said when they were at Germiston my son stood up and said he was going back home.  Mr Mpanga said my son went and caught a train. I asked him was he drunk or what. Mr Mpanga said no. When he came back home Mr Mpanga just gave us my son's ID and my son's travelling bag.  \n We went to the police station together with Mr Mpanga. We went and saw Mr Smuts. We told them the whole story.  Mr Smuts said no, Mr Mpanga you must tell us where the boys is, you can't bring us his ID and his bag.  \n They said this story we need to tell the Commissioner.  My husband and myself went to Umbogintwini magistrate.  We told them that you took ur child without our permission and now our child is not coming back home.  He said no, your child is happy in that area there, he will come back.  You go back home and stay there.  We were puzzled about that. Because we expected the Commissioner to ask Mr Mpanga more about my son's disappearance. He told us we must go back and stay.  \n We went back home. His father could not relax. He kept on going up and down to mortuaries, hospitals, he went everywhere.  He spent a lot of time fetching for my son.  He went back home.  We went back to the Umbogintwini magistrate, the Commissioner. We told them that we can't find our son.  \nNELSPRUIT HEARING TRC/MPUMULANGA\n3 MS N B MTSHALI",
