            "IN July 1986 in the afternoon, it was about a quarter to seven. As I was sitting at home with my wife, another woman came and she said to me, \"I'm asking you to leave this place now because your house is going to be burned down today\". And I asked her, what happened. She said, \"I don't know, and she decided to run away.  She said, \"they might get me here\".\n As I was puzzled by what she had just told me my children said, \"Father please run away because you've got the message now.\"  I didn't know what to do, I decided to stay but they said to me, \"please go\" and I left the house. My wife was left behind with the children.\n When they arrived they were in a large number and they asked where I was.  My wife said, I'm not present, and they started shattering the windows and the other one had poured petrol and the other one lit the house.  The house was on fire and everything destroyed. My house was big but it was destroyed, food clothes, furniture, everything. I was left alone as I was together with my children. \n On the same night the police arrived, the soldiers and they arrested two boys. These boys didn't want to cooperate NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n3 MASANGANE\nat all.  The next morning when we woke up, this is not my body, I'm a heavily built man but as you see me now, I was affected since the incident, and what happened because they said they want me, and I don't know, what have I done?  I still swear I don't know what wrong I have done.  And I asked this other boy.  I said, \"Friend, do you know a place where they normally meet, I want them to tell me what happened, why did they burn my house, what have I done? And the boys said, \"At about something to one, we'll come and take you to the place.\"  These were the two boys.\n And when we arrived there we found two boys and we asked them, \"Where are your superiors?\" They said. \"No, they are not here.\"  And they said, \"Are you Mr Masangane whose house had been burned?\" I said, \"Yes, I am Masangane and I'm here to get clarity as to what happened that my house was burned.\" They said, \"You are brave enough to come here, it's true that you are innocent, try by all means.\"  It was on a Wednesday, they said, \"Please try to be at school in the afternoon about seven o'clock, there will be the superiors there and they will give you a clear indication relating to the whole incident\". \n I decided that if I have to die, I'll just have to die because I was already dead without house and furniture and everything.  At seven o'clock I was at the place I was directed to go to, I found two heavily built men, and I asked them, I said, \"I am the person whose house had been burned yesterday, what have I done, what wrong have I done?\" And I said, \"You are the leaders of these children\".  They said, \"Are you the owner?\" I said, \"Yes I am\", and they said to me, \"We heard people talking but we are now surprised as to why was your house burned.  We are really sorry and we NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n4 MASANGANE\nreally sympathise that your house was burned without anything wrong that you have done\".  And they said,\"We don't know how can we help you to rebuild your house\". They said, \"If we had money we would give you to rebuild your house\".   Then I said to them, \"Tell me, what wrong have I done?\"m The first thing that they told me was, \"You are a school committee member\".  And they said, \"You are a favourite man when it comes to the chief\".  And I said, \"Now who elected me to be on the  school board?  Wasn't I elected by the parents?\"  They said, \"Yes, the parents elected you but this was a mistake.  You know, if you are well behaved in the eyes of the chief, he would praise you\".  Now it was a sin to be praised by the chief then and I was told that I should go back home and if the youth comes to trouble me again I should go to the superiors to report the matter.\n On Wednesday the police arrived, Whiteriver policemen.  They wanted to hear the whole story and they said to me, \"Do you know the perpetrators?\"  I said, \"Yes I know them, my wife told me who all was here\". They went to one of them and they arrested him and we went to the court of law.  And in the court of law I was made a fool because I didn't have an attorney and I was made to stand up in the court of law and I was told that the case is dismissed, go home.  And that was when I left the court.\n One day when I was at Church, another person came and he said, \"Sir I'm coming to you to ask for forgiveness.  What we did to you was really unacceptable. Please forgive me.\"  He was crying and I cried also, I was surprised, I did not know what to say to this person.  And I said to him, \"Okay that's fine\".  And that was the end of it all.  I thank you today that I am here.  I'm glad that I managed to NELSPRUIT  HEARING TRC/MPUMALANGA\n5 MASANGANE\ncome and I'm glad that there are other people who value human live.  This boy came to me and he asked for forgiveness.  God was so great to protect my family, because my wife had a chance to take them away.  I thank God because he helped me.  I don't want to add, I don't want to reduce any information.  I thank you.",

Now of course, you know who to forgive and you know what you have to forgive.  But it's a very hard thing to do, and I'm not going to press you on that.
