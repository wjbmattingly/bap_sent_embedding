On behalf of the implicated person, Madoda Kula, he has submitted a written statement, it is not in affidavit form, to the Commission and to the Committee and he has, in respect of an unrelated matter, made application for amnesty, a copy of which is attached to his written representation of his statement.  Mr Chairperson, you will note from the content of that statement it is a short one, Mr Kula, Mr Madoda Kula maintains that he was not present at the incident to which two witnesses immediately preceding us have testified.  Based on what I have heard and, presumably, what you yourself Mr Chairperson, members of the Committee have heard, there is no evidence to show that Madoda Kula was indeed a member of that group that attacked that house.  It was a tragic incident.  We also are not without emotion.  We sympathise with the members of the family.  However, we maintain our innocence in respect of that particular incident.  We also wish to point out that two other persons mentioned in the notification send to us, were, in fact, according to our knowledge, charged with that incident and subsequently acquitted.  It is not as has been testified to by the witnesses that the case was simply withdrawn.  Our knowledge is to the effect that they were acquitted after due process of law.  We wish to confirm ...",

Such information which came to hand later was hearsay, second or third-hand at best and it is upon that basis too that the submission is made on behalf of Madoda Kula that he cannot be implicated at this stage on evidence before the Committee in that incident.\n An additional aspect which we wish to highlight and to confirm, because it has been testified to by the two witnesses preceding us, is that Mr Madoda Kula was on the identity parade about which there has been evidence before this Committee and he was not identified.
