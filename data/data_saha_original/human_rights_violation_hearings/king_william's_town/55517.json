            "The police arrived at home, White police, it was at night.  They pushed the door down, they said they were looking for Madoda Menesi, these are my sons names.\n I told them that he was not there, they said I would tell them.   They said that I must take them to his room.  We went to his room because I stayed in a rondawel.  There is a bigger house with three rooms.\n There were six police, all White policemen.  When I got there, they asked where he was.  I said that he left in the afternoon, I do not know where he is.  They slapped me, they kicked me, I wet myself.  They said that the truth is coming, that is why I was wetting myself.\n I said I did not know where he was, he had left in the afternoon.  They left.  They said I must go back to my rondawel.  I went in.  The next day they came, four White men, they were looking for Madoda again.\n They would wake me up every night.   They would beat me up.  They would not find him, I would not know where he was.  The third time Vusumzi and Sipho Ntebe also came in the middle of the night.   They came into my hut, pushed the door down, woke me up.  I could not sleep well, I could not even go to other people's houses, because I did not want to endanger other people's lives.\n I became an insomniac.  They said that we must go to my son's room which was painted red.  Vusumzi had a big rifle, Ntebe as well.  Ntebe did not do anything to me.\n When Vusumzi would ask for my son and I would say I do not know, they said that they were going to beat me up.  I said I had no other truth, Vusumzi slapped me, beat me with a rifle at the back, at the back of my head, I bled.\n They asked where he would go for holidays.  I said that he usually goes to my sister in Mdantsane and I've never been to Mdantsane.  Vusumzi would slap me and kick me, Ntebe never touched me.\n Ntebe then said they must go.  Vusumzi said he is taking me to Mdantsane to point out my son.  We went to Mdantsane, this is at night, the three of us.\n Vusumzi was drunk.  When we got to the main road, it had been raining the previous day.  Vusumzi would turn back, hit me with the rifle.  When we got to the main road, there was a whole lot of water.  Just before he was going to hit me with the rifle again, he slipped and fell on the water, he said that he was going to really hit me then, because I had been fighting, he alleged.\n A police van approached with two White policemen.  Vusumzi took me from place to place, he was at the back with me.  He kept on hitting me with his rifle.  When we got there, there were two White police.\n Vusumzi took a sail, put it over my face.  He said that I was going to tell the truth and we were going to Mdantsane.  Vusumzi put something over my head.  After a while he took it off.  \n They insisted that I knew where my son was.  I said that you said we are going to Mdantsane, I was not well at the time because I don't even know Mdantsane.  He put this thing over my head again.\n He again insisted that I knew where my son was.  He put this thing over my head yet again.  When I thought in my heart that I am going to die and I don't know who is going to feed my child, because I had no husband, that thought still stifles me.\n I was thinking about my child, Vusumzi threw me onto the floor.  Vusumzi continued to ask for my son.  The two White policemen were laughing.  This one Coloured man who passed away said that what you are doing, is terrible, because parents don't know what children do.",

I went home, I thought about this, I thought why must I be arrested, why must I go back to the police when I've done nothing, so I did not go.\n After a week, I went to Tabata in King William's Town, I told him what happened, he said he is busy, but he would follow up my case.  Before he arrived, I was called into the office.  They said that they are going to discuss my case together with Vusumzi.\n There were six White men and Vusumzi, his brother, his father, I was alone.  They asked me what had happened, I told them.  They said I was drunk.\n I said I had not been drinking, it was a Thursday, I don't drink Brandy.  I only drink Xhoza beer weekends.

In this country this was common.  Thank you for having come here today and giving us a clear story, divulging all to a point where you wept.\n We trust that even before (indistinct) today.  It is sad that Sipho Ntebe passed away, because we would have liked to thank him, because even amongst the police of Stutterheim at the time, someone was kind enough to show you a bit of kindness.\n Thank you, you may step down.
