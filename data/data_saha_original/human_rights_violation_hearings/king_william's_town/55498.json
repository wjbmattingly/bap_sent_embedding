He then told us to go to ANC offices to report this incident.  He took me, my husband and my son.  We went to the ANC offices.  The Reverend said that he brought this man to report that his house was burnt down.  At the day of the Bisho massacre this man, my husband, was there.  At that time he was not working.  On that Bisho day the Reverend said that he was the one who took my husband at home, but the people in the village said that my husband was taken back home by the police car.\n One of his friends told him that you are going to be necklaced, because you are getting R800,00 as a headman.  I said that how can I do such a thing, because my wife is working for Reverend Notshe and she is getting R200,00.  I am not a headman.  My husband did not do anything about this, because he knew that he was not a headman.  After this, on the 28th, we found our house in flames.  When we came back from the office the Reverend told me to stay at home for a while.  It was on the 28th.  In the afternoon my husband told me that he was going to examine the damage in the house.  He was together with one child.  This child then came back home saying that there are people with petrol near the house and they were saying that they are going to burn my husband.  This child said that one of them said he cannot do this, he cannot burn a person to death.  \n We then decided to go to the police and to report this matter.  The phones in that area were not working.  We went to the taxi rank to take a taxi.  These people were still in front of my house.  When we were in Gqumahashe one of the people with me said that my husband was the one being chased by these children.  They were, they had tyres and petrol with them.  I could not see him at that time.  We then took a taxi, but this child said that, told me that these people set these tyres alight.  When we were approaching Mr Finca's house in town we saw the Reverend in his car.  I told the taxi driver to stop the taxi so that I can go to the Reverend. I told him that, Reverend, they have killed my husband.  The Reverend said to me, do not say that, because you did not see this.  He took us to his home.  He left us there saying that he was going to look at what was happening in that area.  \n The Reverend came back.  He asked me whether he must take me home.  I said, yes, he must take me home.  He took me to Didage at home.  I told my mother about this.  My mother said that we will, in the morning, the next morning we will go there and find out what happened.  My sister then came together with my cousin from Alice telling me that my husband died.   My sister would be the one who will know what exactly happened.",

We remember that your husband was killed and his body was lying there, the dogs were also there surrounding the body.  There are many things done by people on behalf of the struggle.  Some of these things are very sad.  We thank you for coming forward.  We have noted your request that you would like us, as a Commission, to investigate and to find out who are the perpetrators so that they can ask for forgiveness or they must get punishment for what they have done.  We thank you and we will look at your requests.  We sympathise with you as the Commission.  Thank you mam.  You may now step down.",
