<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">SANELE WELLINGTON SINAM:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Let me lead him, Mr Chairperson.  Briefly, sir, please tell us your story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> On the tenth of August 1992 I was due to be on duty at quarter to ten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were you a police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes, I was a policeman.  At about half past 11 I received a phone call from a woman.  She asked a man who was also a police.  I then told this woman to phone Middeldrift Prison, because I do not know where this man was.  At about quarter to 12 pm I received another phone call that I must go and call Mr Yawa.  His girlfriend was the one who was phoning.  I told this lady that I cannot leave the charge office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were you alone at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes, I was alone on duty.  She then asked me to go and call him.  I then asked for her phone numbers.   She said that it was 91.  When I came back I found out that this person was not alone.  I told her that Yawa said that he cannot come to the phone, but at about 12pm as I was inside the charge office a white City Golf stopped in front of the police station.  Three men entered the charge office and they knocked.  I said they must come in.  One of them had a balaclava on and pointed me with the gun.  The two of them told me to close my eyes and lay down.  I did what they wanted me to do.  They then tied me, they hand-cuffed me in my hands and my legs.  At the time my eyes were closed, I could not do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> They asked for the safe keys. I told them that they were in my pocket.  One of them took the keys out.  He opened the safe.  While they were doing that one of them came to me and told me to open my eyes.  I then opened my eyes.  He told me to close my eyes again after telling me that they were going to burn down my home.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What happened, what did these people do to you after all this?  The opened a safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes, they opened a safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> They took what was in the safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What was in the safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> They took six rifles from the safe.  They also took my gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Do you know these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> No, I do not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What about Yawa?  Did he know the girl who phoned him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> I think so, because he answered by saying that he does not have time to go and answer the phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you make a statement to report about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes, I made a statement to the police.  I made a statement in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> When did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> It happened in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you make a statement at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> What I did at that time is that I untied myself in my legs and in my hands. I woke the Station Commander telling him that the guns and the rifles have been stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Do you have an occurrence book?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> I could not write at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> These people had already left.  You had to write a report.  where did  you write a report about what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> I did not write a report about what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Even in your occurrence book you did not write what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What happened when you were confronted by the Ciskeian Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> The Station Commander reported this in Bisho.  The security from Alice, the security branch from Alice arrived.  One of them, Malo, untied me.  They took me to the office of the branch commander.  They asked me where the guns were.  They said that these people were my friends.  They were beating me and they said that they were not afraid or scared of the people who took these guns.  I must tell them who the people were, because they said that they were my friends.  I then fainted after they had been beating me up.  When I woke up I could see that I was bleeding through my ears and my mouth.  I was also injured in my legs and my hands, because they made me to do push-ups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a> There was one police left there and I saw that it was Captain Sihluku.  While I was trying to wipe the blood in my mouth he told me to stop.  He went out to the charge office to take the investigator, Mr Mhambi.  They took me to their office, the offices of the investigators.  He took me back so that I can be tortured.  They did not stop there.  They were assaulting me.  I was, they covered me with a jersey.  I did not know or see who they were.  I told them that I just want to breathe.  They must give me a chance.  They then took off this jersey over my face.  I could see that these are the same people who were assaulting me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> After all  this did you, were you, was there, were you charged of anything?</p>

<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did he tell you about the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Dorrington did not tell me anything about the case.  I wrote a letter to him saying that I mentioned his name in, he then said that my case was a criminal trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  You, Mr Sinam, you were dismissed from work.  Before you were dismissed was there any internal inquiry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes, there was an internal inquiry while I was still detained.  They asked me whether I wanted a legal representative.  I said yes, but this did not continue.  When I was released on the first of September at about, on the 18th of September I was called to appear in front of this investigating unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you appear there with your attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did they give you reasons to dismiss you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who was in authority in Seymour at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> He was Mongwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where is he now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> I think he is in Stutterheim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you retire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were tortured with electric shocks.  Who was doing this to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> It was Mbagu and Mhambi, the two investigators.  It was on a Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As you were a police was this a form of torture that was used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINAM:</span> I would just hear people crying, but at that time I can say that this kind of torture was the one used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Sinam.  We will try to contact  Mr Dorrington so that we can hear his side of the story so that we can also find out who is the investigating officer of your case.  This is a painful story.  We did not know that the police were also tortured in this way.  Maybe you will help us to find out about the things that happened in Seymour at this time when we are investigating your case.  For now, thank you Mr Sinam.</p>
