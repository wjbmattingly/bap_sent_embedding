            "On the 19th of September in 1992 my uncle left our house to go back home.  He met two soldiers.  They asked where he had come from.  He said he had come from Johannesburg.  Then they said that he had burnt down Makhapela's house.  He said he did not know anything about this.  They took him, beat him up and took him to Mr Makhapela's house.  At Mr Makhapela's house he cried out saying that he had done nothing, he does not know why he is being beaten up.  A little while after he had beaten up he walked out.  The soldiers followed him shooting him until he went through a passage.  As he was going through a passage going home his jacket got caught in a fence and he fell.\n As he was lying there the police kicked him saying that he was pretending that he was dead.  Malule, his brother, came through.  He was watching.  After that they realised that he had died.  They left him there and they went to Makhapela's house.  At home where I stay my sister-in-law came telling me that my uncle had been beaten by soldiers who are staying at Mr Makhapela's house.  I went going home.  When I got home I thought that I would find him and take him to hospital, but when I got there he was, I tested his pulse and touched his eyes.  He was not blinking.  I realised that he was dead.  I wept and I thought to myself, I have no mother, I have no father.  He was a father to me.  What is going to happen to me?\n After that we went to Chief Mbandla's house to report this matter.  Chief Mbandla said he had no phone.  We got a lift to the police station.  When we got there we presented the case.  The police said to us we had burnt down Makhapela's house, but we go back to report the case to them.  Makhapela said the man who is killed is not guilty.  The one police said we must wait, the police vans were deployed, they would come back later.  At eight o' clock a bakkie came, a police van.  They took us back home and they also took us to the corpse where my uncle lay.  It was half past eight at the time.  Mr Jonas took over so that we could bury him properly.",
