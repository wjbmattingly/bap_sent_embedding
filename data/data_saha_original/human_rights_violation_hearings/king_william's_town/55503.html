<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will now ask the attorney, Mr Mlalane together with Fezile Ndongeni to come forward.  Mr Mlalane, you are representing Fezile Ndongeni on the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Do you want to address us?  Are you going to lead the witness?  Are you going to read the statement into the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> I am just going to make a short resume of what happened and then he is going to do the talking himself.  He can talk, he is old enough.  First of all ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Go ahead Mr Mlalane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> Thanks.  First of all, this matter is a matter of inquest at Alice and judgement has been reserved and the real problem is finding witnesses and this happened at night.  Apparently there were two groups of the African National Congress and the two groups were not in agreement and there is no evidence yet that my client was the leader of the other group, but is suspicious that he was probably taking a leading part and my client, as he says, was he friend of Mr Papu.  Mr Papu was actually brought by him to that area.  There was no animosity, but in the middle of the night there was this fight.  My client ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just clarify something, Mr Mlalane.  You say this matter is already before the court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> It is already before the court and judgement ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you are awaiting judgement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> We are awaiting judgement and I am appearing in the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to insist on addressing us on this matter or are you feeling that, perhaps, you are obliged to do so because we sent you a notice?  I am just afraid ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> I feel I am obliged to, otherwise, because this court does not know anything of sub-judaica.  Otherwise I would have raised that this is sub-judaica, because we are awaiting judgement in this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I would like to consult with the Committee quickly and, perhaps, let us come back to you, just.  Sir, you consulted us (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> Yes I am (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct).  Mr Mlalane, that we accept and just put it on record and when we are contemplating making a finding on Mr Ndongeni we will then inform you and then you can make representation at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MLALANE:</span> May I be excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please.</p>
