I took my son's clothing and threw it out of the window.  Eric then told me that my, members of my family had also been shot.  They did not find him there.  Then these people knocked and opened the door and they shot everybody in the house.  I asked them to leave, because I was scared that they were going to come to me.  Nontsikelelo came and knocked on my window, had been shot.  She asked me to open the door.  She told me that she had been shot in the legs.  I was scared to switch on the light.  I took Nontsikelelo, put her under covers, gave her a nappy to bind her wounds.  I asked her if her upper body had been injured.  She said, no, it was just her legs. I asked what had happened at home.  She told me that Vuyokazi and Nowinile had died, shot dead.  She told me that my father was alive.\n We could not move, because we did not know where the enemy was.  My brother came, knocked, told me that my father, as well, had died.  Tammy also came, who had run with Eric.  They hired a car.  We took Nontsikelelo to hospital in Alice.  My brother, Cobert, was also in the car and we dropped him off at the police station in Alice to give a report and statement.  There were bottles that my brother had picked up.  No, there were bullets that my brother had picked up. I left them at the ANC office.  People who worked at Fort Hare came.  We told them what had happened.  We were then taken, the media came and we all went to Msobomvu.  The corpses had been taken by the police.  There was blood everywhere. The furniture was destroyed.  It was chaos.",

When I got there he was not there.  The window was opened.  I jumped out of the same window.  I went to our next door neighbours.  My brother was there.  He was in a drum of water.  He then leapt out of the water.  He helped me run, because I was weak.  I said that we must go to my sister.  When we got there I told my sister that people at home had been shot.  Before I got to my sister we heard sounds, bullet sounds, exactly the way they sounded when I was being shot.  Then a grenade went off.  There was an explosion.  After he had shot at me as well a grenade was shot, was thrown.  When I got to my sister I told her what happened.  We left my sister.  We went to a man from another village asking for help.

There were doubts that you would come before the Commission, but we are grateful that you eventually came, because we know that something like this we cannot just forget about until the truth has been found.
