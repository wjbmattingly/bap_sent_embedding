The evidence that you are going to give the Commission to-day is about Kenneth Masibonge, who was  shot  in 1987 when he was 17 years of  age.  Is that so ?  Was Kenneth you child  ?</p>

<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Could you tell us the story please Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MFONO:</span> I just heard bullet sounds, twice.  I did not take them seriously, it was a night.  I slept.  The next morning, the other kids said I must go ask where Masibonge had been arrested.  I asked where he was.  The said that the police had taken him. I went to the police station, told them I was looking for Masibonge.  The police said he was not there.  I went to the hospital.  It was at Frere Hospital.  I found out then that he was there at the hospital.  After that, the sister went to visit at Frere and found him there.  I was asked to go and sign some documents because he was going to be transferred to Cape Town.  He was shot at the side.  He was going to be taken to Cape Town.  I went and signed the documents.  He came back from Cape Town in June the same year.  He could not do anything for himself.  He was paralyzed.  He cannot do anything for himself.  The police came and fetched him.  He was asked to come to court, to appear in court, both with the other kids ...</p>

Apparently,   on   the Thursday he'd been elected as the ANC Chairperson.  On the Sunday he was going to take his position, take up his position as the Chairperson.  Apparently, at about 3 a.m.  on Sunday, somebody knocked on his window.  He got out.  When he got out, there were two doors, he used the back door.  By the steps he came across these people who stabbed him.  I was taken from Keimouth and the corps was already taken.  I was told that they stabbed him to death and left him to die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know who it is that warned him ?</p>

<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you find out who it is that murdered him ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MBELEKANA:</span> No, this is why I'm here, I want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you talk to the person who came to warn him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MBELEKANA:</span> No.  There were investigators.  I don't know what happened eventually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Neliswa, would you like to add something ?  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS DYEVANA:</span> Mbulelo passed away on Sunday.  It was about 9 a.m.  When I got up I went to get some water.  I stay with my grandmother and aunt.  A child asked if I knew that Mbulelo had passed away.  I said no, the last time I had seen him was the previous night.  When I got to the gate there were a whole lot of people.  I asked if it's true that he'd died.  Young children answered me and told me that yes, he'd passed away and he was left by the guava tree.  I went to church, my father told me exactly what happened.  Apparently, he'd been with his girlfriend.  What happened is, when the person knocked,</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>the girlfriend hid herself under the bed.  I asked how she'd hidden herself under the bed because you cannot hide yourself under a double bed base and I asked why it is that she should hide herself.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA :</span> Did she perhaps think that it's another of his girlfriends ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS DVENAYA:</span> I said, no, it's impossible.  Investigators came, pictures were taken.  Mrs Mbelekana came back from Keimouth to work back at home.  The investigators said that , they know who the perpetrators are.  I asked, why they are not arresting anyone.  This investigator then said, they investigated and said he went to the Prosecutor wanting a warrant of arrest.  We were hopeful.  Nothing ever came of it, to this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is that all you have to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS DYEVANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Sithabathaba, would you like to add something but apparently, you are the uncle to the deceased ?  When you heard that something had happened, what did you find out ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR  SITHABATHABA:</span> Somebody  came  and  knocked  and  said  Mbulelo had passed  away.  I went and indeed he'd was, he'd already passed on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You never found out who it is that murdered him ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR  SITHABATHABA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In our statement, Mbulelo was murdered by ANC members as he was going to be the new executive.  These people together with other members of yet another organization.  Could you tell us more about this ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR  SITHABATHABA:</span> On the 11th of  January, Mr Zola, an investigator came, told me that he'd gotten the people.  They were ANC members and PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Therefore, it is members of the two organizations ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR  SITHABATHABA:</span> Yes, ANC and PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you hear of any reasons ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR  SITHABATHABA:</span> No.  This is what we'd also like to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was this a norm, that when such things would happen, these organizations would come together and attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR  SITHABATHABA:</span> I'd never heard of it before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you.  Do you have requests to the Commission ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MBELEKANA:</span> First of all, I request that the case be investigated and I want to know who killed Mbulelo, he's, he was my only child.  The father died in 1982.  Secondly, Mbulelo passed away.  I'm alone, I need a house to be built.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was Mbulelo your only child ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MBELEKANA:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You don't have a child ..</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MBELEKANA:</span> No.  There's a ten year old who's my grand-niece from Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you, I'll hand you over to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thank you all for telling us about these incidents.  We know Komga velly, very well especially in connection with battles that took place there.   Even though it is difficult for you to be comforted.  However, a lot of work was done in Komga and around the border region.  We will look closely at your requests.  If it was up to us, we would meet all these needs, but we depend on the President to see what he can do, but in the meantime, we thank you.   Please step down.</p>
