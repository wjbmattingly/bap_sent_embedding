<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mrs Papu, you are also from Alice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> No, I am from Makuzeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You are from the village of Makuzeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The incident which you are going to talk about took place on the 3rd of April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I will now hand over to you to tell us what happened on this particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> On this day we were at home.  The group, my husband's group came at home to look at what was happening.  They saw that things were quiet.  My husband told them to leave, because that day there were no people around.  At midnight my husband said that we must sleep and these people must leave.  Only three of them have to stay.  He then told us to go to sleep.  It was myself and another woman who was staying in the Makuzeni village, but now she is in Zizinie.  We slept together with that woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> While we were sleeping we heard something on the door.  This woman by the name of No-First ran out and I followed her.  A petrol bomb in our street was thrown.  I saw my husband running.  We also ran,  No-First and myself.  There were two cars, Isuzu and Mazda.  We went through these cars.  We saw that there were people who were chasing him.  It was Mr Fezile Ndongeni, Gumeli Tselane and one young man from Fana family, but I do not remember his name.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was he Nombombo Tselane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes, he was chased by four people.  After that it was dark.  We saw that there was one of them with a torch.  He was following us.  No-First ran away.  He ran to tell people that Papu was being killed.  After that, as I was sleeping with children, I took children to the neighbour, my grandchildren.  One of them was three years old, the other was 11 years and the other one was eight years old.  I took them to my neighbour's house.  I was crying.  My neighbour told me not to cry, because these people would come in that house.  I then stopped crying.  I peeped through the window, because I wanted to see what was happening, but I could not see, because my house was on the other side, on the other street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> While I was still looking through the window I saw a light coming from Gomorro.  It was a car.  I saw this car that it was going towards my house.  It stopped at my house.  I told this, my neighbour to look after the children, because I was going to see what was happening.  I saw my husband lying down with a wound in the head and in the stomach.  There was water all over.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why was your husband attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> He was attacked because he was an ANC member.  He was an ANC activist.  There was a group who was against the ANC.  They wanted to be the leaders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> This group, where did it come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> It was the group from the village that because they wanted to overthrow the executive of the ANC at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was there anyone arrested concerning this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes, five people were arrested.  Gumeli was also arrested, but he was acquitted.  When he arrived at the police station he told the police everything that was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who was Gumeli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> It was Gumeli Fana.  He told the police everything that was happening.  He told that Mr Fezile paid them together with Landezwa to go and kill my husband.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you are talking about Mr Fezile are you talking about Fezile Ndongeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The people you mentioned in your statement, Vuyile Mbane, Fezile Ndongeni and Tselane Nombombo, did you know these people before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes, I knew them, because when our homes were stoned and the cars they were there.  Even when we were going to town they would stop us telling us that we are not allowed to go to town.  The windows were broke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The people you mentioned, Gumeli Papu, was he arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> It was Lichlie Papu and Gumeli Fana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were they arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Yes, they were arrested, but they were released.  They gave a statement to the police saying that Landezwa and the other man paid them to do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was there anyone charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> The case is still on, but the witnesses, the magistrates witnesses cannot be found.  They ran away since they were released.  I heard that they have been arrested.  I heard that Gumeli was arrested, but when we went to court I told them that he was in Qesi, but at the time of the court case he was not there.  I was told that he was released.  So there are no witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Where is this case held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> In Alice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all you wanted to say, Mrs Papu, concerning this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS PAPU:</span> Before that one woman came together with the police.  There were houses which were burnt down.  This woman said that my husband was the one who burnt down these houses.  I asked them how my husband could do that, because his house was stoned on the day before the Good Friday, but the petrol bomb did not work, did not explode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I notice that you have requests in your statement.  You mention that you wanted, you want to be assisted with the education of your children.</p>
