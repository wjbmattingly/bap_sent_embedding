<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old are you Mr Jawe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I am 22 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You look pretty young.  I thought you were 14, because people under the age of 18 do not appear before the Commission on their own.  Reverend Xundu will swear you in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Shepherd Lulamile Jawe please get up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">SHEPHERD LULAMILE JAWE:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>

<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tiny Maya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Good afternoon Lulamile.  You are going to talk about yourself, an incident in 1985 when you were ten years old.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you know what was happening at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes, my family told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Tell us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> It was 1985 on the 20th of September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Please speak up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> It was 1985 on the 20th of September.  We were in the village singing songs, liberation songs.  We were singing moving down the streets.  It was at about nine in the evening.  As we were singing the police came with torches and there was teargas and we were shot with rubber bullets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What village was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> It was Lenge in Alice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> When we heard that we were being shot with rubber bullets and that there was teargas we ran away, jumping over fences.  As I was running, jumping over a fence, I fell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Please speak up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> As I was jumping over the fence, because it was at night, I fell.  The police got me.  Some people, as they were running, would trample over me.  I was beaten with the back of a rifle on my head.  I became unconscious.  The next thing I knew I was at Cecilia Makiwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> How injured were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> On my head, I was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How long did you stay in hospital for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I stayed for two to three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What standard were you doing at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I was in standard one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> After you got out of hospital were you able to go back to school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes, I went back to school the following year.  I went and repeated my standard one.  I continued until I finished my matric.  I had problems, however.  I could not hear properly.  I am mentally not well.  Apparently I am deranged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Does that happen to you often?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> It happens, but seldom.  It use to happen a lot around 1992, 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Are you getting help from the doctors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I use to go for help, because whilst I was at school it use to happen quite a bit, but now I am better.  It happens now even, but seldom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you think that you still need further treatment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes, I could use some help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you see who beat you up?  Did you see who hit you with the back of the rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> No, it was at night, but what happened is that as they were hitting us they called out names and I remember the names.  I heard three names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> It is Mr Fila, who was a police in Ciskei, a policeman, Mr Ngonyama and Mr Skhephe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Did you see them after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I last saw them three years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You do not know where they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> No, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were they members of the police force in Ciskei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> And they were stationed in Alice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is that all Lulamile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What requests do you have before the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I need help, because I am not well.  I want to continue with my education, but I cannot because I was gravely affected mentally.  If the Commission could help me and perhaps some form of compensation for myself and my parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> If you would see these police that injured you at such a tender age, what would you say to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I do not know what I would say, because I am still much younger than them, even now.  There is nothing I can do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What would you like the Commission to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> If the Commission could investigate and arrest them, divulge all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said you finished your matric.  What are you doing now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I am not doing anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Lulamile.  I will hand you over to the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Jawe, you say that Mr Fila, Mr Ngonyama and Mr Skhephe were involved in your injuries.  Do you have their first names, these are surnames?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I do not have their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you can identify these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> No, I did not see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, are there any other questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Yes, can I ask a few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Jawe, can you hear me?  Mr Jawe, you were with a group of children on that day singing freedom songs.  Were there other children that were injured on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Will you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> My question is were there other children injured on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Do you know how many or do you know anything about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> I do not know how many there were, but I know one who is here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And he was present and he saw what happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Well, I do not know, because we had dispersed, we were running away, but he was there.  He was also injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> But you know him well enough to be able to ask him the question as to whether he can identify these three people who you have identified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Well, I do not know, perhaps he can be able to identify these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Alright, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Jawe, you stay at Lenge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Yes Reverend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know the police at Lenge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> There is one Ciskeian police in Lenge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> Mr Mafu, but at that time he was not a policeman yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Therefore you did not know the police at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR JAWE:</span> There were no police at Lenge at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Thank you Mr Jawe.  Thank you for your evidence.  There are two submissions.  The first one from Mr Ngonyama, the second one from Mr Skhephe.  Mr Ngonyama is represented by Mr Mlalane.</p>
