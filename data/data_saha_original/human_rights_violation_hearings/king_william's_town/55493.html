<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Mrs Bata, I also welcome you.  You are going to talk about Lizo Desmond Bata, is that so ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BATA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> The late Mr Bata was your husband, is that so ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BATA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Could you tell us fully what happened to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BATA:</span> It was in 1992, on a Monday that, at about, before 9 o'clock, we were watching TV and we heard a sound.  Something was being thrown, we thought.  My husband got up to peep  He opened the door, the front door, he did not see anything.  He closed the door but there was a funny smell, like smoke.  He then went towards the back to see what was happening.  As we were running towards the bedroom.  We went towards</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>the bedroom, running from the smoke.  We got into the bedrooms then one of the children shouted that we should go outside because we are going to suffocate from the smoke.  We ran over the fence and we went to our next-door neighbour's house.  We did not know what was going on.  An ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital.  I heard at the hospital the next day that my husband had passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR SANDI:</span> Were there people  Mrs Bata, who were arrested for this ?.</p>
