<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairperson, I would like to swear in Mkhululi Mvuzo Sizani.  Please stand up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MKHULULI MVUZO SIZANI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, he has been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Good afternoon Mr Sizani.  Can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we ask that the cell phone be switched off please.  It is constantly interrupting us.  I think I have heard it more than twice now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Sizani, you are understanding that you can answer in Xhosa and I will have an interpretation.  Now, the  incident that you have come to tell us about today happened on the same day as the Bisho massacre.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Mr Chairperson, I made a mistake in the date, because it was on the 19th.  I stated that it was on the seventh.  That is a mistake.  It was on the 19th of September 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Alright then, Mr Sizani, would you then like to tell us what you were accused and by whom you were accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Mr Chairperson, I was accused by our headman, Mr Malangeni Makapela, he accused me of burning down his home.  On that day I was at home.  I heard that the house was being burnt down.  I saw flames in that house.  My uncle said that I must stay at home, because people were gathering together to go and look at what was happening.  I stayed at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> The next morning the police came.  I am sorry, the soldier, Lindile Mashiqa and Luvuyo Matyila.  When they arrived I was in my grandfather's house.  I was eating bread, because I did not eat the whole day.  While I was still eating Luvuyo Matyila came in together with Makayise.  He asked whether I was Mkhululi Sizani.  He was having, he was holding a R4.  I said, yes, I am Mkhululi Sizani.  He said that I must finish what I was eating.  After a while Lindile Mashiqa also arrived.  I think he was outside at the time.  When he got inside he said to me, let us go.  He did not ask anything.  Because they were drunk they took me.  I asked them where are we going.  They said that we are going to Mr Malangeni's house.  They were assaulting me all the time with the back of their R4's.  They beat me in my head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> We then arrived at Mr Malangeni's house.  I was shown a letter.  They were beating me.  They said that Thembinkosi Jakaza.  They asked me to go and point Thembinkosi Jakaza's house.  We went there, but Thembinkosi was not there, his father was there.  My grandmother told my uncle that these soldiers were going to kill me.  My uncle would go and talk to them so that they can stop what they were doing.  He went to these men.  He told them that this young man was not in this incident.  He was then also assaulted, because these men did not want to listen to him.  I told them that I have a witness, the person with whom I was with during this incident.  Lindile ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Can you just, I just want to stop you for one moment.  Can you tell me the name of that witness.  Was that Thembinkosi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Yes, it is Thembinkosi.  When we were about to approach a corner Lindile came, shot me in my left knee.  I did not hear that I have been shot, but while I was still  walking I saw that I was shot and I fell down.  When I was trying to stand up they were beating me and assaulting me with their rifles.  After a while two young boys at about 12 years of age, they passed us and they were called.  They were, these men told them to take me.  We were then on our way to this eye-witness, but unfortunately he was not there.  We arrived at the house of Simphizwe Mabambolo.  The door was locked.  They were beating me at this time.  I could not do anything, they were assaulting me.  After a while then they instructed these boys to take me to Mr Malanageni's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> While we were on our way approaching this house they put me down and they told these boys to leave.  I was told to go with, I was told to crawl.  Lindile and Luvuyo would insult me all the time.  They said that I was going to tell  them who actually burnt this house.  When we arrived there I asked for water, because I was thirsty.  Lindile Mashiqa gave me a five litre.  I was forced to finish the water.   Like a monkey I would drink the water partially as some of it would be spilt out.  They then would take my teeth and hit them against a rough stone.  My teeth are damaged.  It was at about three when the police came.  I was then taken to the hospital.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a> As I was being taken to the hospital the police van went via a village.  I was in great pain.  When I got to the hospital, but before we got there I was taken to the charge office and I was identified.  At the hospital they then referred to, referred me to Makiwane Hospital.  I spent four months there.  I just need a glass of water.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> While you are drinking that I just want to ask  you a question.  When you were being taken by the two 12 year old boys, what were they, why were they asked to help with that process of taking you to Mr Malangeni's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> There was no transport as such so they took a wheelbarrow and put me on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> I see, so they were just helping, alright.  So when they had finished assaulting you they took you to the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> I was taken to the hospital, Victoria Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And you were there for four months.  Now, during that time did you make a statement then or did you make a statement after that to the police about what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> I gave them my statement after I was released from hospital, January 1993.  I was referred to Makiwane Hospital.  That is where I spent the four months.  The investigators came to my house.  They said that I must go to Dan Hans to get, to give a statement.  It is where the investigators have their offices.  The investigator said to me that they are still investigating the matter until Lindile and Luvuyo were found.  I heard nothing after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Up till this time you have heard nothing?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Now, at the time that this all happened, you, were you still at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Yes, I was still at school at the time of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> What standard had you completed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> I was in standard nine at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Is there anything particular that you want the Commission to consider doing about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Yes, I am not well.  I was never well after this.  My request to the Commission is that the people who are perpetrators must come forward to the Commission.  I need compensation.  I was not born like this.  People who see me now cry.  They cannot believe it is I who is like this.  There are a lot of things.  Even when I am thinking  I get very nervous.  This does not make me happy at all.  It depresses me.  I need these perpetrators to come before the Truth Commission.  They have to divulge all.  I need to know why they shot me.  I was not one of the people who ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Did you say earlier on that you do not know where these people are, because in your statement it says that they stay in the same neighbourhood.  Was that at the time of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> Yes, they were in the neighbourhood.  They were in a village next to us.  The distance is between Bisho and King William's Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> But they are no longer there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> There is one that is still there, Mashiqa.  I see him now and again, but apparently he is a soldier in Dimbaza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And how is your relationship with him and how is the relationship between your communities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> When we see each other, as I have been to that village before, I cannot even greet him, cannot say anything to him, because I am like this because of them.  I cannot bear talking to them.  My life is not as it should be as a result of their ill-treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> My last question to you, Mr Sizani, is did you ever approach an attorney about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIZANI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you. I am going to hand you back to the Chairperson now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sizani, there are no further questions.  Your case is clear.  We have heard your requests before the Commission.  We are quite interested, as well, that if these people have applied for amnesty we will link the cases.  I do not know if they will allow, because you say, you request that you be given some compensation from their own salaries.  People do not want this, they just want forgiveness.  We sympathise with you.  We will look carefully at your requests.  Thank you.  You may step down.</p>
