<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may sit down Sir, thank you.  We welcome you.  We will hand over to Ms Maya to lead you with questions on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson  .Mr Mathinzini you are here to-day to talk about what happened to you on the 15th of May.  Is that correct ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where are you from Sir ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> I'm from Mxhalanga Location .</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Please tell us briefly what happened to you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> My house was burnt down.  I was inside the house.  They poured petrol in my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened before that, Sir ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> I  arrived from Johannesburg in 1992.  I was then elected as a Chairperson of the School Committee.  I agreed to take that position.  After a while I found out that the people were against Mr Booi.  They wanted him to be dismissed.  As a School Committee we said that we have to have a meeting so that we can discuss this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who are these people who were, who wanted Mr Booi to be dismissed ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> They were people from Mxhalanga Location.  They wouldn't go the principal to tell him that they were against him.  When the Councillors' houses were burnt down, my house was also burnt down.  They threw stones in my house.  They said that I was on the School Committee, I was also involved in the Community.  The people from 6 villages came to my house to burn down my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Why was your house burnt down when the Councillors' houses were burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> The reason is that they said that as a Chairperson of the School Committee, I have a lot to say, because I told them to come forward to say that they were against the Principal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Can you please explain to us, what was happening in the Community, between the Councillors and the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> The people are against the Councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What was the connection between you and the Councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> There was no connection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were you a member of any political or residents association?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> I was an ANC member.  I joined the ANC in Johannesburg, but because I was on that teacher's side, people did not like me.   I would accompany the teacher to the Councillor's house, to the Headman house as the as the Chairperson of the School Committee.   That's how I got involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was it the usual thing that the teacher would go to the Headman to report what was happening at school ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Mr Booi, was he a member of any organization ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> I don't know, but he used to say that he was not a member of  an ADM, PAC or ANC.  He  supported all the organizations because he was the principal of the school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> According to your statement you said that you were accused of being a member of the ADM.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> Yes, that's what they said but I told them that I don't even have a member, a membership card of ADM.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What was the damage in your house ?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> My furniture got burnt down.  My leg was, I broke my leg.</p>

<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> As we are staying in the villages, our windows are high.  I tried to jump from a window, I then fell down.  That's why, that's how I got injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Your house was burnt down.  You were trying to escape through a window.  You then broke your leg.  What time was it ?.</p>

<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> Yes, that is all.  That's what they've done to me.  I tried to re-build my house, but I don't have money.  When I came back from Johannesburg I had R17.000-00.  I paid for my daughter's wedding.  I was not working at that time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATHINZINI:</span> Mr Dorrington.  The lawyers would change from one lawyer to the other.  In March I was told that the case will be on.  When  I got there, they said that it was postponed, but I according to myself, I think that they will not help me.</p>
