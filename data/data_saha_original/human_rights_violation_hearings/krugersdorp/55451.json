            "When Japie left in 1977 we were very hurt.  Japie was the child whom we loved very much.  He was active. He liked going to school.  He was very intelligent. He liked children.  After he left, he disappeared.  We were surprised and wondered where he was. After a week the police came and these police tortured my mother.  Then they searched the house.\n Before the police came, when Japie arrived in Botswana, he wrote a letter.  In that letter he wrote that he was going to study in Botswana.  He said he is not going to stay in Botswana.  From Botswana he would go to Zimbabwe, he would go to Lusaka, he will go to Zambia.  \n After this letter arrived the police came.  Then the \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 R PHADI\npolice tortured my mother. Then they searched the house.  They say they heard that Japie is around.\n After that first visit they kept on coming to torture my mother.  They came again.  The next time they came with 16 vans.  Then they surrounded the house.  They kicked the doors and entered the house.  Two of my brothers were then arrested. It was George and Dumile.  George was 15 years at that time.  Dumile was 13 years old at the time.  They took them with them.  They tied them on the trees.  Then they beat them.  George cannot hear properly now and he\nwas mentally disturbed.  After that George died. In 1980 George became sick and died. After he passed away my mother became cardiac.\n The police were harrassing my mother all the time.  In 1982 my mother was still ill at the time, George passed away at Lorato Hospital.  On the day she died Japie came home.  When Japie arrived he didn't know that my mother had died.  He hid himself at my aunt's place in Kagiso.  He arrived after we had already buried my mother.  He arrived at dawn, round about three o'clock to my mother's grave. Then he threw a little stone.  He was not around during the funeral, he went to the tombstone to throw a stone.  After that he went to my aunt at Kagiso, to stay there.  \n When I went to give the statement I went to tell my cousin in Kagiso that because Japie is staying with them for a long time, they should tell me what is happening to Japie.  Then they told me that Japie was a member of the Pan Africanist Congress.  My cousin told me that at night they would go to places to plant bombs.  He told me again that Japie went all over the country.  He mentioned four countries.  He went to Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lusaka and \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 R PHADI\nZambia.  \n When I listened to my cousin because he had so much information. I want to request the Truth Commission to request my cousin to come and give evidence, because he was the one who was staying with him in 1982.  \n I request the Truth Commission to help us to look for Japie.  Even if he has died in a far place, they should bring the bones home.  I thank you.",

We know if you don't know the whereabouts of a person you become restless as to whether that person is alive or is dead.  We heard your requests.\nWe will ask our investigative unit to investigate this issue. They will talk to the PAC to find out where Japie is.  Unfortunately we cannot force people to come and give evidence, but we heard your request that we should call Paul to come and give his side of the story, as far as he knows about Japie.  We hope that your family and your cousin's families will reconcile, and that Japie's issue should not be the cause of the conflict.  We will do our best in investigating, so as to find out whether Japie has died or is still alive. If he has died we would like to know where he was buried.  When you are through we will ask our statement-takers to meet you so that this person sitting next to you, you can give him Paul's address, where he stays.  \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG",
