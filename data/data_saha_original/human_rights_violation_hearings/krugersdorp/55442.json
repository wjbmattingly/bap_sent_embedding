My mother just told me that we had just come to collect your corpse because we have heard that you passed away.  I just told my mother that it is all thanks to God that I am still alive.  \n On the 11th of June 1987 we were released from prison, but we were given certain conditions.

As they were checking the results of our torture Doctor Richardson told me that I will never be able to bear children again in my life due to this torturing by the policemen.  \n I washed my ears because they were constantly bleeding and during this cleansing process a cigarette stump was taken out.

We have heard what you have said about the policemen who were involved and that they are still present in some of our police stations.\n As we have done in previous hearings, we appeal to those policemen to come forward to come and tell their \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n12 B T MOGAPI\nstories or apply for amnesty and we hope we will be able to \ngive some of the answers to the questions that you are raising.
