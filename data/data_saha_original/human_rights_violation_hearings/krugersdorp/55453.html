<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Our next witness is Buka Pinzi.  Buka Pinzi.  I greet you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Good afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are we pronouncing your name the right way?  Are you Buka Pinzi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We welcome you.  We are going to hand over to Dr Randera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Pinzi, good afternoon and welcome.  Can you just stand to take the oath.  If you can just repeat after me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">BUKA PINZI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I will now hand over to Yasmin Sooka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you Joyce.  Mr Pinzi are you able to hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about yourself and what you did before this incident happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I was working at the mines.  That is when this whole thing happened and when it happened I could not go back to work.  So I lost my job.  That is how I am living at the present moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Do you want to tell us about what happened on the KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>2 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>night that you were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I was not present during the day, but we were told that it was going to happen the following morning.  When I was listening to the radio I heard that people at Swanieville should not patrol as they usually do because the police would be present to protect them so they should sleep peacefully.  As we were sitting, not having any hope because we could see that the other places were being attacked.  People were told to sleep and thereafter they would be attacked.  We did not sleep on that particular day.  We only slept at 2am in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a> Just as we were sleeping at round about five I heard some gunshot outside.  When I went outside to investigate I was shot.  I fell down and when I regained consciousness I ran away to Randfontein.  I got a chance to go to the hospital.  I do not know what happened at that moment because I never went back there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you very much.  I am going to ask you some questions so I can just make sure of what you are saying.  At the time when you were employed, which mine were you employed by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I was working at South Roodepoort Mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> You also mention that on that night you heard on the radio that you should not patrol as usual because the police were going to patrol the area.  Now, were you part of a group that went out every night to patrol the area and who were you patrolling the area against?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> We were patrolling so that when the Inkatha attack us, come to attack us they would find us aware because we would not know at what time they were going to come and attack us.  That is the way we lived because we</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>3 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>were told that the Inkatha was always threatening that they would be coming to attack us.  We could not sleep when other people were awake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So, where was, you mention that you were told.  Were these rumours that were going around Swanieville or had someone specifically told you that Inkatha was going to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> There is not a particular person who came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> One of the previous witnesses talked about the fact that there were two groups in Swanieville.  There was a group that was called The Men and a group that were called The Women and The Men told them that The Women, the group called The Women should patrol.  Were you part of any of these two groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, there was a group called The Men because the area was divided into two parts and it is still divided into two parts even now.  There is still The Men as well as The Women.  Whenever there was a patrol that was being conducted The Men would move from one area and they would be calling other members of the community.  That is The Men and they would not allow us to come out because they said we were women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> What did you understand, why were they making this distinction between the two groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> The difference was that the other group was very rude and callous in their dealings, but with us, because we liked negotiations we were referred to as women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> The Commissioner asked the previous witness and the one before him who also came from Swanieville about whether he knew what the problems were in Swanieville.  Were you aware of what the dispute was that was leading to what</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>4 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>eventually happened as the killings in Swanieville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I have got no knowledge because I was working and most of the time I was not present.  Up to this stage what I knew was that whenever the residents could not sleep I also could not sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you yourself renting your shack from Mr Swanepoel or were you renting it from someone else who was renting it from Mr Swanepoel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, Swanepoel had a small office where we had to pay our rent and that is where everybody else paid the rent.  These people were the ones who were taking the rent to Swanepoel because we use to get receipts from these people and I also paid at that office.  That is Swanepoel's office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Could you tell me on the night that you were shot, did you see the person that shot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I never saw the person who shot me because when I realised that I was bleeding, just as I was heading towards the gate, I heard some people talking behind me.  They were swearing at me telling me to stop and when I looked I saw some men with assegais as well as pangas.  That is when I started to run because I was not armed and I could not fight back so I decided to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> So did they shoot you from the back or were you shot from someone in the front because you mention that you were running away, but you were shot in your eye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I was shot whilst I was still inside my shack and when I went out I was shot already and I was bleeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did you yourself, Mr Pinzi, belong to any of the political structures in Swanieville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I was a member of a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Which one was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>5 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I was a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Can you tell me which hospital you were taken to after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I went by myself to Leratong Hospital when I got to Randfontein.  I took a taxi and it dropped me off at the hospital gate and the very same taxi was not coming straight because this road was blocked and the taxi had to take the Krugersdorp route.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And you mention that the bullet hit you on your right eye.  Can you tell us about the damage that was done to your eye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> It is not my right eye, it is my left eye.  My eye had to be taken out.  Even now my right eye is becoming effected and now it is because of the left eye.  I am becoming partially blind in the right eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Do you receive any kind of treatment for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> No, I am not getting any treatment because I do not have money to get treatment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Mr Pinzi, what we have learned is that there was a case which took place in the court in Johannesburg and that the seven men who were charged were then acquitted.  Were you ever told to go to court in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Because I moved from that area the very same moment, I never went back and I never heard about the case.  I have only just come back now because the place has now been changed.  I never went back at that time.  It is only the first time that I hear that there was a case because I moved as from that day when I was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Did you yourself never lay a charge against anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> No, I never reported the matter because I did not KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>6 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>know who shot me and I knew that if I did not know the identity of the person, there was absolutely no help that I could get.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Thank you.  I have no more questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> What I did, I went to report my fridge that they took because I was still paying for my fridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Piet Meiring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Could you tell me what actually happened about the fridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I reported the matter to Ellerines and they said I should report it to the police station.  I got an affidavit and I returned it to Ellerines and they asked me whether I wanted another fridge.  I said I do not want another fridge because I would not be able to pay it as I had been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> When you reported the fridge did you not mention anything about your eye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I told them that I would not be able to pay the fridge because I was injured and I could not go on working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> No, Mr Pinzi.  I am asking that when you went to the police to make the affidavit about the fridge, did you tell the police about what happened to your eye?  Did you report it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I reported the matter.  I told the police about my eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And did they do anything about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> They did nothing.  They just gave me the affidavit to take to Ellerines and that is all they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Piet Meiring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Mr Pinzi I would like to ask a few questions</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>7 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>about your own personal circumstances at the moment.  I would like to ask a few questions about your.  Mr Pinzi I would like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am trying to switch it off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> There you are.  Mr Pinzi, I need to ask you a number of questions about your own personal circumstances if you do not mind.  The first thing I would like to ask is, are you married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I was married, but we are now separated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Were you married when this thing happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I was married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Are there children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I do have kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> How many children do you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I have four kids.  One is 12, the other one is eight years, the third one is five years and the other one is two years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> And are they in your care?  Do you have to pay for their schooling and for all the other things they need?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, I am the one who provides for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Are they living with you or are they living with their mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> They stay with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you and you are not employed at the moment or are you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> No, I am not employed at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Excuse me for asking the question, but where do you find money to care for the children, to pay for their school and for all the other things they need?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>8 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> At times I sell, there are certain things that I sell and whatever money that I get from my sales I put it aside for my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">PROF MEIRING:</span> Thank you very much.  Those were my questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dr Randera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Pinzi, just tell me, I know your eye had been injured at the time, but the other two people who came before us today talked about the IFP people being protected by the police.  Did you see any of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I was so injured and there was absolutely no way for me to have noticed anything of that sort because when I was from Swanieville, I was running for my life.  It was so cold and I just had no time to sit around and look what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> I understand.  I just want to come back to this group called The Men and The Women.  Were they all members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I think, according to my own observations, I thought that would probably be the case, but at some stage I thought there was a difference between the two groups.  I was not very, very sure because of the way that they conducted this whole thing.  I ended up believing that we were not all members of the ANC because I believed we would be called and we would address the issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Now you said you were patrolling.  You were part of the group that was patrolling every night.  For how many nights were people patrolling before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> The rule in Swanieville was that when Swanieville was established in 1989.  We started patrolling in 1990 or 1991.  That is when the patrol thing started because other</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>KRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>9 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>areas had been attacked.  So we decided that we should protect our own area.  That was from 1991, but I am not sure as to which month we started patrolling.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Mr Pinzi, I just want to understand.  You said the night before the attack you had listened to the radio and there had been a message that the police were protecting.  There was nothing to be frightened about and therefore, although you went to sleep at two o' clock in the morning, the patrol seemed to have taken that as an understanding.  Now, are we to understand that in that atmosphere in 1991, people actually trusted what the police were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> I do not understand the question.  It is quite long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Okay.  Sorry, let me come back.  You said that you had heard on the radio that it was not necessary to patrol.  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> And that was coming from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> What I am asking is that were people trusting the police at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> At the time the police were not trusted by the residents.  It was so, so.  It was not really a situation where you could vouch and say they were trusted by the residents, but at the time even when we watched TV we could see that when two groups are fighting, that is Inkatha and the ANC, you could see that the police were much more aligned to the Inkatha than the ANC.  We realised that the police were our enemies.  That is why that during the night I did not sleep, I slept at 2am.</p>

<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>10 B PINZI</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> My last question is related to your fridge.  I thought I had heard you say earlier on that you did not go back to Swanieville after you had been shot.  When you went to the police station who were you saying had stolen your fridge or how did you find out that your fridge had been stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> There are certain youths who I was staying with at the house and they were left uninjured when I ran away.  They went back, they discovered the fridge had been taken or stolen and they told me whilst I was at the hospital that the fridge was stolen.  That is when I decided to go to Ellerines and they said I should report the matter to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">DR RANDERA:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yasmin Sooka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Mr Pinzi, I am sorry to come back to this question of these two groups, The Men and the Women.  I want to understand properly when these two groups started.  How long were you yourself living in Swanieville before this incident happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> These groups started when the place had grown bigger.  That is when people started arriving and staying in Swanieville.  That is when this demarcation started.  At first the place did not have any political groups or any groups whatsoever because the people were not so many when I arrived in Swanieville.  When the place grew bigger and bigger there was a difference between the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And what was this difference based on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Everytime when there were meetings that we convened, the people who regarded themselves as The Men use to come to our side or to our area and dictate terms to us</p>

<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>and tell us that there was going to be a meeting held.  I did not understand who actually was the leader of that particular group.  Even at the meeting when the meeting was being addressed they were very dominating, those who called themselves The Men.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> And who were these meetings called by?  Were they called by the ANC structure in the township or by the Civics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> At that time I was not politically aware and I did not care much about what was happening around me.  I just regarded myself as an equal with other people and I was very much in need of a place to stay.  I did not want to get involved in the politics of the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were there fights between the two groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> No, I have never heard of any fights.  I have never seen any.  I would not know, maybe when I was not around it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Were you on the same side acting against Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> What do you mean when you I was part of the group that was opposed to Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> I am asking, you see, you are saying that there were two groups and the one group use to be killed The Men and the one group was called The Women, but when Inkatha attacked Swanieville, would you say that the group, The Men and The Women were on the same side against Inkatha or was one of those groups acting with Inkatha or were they both just targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> On that particular day I do not remember whether there was anyone who was actually fighting with the other because we were woken up by sounds of gunfire and I did not really notice whether that was ANC and Inkatha or what was</p>

<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MS SOOKA:</span> Yes, I think that we note that point then.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Pinzi, I am going to ask you just one question.  When you say you heard over the radio an announcement that you should not patrol the area, you must sleep soundly because the police were there to protect you.  Do you think that was some form of mechanism to make you sleep so that you could be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> Yes, that is how I think of it because we did not sleep the whole night and immediately when I tried to sleep we got attacked.  I think that was a plan in order for them to attack us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the police come to patrol the area as promised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> The police presence was that they were moving up and down and they were doing nothing.  They were there at seven up to eight, up till nine.  Then by the time I slept the Hippo was no longer there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, this plan to make you sleep, according to your own opinion, do you think the police were working hand in hand with these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> That is how I see it.  I think they were working together hand in glove.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you very much that you have appeared before this Commission.  Is there anything else that you would like to say or maybe a request that you want to put forward to this Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> If there is any help that the Truth Commission could offer me.  I want to get some work so that I can be</p>

<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about your eyes?  Can you see or do you feel that they are perfectly healed?  Is there any other help that you need with regard to the treatment of your eye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PINZI:</span> My other injured eye was taken out, but the one that is left is partially blind especially when it is very sunny or windy.  It gives me problems.  I do need help with regard to the remaining eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We hope that we will be able to pass forward your requests and see what help you can get with regard to your requests and we shall get back to you in due course.  Thank you very much.</p>
