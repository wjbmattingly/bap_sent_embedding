            "At my home we were six.  My elder brother as\nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 D B MOSHANI\nwell as my sister and my mother.  He is the one who was working at that time at the Randfontein mine.  At the time I was still looking for a job.  Then in November 1985 my brother came to me in Mohlakeng location and he told me that I should go home and I wanted to know from him as to how I should go back because my wife at the time was working.  He said to me there were riots and boycotts so I should go back home.  He offered my money, but I did not got, but at the end of November, it was about the 30th.  He gave me some more money to go back home.  He told me that if I did not want to go back home, he would go home himself.  Then I told my wife that my brother said I should go home and I left my children with my wife.  I stayed for about a week at home.\n On the second week of my stay I just had a gut feeling that I should not run my usual road work because I was also doing road work.  Then during the week my uncle came.  He had come to tell us bad news, that my brother had died and I wanted to find out as to what had happened.  He told me that there was a meeting at the Carletonville mine and when they went back to the compound to address a certain meeting that was going to be held.  According to his statement he told me that when this meeting was being addressed there were certain people who were calling for the closure of a certain bottle store which was built within the mine.  As they were still talking and marching outside to the bottle store, there is a certain white person by the name of Piet Rademeyer as well as policemen who came.  They accosted my brother and the rest of the group.  \n Apparently an argument took place that led to him having a fight with a white policeman.  My brother was apparently fighting for the policeman's gun.  There was a \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 D B MOSHANI\ncertain car that appeared and it him the white person and Rademeyer gave orders that my brother should be shot.  He was shot on the spot.  \n As I have come before this Commission it is because my brother had been shot and I was not working at that time.  My brother was working.  He is the one who was the breadwinner and he was looking after the family.  He also has children with different women and I was supporting the children when I was still working.  Now that he is deceased I came back to look for a job in Johannesburg and I, ultimately, got a job in Randfontein.  When I got this job in Randfontein I was playing sports.  I played rugby in particular and I got injured, my spinal column in 1991.  I was taken to the mine hospital where I was admitted and ever since then I have been in and out of the hospital.  There was no particular treatment that they gave me except rubbing stuff and they treated me with some ice tubes.\n I went to a certain Dr Morula who conducted an X-ray and told me that I should undergo an operation.  I was sent to Lesedi Private Clinic to undergo the operation.  When I came back from the operation I was no longer fit to work in that particular department because now my health had changed and my health status was not satisfactory.  The mine staff or the mine personnel dismissed me because they said there was no longer a job for me.  Now I want this Commission to investigate as to why Rademeyer shot my brother because today I have got my own kids, but I cannot send money home because I am not working.  My wife is working.  My story is as short as that.",
