            "In 1991 on the 19th of March about 12 midnight.  We could not sleep with my husband.  Whilst we were sitting there, me and my husband on that night, we heard the gate, the gate chain was making a noise and I told my husband that somebody is trying to open the gate.  He said no it is not our gate.  He said it is from the neighbours.  Whilst I was listening to that I told him it is our gate.  He said no it is not.\n At quarter to one he went outside and I told him that he must check the gate, if it is locked.  He came back, he \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 N A NOMANDLA\nfound that the chain was unlocked, but he said he could see no one outside.  When he tried to sleep he heard somebody breaking the window.  I told him the window is breaking.  He said, no it is not our window.  We woke up, we heard somebody had a newborn baby in the next room.  She was carrying the baby naked in her hands.  She was standing in the front room.  I went into the childrens room and took them out through the window.  The other one was standing next to the dining room.  I asked her why does she not go out.  She said she is scared because Mr Gaai is standing next to the door.\n When I opened the door he ran away, Gaai.  He hid behind the grapes.  At that time the house was on fire.  I took her out.  She was scared to run away and she stood next out next to the door.  Her father went out as well via the kitchen door trying to chase these people in order to fight with them.  I used the front door to go out and that is where I met Morris Masingyetza and I fought with him.  Whilst I was fighting with Morris Masingyetza, Thomas Mvudle pushed me and hit me with a fist.  That is where I lost my three teeth.  \n When I went to the house their father ran outside next to the house trying to find the girl who had a baby in her hands.  I tried to do the same as well.  I stood on the verandah.  I was standing next to Thomas Kunene and Tony Tshabalala told Thomas that he said shoot and Thomas Munene did not shoot.  He just dropped his handgun and Tony Tshabalala grabbed the gun and shot one shot and I retreated.  He shot the second shot and that him on his left shoulder.  It went through and it came through his left breast.  When he fell down I went back into the house and I \nKRUGERSDORP HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 N A NOMANDLA\nclosed the door.  They shot the door.  As to who shot, I did not see.  I went back into the house and he was still lying outside.  \n Whilst I was in the house I saw my brother going into his house.  They had grabbed him as well.  The people who were in the yard, there were six.  They were seven, but I do not know the seventh one, but I know the six in full.  It was Tony Tshabalala, Gahiema Seko, Morris Masinyetza, Thomas Mvudle, Thomas Munene and Kitis Scosco.\n Having left just a few minutes Thomas Nkonza arrived.  He came inside the house and I was standing with my daughter.  He said what has burnt down here.  I can refund in five minutes.  I told him he must not commit himself because he does not know what happened.  I asked him, do you know what happened.  He did not answer me, he just left.  Just ten minutes after he had left policemen arrived.  The policmen took me and my daughter to the police station and they took a statement.  We came back and we had a hash with us and it took my husband away.",

We, as part of our work, as part of the Human Rights Violations Committee need to make further investigation on what you have told us before we can decide whether you are a victim.  Once that is done your name will be forwarded to the Reparations Committee, but let me say and, I think it is a very important question that you have raised, that we will be waiting on Government finally to decide on this reparation policy.
