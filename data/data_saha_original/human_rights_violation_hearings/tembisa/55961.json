            "I was arrested in 1976.  I was a young student involved in the boycott of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in Black schools.  I was arrested in November 1976.  I was taken to Rabasoto by three policemen, two\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 R MALIBE\nWhites and one Black policemen.  The two White policemen were in camouflage uniform, the uniform worn by the soldiers.  We were beaten.  I was with a friend when we were arrested.  We were beaten up with fists, slapped, kicked.  However, we managed to lie our way through and we were released after a brutal torture on that particular day.  \n Then again I was re-arrested in 1977 where the gruesome torture took place.  I think it was somewhere in September if I am not mistaken.  One of my friends had skipped the country and because I was no longer sleeping at home I would come just to have my supper and go to my hiding place.  On that day they came earlier than usual, at around sixish, it was at about six, they got me.  When they took me home they put me in the car with them.  There were two White policemen, and when we reached the corner in my street they put me in the boot of the car.  They brought me to Rabasoto Hall.  When we got at Rabasoto we didn't go to the charge office, we came round and then we went to the first floor.  It's a small room.  They told me to take off my clothes.  I undressed.  They took me to a shower.  After that they handcuffed me behind my back. They started interrogating me about my activities at school and why we were resisting to be taught in Afrikaans.  They used their flamboyant language when I answered them, \"kak\".  \n They started beating me.  Beating me on the face with their fists.  Slapped me on the ears from time-to-time.  As I was naked then they beat me with the sjambok all over the body.  I started bleeding and they beat me on the toes with the sjambok, the toes now.  \n Thereafter the question would come in the same manner and when I answered them they used their vulgaric language, \nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n3 R MALIBE\nand once they say \"kak\" you'd know that they had come for you.  They used a canvas sack-like, you know put on my face.  They wet it first and then they put it on my face and then covered it on the bottom.  I would be unable to breathe.  Eventually I suffocated and urinated on the floor.  When they realised that I was just becoming unconscious they took it off and asked me whether I was ready to tell the truth.  I told them what I told them.  \n The beating continued just like that for many days that came.  The worst part that I could not just forget is when they locked me into the strongroom.  They have a strongroom.  They put me in this strongroom.  I believe I was there for three nights.  I would say three nights because during the day I would hear people passing by and I would assume it's night because it would be very quiet.  At that time I was naked and my hands were still handcuffed.  Before they took me into the strongroom he actually, this White guy, probably it's the Coetzee, he tightened the handcuffs on my arms and I told him that they are too tight.  He used his language again, the \"kak\".  Then they threw me in there.\n After three nights he came, probably he was looking for something because when he opened the door, the strongroom door, he got scared of what he was seeing.  Then he started punching me violently.  Okay.  They took me out again and continued with their torture.  While I was there they brought in some Indian guys.  They were Police I presume.  The senior Police who was in charge ordered them to beat me, and it was funny because it was like they were practising karate on me.  They were kicking me, standing like that with my hands behind my back.  Kicking me on the body, then punching me.  And he would say \"Moor hom, moor hom\", you\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n4 R MALIBE\nknow just like that, as if he was in a trance.  Eventually I fell down and then he took the sjambok and just beat me all over.\n Then they left me there.  After three to four days they would come back, and I think it was the seventh day I was very hungry I had no food you know.  They left me in that small room, here at Rabasoto, so I would just crawl into the toilet and drink from the toilet sink.",

            "When they came that following night they were drinking coffee and these koeksusters. The junior of these White guys said to me, \"is jy honger\"?  I did not answer.  He said you have been here for several days you should be hungry.  \"Soek jy die missus' se koffie?\"  They had their flasks.  So on the windowsill there was a cup for coffee that they were using to put cigarette butts and cigarette ash you know, he took that, did not even wash it with the cigarette butts and the ash he poured the coffee there and said to me \"drink die missus' se koffie\" and then he gave me those koeksusters.  I had no choice.  I drank and ate that poison.\n On that particular night they took me to their girlfriends.  I don't know where that was because every time when they transported me they put me in the boot.  They were playing Radio 5 for me in the boot.  When we got there I was bleeding on my back because they used the sjambok to beat me on the body and ears and I realised that I was bleeding through my ears.  When we got there they called their girlfriends they came out and they took me out of the boot. They said \"hy is een van die terrorist, ons het hom gevang\". Well one of the ladies could not look at the sight of me.  \nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n5 R MALIBE\nShe went back and the other one they hugged, they other couple just stood there and hugged in front of me.  And that was the situation that I was faced with.\n The other part that I nearly left out is that during this interrogation there were severe moments.  I remember at one stage he wanted the information about a certain guy who stayed next to my place, Brunsa, ja Brunsa.  He just wanted Brunsa very much.  He said that was the biggest terrorist he wants.  And then I could not give them an answer.  I knew Brunsa but he was not a friend to me and we are not close associates, so he started hitting me, pulled me by my private parts, the penis especially, then realising that I was not answering him well then he used a plier. He pulled me using the plier and then started nipping my testes with the plier.  There was nothing that I could give him except that.  Then eventually - that was continual, it would happen, they would come and go until I think 1981 when this harassment subsided.  However, I could not take it out of my mind.  Every time I see people testifying on television about the torture they have suffered at the hands of Police and that they were stripped naked I knew exactly what happened to those people.  That's how far I remember my statement.",

So they threatened me that if I can just disappear they will actually take my family and I saw that they have that capability.  Because I remember they even promised me to work for them.  They actually tried to bribe me that they will provide me with a temporary job as I was a student then.  This probably it's the Coetzee the senior policeman who was in charge, he even gave me R25,00 that if I see any of the former students and anyone who has left the country is back, I should report to them.

We are the pinnacle of teaching, and I think if we, not necessarily conscietise the students, but make them aware of the political situation, despite that we have a democracy in place the political situation they have to know what is happening you know in their lives.  I think teachers who are the ones to assist in that role.  We have a very, very important role to play.  Like for instance let me just elaborate a little bit, like for instance right now in Tembisa is engulfed by misunderstanding between the councillors and the residents in general.  We as teachers we have to tell our students why we should pay rent or not pay rent.  Our students have to understand and go back and tell their parents who are semi-literate, and some absolutely illiterate, the reasons behind this.",

I think we are struck by the generosity which you extend to those who have done this to you, that both you and the witness who testified this morning indicated that a special day should be set up where both perpetrators and victims can come together.  It is very important I think in our country for us to see and end-goal, and while no one can force us to forgive there is a generosity that the country has extended to those who have committed these acts in the granting of amnesty, if they come forward and they make full disclosure so that at least we can learn about all that they have done.  Unfortunately although we have received more than 3,000 applications we have still not received the applications of those who were in fact the authors of the kind of violence that took place and we urge people to make use of this opportunity.  You yourself have in fact survived the '76 riots.  You have survived the State of Emergency and today you are in fact a teacher and someone who has an influence on the young minds that we are cultivating in this country which we hope will have a future which is free of the kind of violence which all of us grew up under.\n We thank you for your courage, and we thank you for coming today to share that with us.
