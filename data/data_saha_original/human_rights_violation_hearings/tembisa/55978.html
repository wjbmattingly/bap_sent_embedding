<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> We would like to welcome you and thank you for coming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">RACHEL KUNA PHALANE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Ms Phalane I will lead your evidence.  You are in fact going to tell us both about your husband and your son in two separate incidents that took place firstly in May 1993 and then in August 1993.  If you could please feel relaxed.  You are here amongst friends.  If you could please in your own time tell us your story.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> On the 9th of May 1993 there was a boy who belonged to the Toaster group who was staying in Vusumuzi.  They passed through at about 1 o'clock.  They passed by towards the graveyard to bury this boy, and when they came back a gentleman from Tafene passed by saying that go into the houses these people are coming back and they are destroying windows on their way back.  We did that.  We ran into the houses.  They came down breaking windows. As we were in the houses they passed by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a> After having passed by we went out again.   When we went out we met policemen who were loading Inkatha members onto their casper, and then we heard some women shouting that they killed my husband.  We went there and we found that he was lying there.  When we got there he was shot twice in front of him forehead and he was stabbed with a sword in his heart.  And then a police van came and took him to Rabasotho and I didn't lay a charge because I wouldn't go TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>2 PHALANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>to my enemies.  Because I realised that the Inkatha members were being used by the White men. After these they would be loaded again by the policemen. That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Could you tell us who was this person that you saw who had been killed, was that your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And his name was Temba Khosi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> What happened after that, I mean did you bury him?  Was he amongst other people who had been killed, you buried him alone?  Oh, sorry I asked what happened after you had found his body, did you then bury him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> From the way you describe this it looks as though it was again one of those killings without any reason, do you think that's the case or do you think there might have been a reason for why they attacked your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> My husband was a member of the ANC.   I think that is the reason why they killed him, because of his ANC membership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> How would they have known that he was a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> That is how I see because they knew us because most of them were staying at Tafene and it's near the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Can you hear, is that better?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes it's much better.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Thank you.  I was just trying to find out why your husband himself should have been attacked.  If we could just wait please while the headphones are sorted out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> That's better.  Yes I can hear you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>3 PHALANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> What I am just trying to find out about is why they should attack your husband specifically or was it just part of a general attack on people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> It is because on that particular day everybody was running away, including ourselves.  They were not targeting him specifically.  They were attacking everybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And the person that you mentioned who had died, or whose funeral that they were coming back from, that was Yster was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> It's Yster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> You named him as being a member of the Toasters, can you explain about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> We used to hear that there was this boy from Ntombeka section and he ran away and lived in Vusumuzi Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Was he IFP or was he just a member of the Toasters, how would you identify him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> He was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Can you now tell us please about the incident that took place in August, also in 1993, involving your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> There is a neighbour who heard a ceremony of an unveiling of a tombstone.   In the morning, round about 6:20 we heard some gunshots.  This went on for some time. It started in Mtumbeka section and then they came to Tafene section.  That was at about 6:20.  As we were attending this ceremony twins came in and this boy came to say that they have shot our house and he said they shot the next door house and ourselves and they have killed people.  I wanted to know who did they kill?  He was just crying, he couldn't respond.  We went up there and we met these people who did this.  They were accompanied by White policemen who was</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>4 PHALANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>giving them a lift in their caspers.  Truly when I got to my next-door neighbour I found my child lying there dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And he was there with the other neighbours, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I left these children at home, I realised that maybe myself being scared to sleep alone and they decided to go and sleep over at my neighbour's house and that is when these people came to attack.  They didn't even leave my house, they also broke my windows as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And why do you think that they attacked in that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> I mean do you think that this was a follow-up to the attack in which your husband was killed in May, three months before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And what happened to Ronald, was he the only one who was actually killed that night, your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> In Tafene section on that day it might have been three people that they killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Were all of them killed next door at your neighbour's or in other places as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> They were just killing randomly in all areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And again do you know who the people were who were carrying out these killings, can you identify them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> No I don't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> You have no description of, or no idea who they were or where they came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I think it is Inkatha because they were accompanied by the police because after this attack they were given a lift by the police in their caspers and they</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>5 PHALANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>would drop them at Umfuleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> So this is again a question of people being loaded into the caspers, did you actually see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes I saw that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> And again you didn't report the case because, as you say you regarded these people as your enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Hlengiwe do you have questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Mrs Phalane the death of your husband, when people talk how did they describe this man Yster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yster was a criminal in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Can you explain about his criminal activities if you know? What was he known of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I can't explain what kind of a criminal he was, but from rumours I heard that he was a criminal, I can't explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> In your statement you stated that those people who destroyed and killed your husband when coming from the funeral did you know how he was killed, Yster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> No I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Can you briefly explain to us you said your husband was killed because he was an ANC member, how was it possible that they could identify members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I think they knew that he was an ANC member from the beginning.  Why I say this is because we are staying next to IFP people and most of the time they used to scold him and say you will pay for being a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> What involvement - they could see in which language he can speak, did he do anything, did he have any leadership problem within the community, because some people TEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>6 PHALANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>might speak Xhosa but they might not be ANC, or they might speak Zulu not being Inkatha members, that's why we are asking what was he exactly doing within the community to show that he is an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> He was a section committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Your child you described, how old was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> He was nine years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> When you found him how was he killed, did he have some wounds or what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I didn't hear you well.   They way he was shot it seemed as though he wasn't shot with bullets.  It was like bullets which have got some salts which can stick on the body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Rachel you said that your son, the person who attacked and killed him was Amber, was this Amber a policeman or just an ordinary citizen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> He was just an ordinary citizen, and he was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Who saw him attacking the house which led to the death of your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> He was seen by my neighbour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Is Amber still around within the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> He's staying at Vusumuzi.  Whether he is still there or not now I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> When you say he was seen by your neighbours, which one, the neighbours who were just before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Lizo told us that his parents didn't say anything because his parents were in hiding, he was the only one who was shouting after he was shot, how could he have seen that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>7 PHALANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> When I arrived in the morning my neighbour told me that her husband woke her up and told her that the Inkatha people are coming and when she woke up and she peeped through the window she saw them.  She said the only person that she recognised was Amber.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> What time was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> It was 6:20 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Was it visible that you can see a person coming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> From your neighbours did they tell you exactly why the Inkatha people were attacking them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> They way they explained was that they were looking for their brother to go and stay in Vusumuzi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> When you say the brother is Amber from the Sokale family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> Yes that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Where is Mrs Sokale at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> You mean my neighbour? We left him at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS MKHIZE:</span> Didn't he like to come before the Commission to give his view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> Mrs Phalane could I just ask one final question because your case is something that strengthens all of us, the way that you have survived this double loss, both your husband and your son being killed in this way, how do you feel now, yourself about the situation, has the situation improved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS PHALANE:</span> I am hurt and I have got high blood pressure at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEWIN:</span> How do you feel, are there things that you feel</p>

We would all like to pay tribute to the way in which you have carried on with your life in the face of such losses which must be so painful for you.  What we will try and do is investigate the reasons, try and find out what exactly happened, why it happened.  </p>
