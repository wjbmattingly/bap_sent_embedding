The story that you tell is a very painful one and we can well understand your reluctance or the pain that it brings and the suffering that you are still experiencing.  I think we would like to thank you for coming.  It is not an easy thing to do and what you have done this morning is very brave.  So we would like to\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n7 MABHENA\nsalute you for that.\n We will as Commissioner Hlengiwe Mkhize has suggested, we would suggest that you look at the possibility or ask at the clinic the possibility of getting counselling because what you are wrestling with yourself is something that is very difficult, because you have suffered physical pain.  Your brother has died, but you are now suffering the psychological pain of that.  It is easy for us to say yes, your brother died in the struggle but so many other people died and his life was part of that struggle, it's very easy to say that and to recognise that, but then you the family still stay behind and have to bear the pain and keep alive, keep living.  You also have the responsibility for your mother.  So we express our solidarity with you, urge you to have strength and to seek assistance.  We will investigate the case and come back to you.  Thank you very much for coming.  That was a big step by you today.  Thank you.",
