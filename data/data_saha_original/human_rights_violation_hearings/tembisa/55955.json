The house was a newly-built house, it didn't have burglar proofing.  Outside I heard gunshots.  I was dreaming of people\nTEMBISA HEARING TRC/GAUTENG\n2 HOBOYI\nshooting.  However I didn't worry myself about the gunshots.  However, after when the windows were broken in the house we were sleeping in I woke up and I met this one person who was facing me.  I found that there was nothing that I can do and I decided to run away.  As I was jumping he hit me.  I was still in the air when he shot me.  I tried to move but I couldn't.  I tried to pretend as if I am dead and the gunshots continued.  I thought they would leave the place but they continued shooting and I didn't move, I just slept on the ground.\n I just saw the door was open by then.  I didn't know who opened the door, but what I heard is that one of the twins who ran away came to open the door. The other one was killed in the house.  After they have left the place I started calling my mother.  They were in the bedroom.  My mother told me to come to the bedroom.  I told her that I can't move because I've been hit.  She couldn't hear well because we were all shouting, calling me.  I told her again that I can't walk because they shot me. Then they came and took me and put me on the bed and my dad went out to look for transport.  He came back with the transport and they took me to hospital.  I stayed in hospital for four days.  The doctor came to me and asked whether I could walk and I said to him yes I can, but I was lying. He said to me you can leave and then I walked, tried to walk.  Then the next day I went home because I didn't like staying in the hospital.\n I didn't stay at Tafene, I went to stay with my other mother somewhere.  That's where I stop.",

We would like to thank you very much for coming forward today.  This is part of the scene that we hope is beginning to quieten down now, of this antagonism and violence between the hostel people and the township residents.  It's clearly a battle that has caused immense grief in the whole place.  A large number of people have been attacked and like yourself injured and it must be very hard for you now not to be able to play soccer and to take part in sport as other students would do.  We would urge you to see if there is more that can be done.  We will investigate that ourselves to see if you can be helped. If there are other people who know about this incident or who have further information about it we would also issue an appeal to them to come forward and to help.\n We would like to thank you and thank your mother for coming to join you.  Thank you very much for being with us today.  Thank you.",
