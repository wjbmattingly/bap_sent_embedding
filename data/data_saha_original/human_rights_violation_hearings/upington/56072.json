            " There was a meeting at school.  The comrades had called the meeting.  We then went there.  When we got there it was packed with people.  Steven Mgezwa was called out to pray.  He prayed.  When he said amen there was a hippo that came.  The police said, they said we must disperse.  They had sjamboks in their hands.  People ran away, going towards the fence, I then fell.  They beat me first before I fell.  After they beat me I fell.  A lady called Ms Nel then helped me up.  We struggled until we're outside.  I got out and ran.  There were two police ahead of me, running.  I then ran and went to a house, Magade's house.  When I got there I got a glass of water, water with sugar.  I drank that water.  The police went running after people, using teargas.  People were running away.  I stayed in that house but eventually I went home with Ms Magade.  There was no unrest at that time.  When I got home I heard the hippo again, approaching my house.  I got up, the police came and asked me where my son is.  I said I do not know.  They said I do know.  They then left.  In the evening we were sleeping, five policemen came.  They knocked on the door.  I asked who's there, they said it is them, the police.  I opened the door.  As I opened the door, the one grabbed me to come closer to him.  They then asked again where my son was.  I said I do not know.  The others were already inside the house.  The continued asking.  I insisted that I do not know.  They were armed.  It was terrible.  That was a terrible day.  They left, they left.  I had no rest in my heart, they were searching for my child.  I was up and down in the location looking for my child.  I was hurting so much.  I never found my child.  I went to the comrades, I asked them where my son was.  They said the last time they had seen him was the previous day.  That was the last time I saw my child.  To this very day I want my child.  I need help.  There is no direction.  I am asking to this day, I have no strength, I do not know what to do but if I would see my child today in front of me, face to face, I would have peace in my heart.  I would have peace in my heart.  My children are still hurting as well.  I wrote a letter, writing to my son's mother, the mother said such a thing has never happened before.  All the time you took my child as a baby, how can he just disappear now?  I have never spent any time with my child.  I sought him and sought him out, I did not get my child.  I have no one with me, I am ill of health.  I continued to look for my child.  I continue even now to look for my child.  Even if he did, even if he is still alive, even if he is working somewhere, I just want to know.  I just want to know.  That is all I have to say.",

There are two things that bring so much pain in your story, that those who have hurt you did not even consider that you are a senior person.  They did not even say here is an elderly lady even though we are beating other people up, perhaps this senior person we should not.  This just goes to show that they did not see black people as people.  They did not differentiate between mothers and elderly people.  It was just black people and in the midst of all that your son still disappears.  It would be better perhaps if you knew that perhaps my son has died.  Now you don't know whether he has died, whether he is still alive, where is he, whatever happened to him?  The President Mandela has given us a job, a responsibility to help people such as you, to get answers for your questions.  We will try as much as we can.  Maybe we can get some answers.
