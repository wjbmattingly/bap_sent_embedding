I was arrested by the police of the former Boputhatswana government, because he had a T-shirt with Kotsilibone's picture on him and he was home from a meeting.  And he told me that the people who arrested him, were in a private vehicle.  After this vehicle spotted him, the small car reversed and parked near him, where they put him in the car and took him to the police station.\n At the police station they put him in another room and they pointed at him with a gun and they said this is your mother.  They hit him with the gun butt and he was swollen on his face.  He even had a wound.  And then he went to a doctor and the doctor certified that he had been beaten on his heart, because thereafter he used to fall down, even at work.  \n One day when I came back from work, I found him laying dead.  Sometimes he would be taken to the doctor during the afternoon whilst I was still not at home.  And that day when I came back from work, I found him lying dead.  I arranged for a funeral.",
