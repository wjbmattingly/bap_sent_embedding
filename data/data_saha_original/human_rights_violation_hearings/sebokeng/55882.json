            "It was in 1991 in March, I can't remember the date very well.  In 1991 in March when my son disappeared, his name is Papiki Matseletsele.  He was 18 years old at that time.  I realised that he belonged to the PAC organisation.  The first thing that we did we heard that they had their leaders within the township.  The first person that we went to to trace him because we had already\nHRV/799 heard/...\n2\nheard that there might be a possibility that he had skipped the country.  We went to a certain Mr Tenane in Zone 13 and we asked him as to whether can he shed any light about our boy.  And he said no, he didn't know anything.  Surprisingly enough on the day that Lehole disappeared, we had a telephone at home at that time, Mr Tenane called our home looking for Papiki.  My sister picked up the telephone and Mr Tenane identified himself and he said he wanted to speak to Papiki.  After that Papiki conversed with him on the telephone we don't know what were they talking.  That was the last day we saw him as his mother .  Papiki left me with R5,00 and a photo written the prayer, the Lord's Prayer.   From there when we realised that Mr Tenane was not helping us in any way my uncle Mr Peki Mulau went to the offices of the PAC in Johannesburg.  He had Papiki's photo with him.  He enquired about his whereabouts and they said they don't know anything about Papiki.  We lost hope and then we went to his friends, we asked anybody we came across about his whereabouts and we were told that Papiki indicated at one stage that he wanted to be a soldier.  His uncle used to frequent the PAC offices and every time he would go to the offices he would be given the same message that we do not know him, until in March 1994.\n It was on a Wednesday, 9 of March 1994 as I have mentioned, it was at about 2 o'clock.  A person came home, a gentleman, and he had a paper in his hand and he said it was a list of names and he identified himself as Mr Tulo, and he said he was from the PAC offices in Johannesburg.  But he said nobody sent him, he wasn't officially sent to our home, he said he was working and as he was fiddling with the documents he came across a paper and he saw this \nHRV/799 Matseletsele/...\n3\nMatseletsele surname and he remembered that he knew Mulua\nwho is my brother, the uncle to the person who disappeared, because he knew the surname and then he knew exactly where Mulua was.  And he came and he said to us I am here on my behalf, I am not representing the organisation, nobody sent me here.  Because we were alert at all times Mulua said to him I don't know how to take your issue, do I have to believe you or not?  We have been to your offices many times but many times were told that he is not known, and you are here today from the offices.  Please write your story on the paper and sign.  And it's true, he took a paper, he wrote everything down and he signed.  And he said he was here to report that on the 7th Papiki was involved in a car accident in Dar es Salaam and Papiki died.  \n On that same day, on the 9th Mulua went to Mr Tenane and Mr Tenane refused any information.  But he said I will call the offices and I will call Dar es Salaam.  Nothing took place. The next day, it was on the 10th of March Mr Tenane came to our home and he said to us the telephones in Dar es Salaam are not working.  They only operate during the day and he said Mulua has to accompany him to his home to wait for the telephone from Dar es Salaam and the two of them left.  It was in the morning.  It was just after nine.  They spent the whole time at Mr Tenane's house till 11 o'clock, no message, nothing.  \n Mulua came back and he said I am not going to keep this a secret.  He left for the PAC offices in Johannesburg and he reported the matter to them.  When he arrived they told him that they are busy as the organisation because they were heading for the elections but they will try their best.  Mulua came back, they gave him another date to go and \nHRV/799 consult/...\n4\nconsult with them.  The person who used to go was Mulua and my mother and another relative of ours.  \n When they arrived in Johannesburg - let me go back a while.  When Tenane arrived he didn't acknowledge the fact that the deceased was buried on the 7th.  And then we decided to go to the offices to ask them to transport the corpse here so that we can bury it ourselves but our request was not listened to.  On several occasions we have been to the offices and they would continually tell us the same story.  The statement that they gave us was they cannot keep him for a long time because he was already decomposed, and he was so tall that he couldn't fit in the coffin, or in the drawers at the mortuary.",

            "The authorities at the offices didn't take any initiative to consult us.  We were actually following them.  They continually gave us dates to go and consult with them.  And they said to us they will need an amount of R6 000 to transport the corpse to South Africa.  That is true.  We tried to gather the money.  Once more we went to the offices requesting just one thing our son to be brought back home.  We told them that we have been looking all over for him.  Today you tell us that he is dead.  We have been here many times but you kept on telling us that you do not know him.  We do not believe that he is dead.  Now please we want to be sure.\n Now Mr Tulo explained that - he even left us his telephone numbers so that he can be contacted.  He said he was really scared to tell us that he had been sent by the office because the office would maybe harass him, or the \nHRV/799 family/...\n5\nfamily would request the office to carry the expenses. We now had R6 000 in our hand and we went to the offices. I remember the final date was the 18th of March 1994 and they said to us it is impossible to bring the corpse back home because the child was buried on the 11th.  In the previous requests we told them that we want our corpse so that we can bury it ourselves.  The second point that we requested from them was can we send two of the family members so that they can go to Dar es Salaam and witness the burial.  But still they said no it's impossible. \n That puzzled us as a family, we didn't know what to do, until on the final date when another gentleman came and they said he was from Dar es Salaam, his name was William Nkonyane.  They said they will ask him to come over to explain to us exactly what happened.  According to the Sotho tradition I do not believe that my son is dead because I never saw his body, and I don't believe it because every day they brought different statements.  They never told us one story right through.  Every time they would tell us different stories.\n I have a request to make to the Commission, can I please be helped with the remains of my child so that they can be buried in South Africa?  I still do not believe, even if I am making this request, I do not believe that we will be bringing back my child.   He didn't leave alone.  He left with his friend, I know him as Juwel and I had hoped that when they come back you know one of them would come to me and tell me what actually took place, but up to this day nothing.  I only got an album from Juwel.  I was expecting maybe to get his clothes so that I can believe or just his one photo taken where he was in Dar es Salaam so that I\nHRV/799 could/...\n6\ncould believe that it's true my son had been to Dar es Salaam.  The album that I got was ordinary photos that he took while he was here in South Africa and Juwel didn't bring those photos to me personally he sent them via another person because they didn't want to meet the family.",

Together with my mum we used to go to Juwel's mother, that's where our hope lay because we thought she would tell us any information with regard to the children, but she told us that she hadn't received anything.   And we have been asking the PAC people of the possibility, especially during those years in 1994 even if we were stupid HRV/799 enough/...\n7\nenough but we knew that the organisations had been unbanned and we requested her whether there was a possibility of him writing to us because his uncle had information and he helped a lot of people.  He was working at the Red Cross at that time. Not the South African Red Cross, it was the Red Cross in other countries. But the answer that we got from Juwel's mother was that no I haven't heard anything from my son.  I haven't received even a letter.  I remember last year but Juwel's grandmother's name has skipped my mind but as we were just conversing, you know just talking generally I was deeply hurt by this issue and she said she was Juwel's grandmother and Juwel's letter used to be posted to her house and I told her that I haven't received anything from my son since the last day I saw him that was in March 1991.
