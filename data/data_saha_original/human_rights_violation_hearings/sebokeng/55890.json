            "I can't remember the dates but in that month I was with Andrew who was my son-in-law.  We used to knock-off at the same time.  We were working in Johannesburg and then we used to travel together home and he said to me mum I'm going to a night vigil and I said to him brother, well that's fine, if you're going to the night vigil it's okay.  I asked him where is the night vigil, he said in Zone 7, a friend of ours has passed away and then we are now going to the night vigil.  I said to him okay that's fine with me, go.  And thereafter he said no, I think I'll wait for a few friends of mine to arrive.  Yes duly they all arrived.  Both girls and boys came because they were all comrades and they prepared food before they could leave and after eating you know they decided to walk to Zone 7 because I was staying in HRV/820 Everton/...\n2\nEverton, until the reached Zone 7 on foot because they were using shortcuts.  And as I was alone at home I decided to sleep.  As I was sleeping since the time he left it was about 7 o'clock, we slept with the children and his wife, at about 4 o'clock in the morning I heard a knock at my door and I asked who are you?  No Mother this is me the comrade you saw yesterday, and I was worried.  What is it now?  The comrade said please mum open the door it's me.  I woke up and I opened the door.  When I opened the door he got into the house and he said mom I am going to fetch you, things are bad in Zone 7.  I asked him what happened?  He said no I am here to fetch you, things are just not right.  Truly I took my blanket and I put on my clothes quickly and I went straight to my neighbour, to this woman next to me, and I said to her please woman accompany me to Zone 7, I have just received the news that things are not right.  She said to me wait a few minutes I want to take my blanket as well.  I said okay I remembered that his aunt was also on our way to Zone 7 and we decided to get a taxi to pick her up. Well the three of us left to Zone 7.  We used a passage that is leading to the place.  When we were about to enter the dining room door we saw Father Macamel and Father Macamel said please do not use the front door use the back door, just go and use the small gate because we are busy here with the people who have died here.  When we were at the gate here is my son Andrew lying on the floor, on the ground, red of blood.  We stood there puzzled not knowing what to do.  This woman next to me took her blanket off and then cover it over his body.  We went to Macamel and said, Father Macamel we found our son and he said who is his name?  We said it's Andrew and he was taken to the others that have already been HRV/820 placed/...\n3\nplaced on the ground.  We were now waiting for the corpses to leave for the mortuary.  We waited in the tent.  I now saw this other lady who was with them the previous night at 7 o'clock and I asked this lady what had happened actually?  And she said mum, we arrived here and we were told that there's not going to be any funeral at all, and another woman said please let us not talk now can we clean the blood and then we decided to clean the blood and then we were sweeping this blood.  While we were still sweeping the police arrived.  We were told to stop a few minutes so that the police can come in.  They were together with a White person wearing a khaki trouser.  We continued sweeping the blood and then we finished and then we sat down.  We were waiting for the mortuary, the funeral undertakers to come and get the corpses.  I will end there.",
