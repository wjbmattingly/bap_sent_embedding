            "My son was just an ordinary boy. He was just silly like any other teenager but there was nothing different about him.   It is just that in many ways I was a father I was not staying with him most of the time and I would like to believe that he was not a silly boy, he was just like any other kid.  I think it was in September, it was 1976 he had gone with his friends, they were from Sharpeville in Vereeniging.  They went to Johannesburg.  When they got to Johannesburg he went to see his other friends.  He even - of black power.  When he showed that HRV/817 sign/...\n2\nsign or he made that sign that is when the police shot him.  Shot him at the back. His friends ran away.   He was taken to the Baragwanath Hospital.  When he was taken to the Baragwanath he was assaulted and also kicked, especially his face was swollen.  When the other children went to see him a friend of my daughter's came to tell us about Lucas' injuries and he helped us trace him.  We went there but when they went there they were chased away, up to such time that he was referred to the General Hospital.  Even at General Hospital it was very difficult for us to see him.  My children kept on being chased away.  He was put in the ICU ward.  When he was at the ICU on another day when they went to see him they were told that Lucas was not there, he had run away.  He had skipped the country.  But they never wanted to tell us as to how he was when he left.  They just could not explain as to how he sustained his injuries and how he was when he left.  Now they took his two photos, these appeared in the worlds newspaper that he should be traced.  When this appeared in the newspapers the police chased my daughter.  There was a rumour that he had skipped the country and he was in exile.  Now all this was taken as if it was a rumour from his friends but the very same friends who were with him on that particular day had all gone out, had skipped the country.  There was also a rumour that he was able to skip the country together with them. That is when we had a hope that possibly when he went out he was able to skip the country and run away.  But even though it was like that I personally never knew anything as to how he skipped the country because I believed that all the organisations, especially the students uprising, most of the children used to come to me and we also wanted to know as to HRV/817 who/...\n3\nwho was coming and who was arriving at that particular time.  But I never heard anything about my son.  Nobody told me about my son.  Up till such time that when I got here I received the news that as I have already said, I had a hope that when other children were coming back, that is his friends, he was also going to be amongst them.  But he was never to be seen.  I tried by all means to take further steps in order to try and trace his whereabouts.  Many of them as well as friends of the family, there were rumours circulating that he had been seen on television amongst the people who were actually arriving.  Some had heard that other friends of his had come back.  It is true that some came back but we never actually met them.  I took further steps, I went to the United Nations Embassy to try and look at their roll, their list of names, maybe I could see his name amongst the names that were listed there.  I had a hope that I would see his name as he was an exile.  But I could not see his name.  I could not get any person that I could talk to about my son.  Up till today.  I decided to give up the search for my son because I kept on asking myself as to where he had gone to because others had come back but he didn't come back.  I kept on wondering as to where he was.  I thought maybe he was using a different name when he was outside the country.  And probably that is why I could not trace him.  As it was still like that trying to trace the whereabouts of my son and trying to get the names that they used when they were outside the country, probably if I could know this name I could be able to trace him.  Maybe that is how I lost.  I believe that during all that time even if he was left behind at the time he was supposed to have been here by now.  Even some of his friends have now already HRV/817 died/...\n4\ndied.  There is a lady that he was supposed to get married to but the lady has since been deceased.  But the police at the end told us that he had run away.  When they went to look for him he ran away and they couldn't get him anyway.  That is where his history ends.  Up till now that I have come to report nobody knows where he went to.  We last heard that he was at the hospital when he was shot by the police and we were told that he had skipped the country.  But I can't get him.  That is all I can say.",
