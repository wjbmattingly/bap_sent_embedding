            "On the 18th in the morning when I was at home, I heard on the news that there was a white Jetta which was driving around shooting people in Sebokeng. It was driven by a male and a female. A man and a female died. I woke up and went to the cemetery.  Just as I went into the cemetery I came across my uncle and I could see that my uncle's face was spelling tragedy. I told my uncle that I had heard in the news that some people had died and I asked him as to which families were affected.My uncle avoided looking me in the eye, he said to me it's Molebatsi. Then he told me that he had come to fetch me so that I could go with him to Zone 12 where Molebatsi was staying and we went together with my\nHRV/823 uncle/...\n2\nuncle on foot because there was no transport and we went to Zone 12.  When we got to Zone 12, that is now the house, I saw my aunt as well as another lady and our neighbours. As I was getting into the house they helped me and they led me into the bedroom. They had already put the mattress down.  I sat on the mattress and I kept on asking them as to what was happening. I asked them whether they were sure that Molebatsi had died. My aunt told me that they were sure because they had gone to where Molebatsi had died and when they got there he was not there any more because the Hippo had taken him.  But what we got there was that there was blood, there was a pool of blood, that's why they say they were sure that he had been killed. I said to them they mustn't start mourning because I hadn't yet believed that he had died.  I told them that I would go around trying to search for him until such time that I get him. \n Then on a Tuesday morning I went to Sebokeng police station, that is where I got Molebatsi. He had been shot just above the eye as well as on the chest.  I came back and when I got home they had already started mourning and they had smeared the windows. I told them that I did not understand how all this happened, I wished to talk to an eye witness. People kept on coming as well as Dolly's family and Dolly's neighbours. They also came with the same message, that there is a certain neighbour who came from Dolly's place and he knocked at Dolly's place, he spoke to Dolly's father and asked where Dolly was and asked him whether they were all at home. Dolly's father replied that there was only one missing. They both went outside and Dolly's father discovered the two corpses.  Dolly's father passed the message to my uncle's place and my uncle sent the message \nHRV/823 that/...\n3\nthat I should notified of what had happened. That is where I will end.",

As we were still watching the television my husband said he wanted to go and sleep early because he was going to work the following morning and I was left watching TV. As I was still watching TV my daughter was busy studying in the bedroom.  My eldest daughter had gone out.  The little children were left and they were sleeping in their respective bedrooms. I was remaining all by myself now in the dining room still watching the television.  Just as Hani was being brought\nHRV/823 into/...\n7\ninto the stadium, I heard a loud bang, I heard the guns twice, I heard it for the third time and at that time I ran and switched the TV off. I ran into my daughter's bedroom and I told her to switch off the lights because I could hear gun shots from outside.  I heard it a fourth time and could hear that it was getting closer and closer to the house but there was nothing that I could do.  I switched off the lights and the house was dark.  We ran into the bedroom and we decided to sleep. I did not close my gate because I was awaiting my daughter who had gone out.  Even the kitchen was not locked because I was waiting for my daughter to come back.  We got into the blanket, still in that state of confusion.  We stayed for quite some time in the blanket until such time that I was feeling sleepy.\n In the middle of the night as we were sleeping I heard somebody knocking at the door and when this person was knocking I woke my husband up and told him to go and check who was at the door. When he got to the door he saw Mr  Machobani.  Mr Machobani said, \"I just want to get into the house\".  This was related to me by my husband. They went outside with Mr Machobani together.  Mr Machobani pointed out that he didn't want to talk to my husband in the house because there was some tragedy outside.  He did not want to scare the children.  They went out together with Mr Machobani.  When they got outside they saw Dolly and Molebatsi who were made to lie down on their stomachs and they were being shot whilst they were lying down and the place was full of blood.  It was a pool of blood surrounding them. Mr Machobani made attempts to wake the neighbourhood, to make them aware that tragedy has struck.  That was my husband and Mr Machobani.  They went to tell the police that HRV/823 people/...\n8\npeople had been shot.  The police came and I just saw a very bright light at the time. I saw it through the window and my neighbour was already there.  Then they told the children not to make any noise, they should keep quiet but in such a situation you cannot tell people to keep quiet.  We sat with the other women, there came a big pick-up. The pick-up had a very big and bright light.  Until such time that they had finished taking the corpses then they went away with the corpses. Towards dawn the corpses were already collected.\nThey told me that at LTA there was something bad happening.",

She was also doing parttime over the weekends.  She was working at certain shops in order to maintain her child.

We have listened carefully to what you have said and the loss that you suffered on that night with your daughter dying and probably a son in law because you said you knew that they were in a relationship. But not only that, it sounds from what you were saying that Dolly was your husband's favourite and we know, we hear all the time where parents, a parent or a loved one passes away soon after something like this has happened, as I'm sure your HRV/823 husband/...\n12\nhusband must have been.  We've also heard your request for help with Dolly's child and you will hear from the Commission once the policy is developed and once we've made a finding. Thank you very much for coming.",
