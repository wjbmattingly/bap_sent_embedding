            "These things began around 1990.  I have heard things being said about Ketisi, Ketisi is coming from a meeting, I don't know whether he was with Temba and somebody else and the other civic.  They were staying, they were living so well because they had cars.  When we arrived here in 1979 my son was younger and Ketisi was older than him and HRV/1052 they/...\n2\nthey used to call him to wash out the cars, clean up the cars.  It went on and on.  I heard that he was attending meetings and so forth and I heard from that meeting it was said Ketisi shall be shot.  No one came to tell me about this, I just heard rumours, the hearsays from the buses and from other people.  And as time went on, one day when I was coming from work I heard that Ketisi has been shot.  He was shot there at the civic.  I cannot even point at those civics because I don't know much about them.  I saw the police cars outside at night and I looked through the window and I just heard that Ketisi had just been shot.  The following day is when I went for work and I hadn't met his mother then.  When I got back from work I found out that Ketisi had been shot right there at the civic.  I don't really want to lie, I don't know what was the problem really.   Because they used to say Ketisi is driving cars and he's not working.  And I also heard that when Ketisi gets killed his friends also has to be killed.  I never thought really, to tell the truth, that I will also be affected by this.  Afterwards I heard that my child also has to be killed because I am the neighbour of the Ketisi's.  One day I heard that people had been shot and I heard also that - I was surprised because what I knew is that Ketisi was at the hospital.  The case went on and on.  I really don't know how far the evidence went.  When they arrested they also came to kidnap my children and they were taken to the civic of the Zone 12 to tell the truth because if they don't they will burn my children, all of them, because we were their neighbours and were eventually affected by that.  I said I don't know anything, I really don't know anything but God knows everything.  They said I am a liar, I know so \nHRV/1052 much/...\n3\nmuch, yet I didn't know anything.  I opened the house and I said come in and check, check, search in the house and see if you will find anything because I know I'm innocent in this whole matter.  They said they were going to burn me.  I said I don't care even if they kill me but God knows better.  After a week and after two weeks they brought us home.  When we got home people were so scared of us as if we were animals, as if we kill, as if we are killers that's how they were scared of us, avoiding us.  I never went to Madala.  Really I know I am innocent in this thing.  God knows better.  If they so wish they can kill me but I know that I am innocent.",

            "When we got back things had changed. We were there and they will sing about me saying I am a pretender along with, together with Ketisi's mother.  We know much better than this.  And I really don't know why they were accusing me of things I did not know.  And I decided to leave.  In 1992 they shot my son at the shops.  Sipo came to tell me that Thesilo has been shot by other comrades.  After that one other came, also one of the comrades, he warned me to leave the house because they've already shot Silo and I must run away, I must leave the house because they were coming now to burn the house.  And he also further went on to say run away, you must leave, because they were saying, they were waiting for the schools to open and as soon as the schools have opened they will come and burn the house.  We left truly the house hoping that after some time when things have calmed down we will get back.  And I left the house.\nHRV/1052 We/...\n4\nWe left for Zone 10.  It was a week already, they hadn't burned my house. And they left, after that I just heard that they had burnt one other house.  And when the second week came that's when these things started, they burned my house.  My house was destroyed completely by fire.  To show that I was innocent I got back home and I occupied the house again and I made use of the things that were not affected by fire and I used them.  I tried to take those things which were not destroyed and they told me that things have changed in the location and I went to the police station and when I got to the police station I was told that I should go back home.  I was then told that there were now trenches in the streets. They have organised the transport to sell my belongings.  The police knew exactly the people who were burning our houses.  I wanted the people to appear before us.  We have never seen people who killed other people, we haven't seen these people who have been burning our houses.  So many things have happened.  We were assaulted.  I even left the church because I was referred to as an Inkatha member.  \n I remember in 1985 with the Sharpeville Six issue I was a woman belonging to a church organisation.  We were kneeling with our knees, praying for those kids, because we've already heard that they were going to be hanged and God listened to our prayers because at a later stage we heard that they have been paroled.  Because I was a woman belonging to a church organisation I knelt and I prayed.  I wanted to meet the Bishop because he was a member, or a priest of our church.",

I said no it's true my house was burnt.  They said go first to the police station because we don't want people coming to get food free of charge.  They said I should go to Vanderbijl Park.

We as parents we do suffer as a consequence of what our children do.  When you sleep at home you don't know what your child is doing out there at night.  We try by all means to raise these children in a good way not knowing what's happening out there when they get to the streets.  We end up suffering as parents just as you are suffering today as a parent.  And even people of Vaal did experience some\nHRV/1052 pain/...\n9\npain about the people who've been killed in this place also they do show that they don't trust, even the policemen who were actually supposed to investigate all those things, so that all the people, the perpetrators shall come forward and be disciplined.  They have expressed some disillusionment also in the lack of enthusiasm that was expressed by our police in finding out and solving the problems in this area.  So it's clear that the pain was both sides.  You see when many people are seeing that the police are not doing their job they take the law into their own hands and want to do justice.  The pain is there now.  I do feel bad that you even left the church when you see that the church was helpless, could not help you in any way.  Also I feel bad that today Bishop Tutu is absent as he was your Archbishop in your church you would have spent some time with him if he was here.  We will kindly ask you to go back to church so you can regain that strength back and prayer will help.  The truth still has to come out and as I see, by the look of things the police should come forward, the very police you are talking about should come forward and reveal the truth.  And also your son Hunter is in prison, he is awaiting for an opportunity to say all what he can say.  We do trust and hope that when that case begins again the truth will come.\n We have heard all your requests.  As I have said already we will forward all those requests to where they should be.
