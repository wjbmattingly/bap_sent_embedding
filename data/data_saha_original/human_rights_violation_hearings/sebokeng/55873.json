            "On the 17th of June 1992 people attacked at my place.  We were sleeping at night, we just heard some noise outside.  When we tried to open we heard those people talking in Zulu.  The very attackers saying, \"Wake up you dogs\" and with the listening I heard the door, the door burst open as if they were throwing some stones on it.  After that my mum and my dad were already awake then, everyone in the house was awake. As we were still listening I saw a tall man storming in the house, one of them said, \"Here's a bitch, kill it!\" They threw in a burning tyre inside the house, it looked like a group of young people who were just, who were the very ones who put, set it into fire.\n I asked, \"What have we done?\".  They said, \"Keep quiet bitch, are you still busy asking, why are you asking?\" I found that they've already blocked some way for us in the passage, there was no way out for us but I managed to get a chance for escaping. I ran, I escaped as fast as my feet could carry me. Our house was surrounded by those attackers. Some tried to catch me.  Fortunately I managed to escape. \n I left my place to our neighbours, that is the fourth house from my house just in the front.  I found out that three men were running after me, I got to this house, I knocked at the door, they opened for me.  When they opened \nHRV/122 the/...\n2\nthe door they already heard my voice, fortunately. I could not hold myself. I told them that I'm suspecting those people could have caused a lot of damage back home.\n After a few minutes, plus or minus 30 minutes, I went back home, there was no one at home but that burning tyre was still burning inside the house. What happened, I went outside to ask the neighbours were my sisters and brothers? Only to find that they were under the beds.  \n When those people left, the attackers, I mean, I went to ask the neighbours if they saw my brothers and sisters. Fortunately they were just around there.  When I asked where was my mum and my father, they said they didn't see them, they didn't know where they were. One of the neighbours approached me ...(sobbing)",
