I was detained and when I was - when I came out of prison, I came out of prison in 1986 and I was arrested again and before I went out of prison, they took my clothes outside the house and people took everything I had.  When I came out of prison I stayed with other people, because my furniture was taken out of my house.  \nMy son Sizakele Mbekushe told me that they had a youth meeting on that day.  He went out to the meeting on that day.  At about five to six p.m. we heard people singing -  toi-toiing and we heard gun shots while people were toi-toiing.  After a while my sister's child came in and said that my sister is calling me.  When I arrived there I saw my son lying down.  I called him Sizakele - he could not say anything out of his mouth.\nI asked other children who were around to go out - and to go out and find a car.  When we arrived at the doctor in front of the OK, the doctor told us he was already dead and we have to take him to the hospital.  We took him to the hospital and we came back.

People who killed my son they were not arrested.  Instead of arresting them, police arrested those who were toi-toiing.\nI was not sure exactly who shot my son.  Between Ketile - between Ketile and Thabo - I was not sure exactly who shot my son, but only the comrades who were together with my son were arrested.  \nAfter the funeral, it was in December, in January I received a letter saying that I should appear in court in the charge office.  We stayed there for a long time and after the court [indistinct]  called me.
