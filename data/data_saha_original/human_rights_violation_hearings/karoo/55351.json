My brother's child went into my house, Fundiswa, and she told Funeka that we must go.  And Funeka was already up  at that stage.  They left together.  \nAfter a while when they were gone, I just heard a few shots.  After a time they've gone, I just heard a few shots.  After the shots, there were children who ran past.  They were running.  Thereafter I lay down until in the morning.  And then my sister Sionzana arrived and she said your child is in Bloemfontein in the government mortuary.  And then I was shocked and that's the last thing I heard. Thank you.  It seems I have finished giving my testimony.",
