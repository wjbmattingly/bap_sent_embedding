<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>Please will you tell us what happened on that day in September 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MR ZONO</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>Nomalanga came to call my brother together with his friends, they were sitting in my sisters house and they went to Nomalanga's home because Nomalanga told them that Booi was there.  And Booi came out of the house and he fired shots and he shot my brother.  And he shot the other one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a> Yes he was a policeman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>[indistinct] the people who went to the house, go speak to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MR ZONO</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>Nomalanga called them so that they can chase away Booi because the policeman were not allowed in the location.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>I see thank you - please go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR ZONO</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>He shot my brother and he covered him with a zinc and he went to the police station - he came back with a van and he took my brother with the van to the mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a> And I was working for the Municipality at that time and they told me there that my brother is dead and he told me that I was needed at home - I was called at home.  And when I arrived at home there were many people at home and they told me that my brother was shot - he has passed away.  They told me  my brother has passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>Thank you Mr Zono - do you know if other people were injured at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR ZONO</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>Yes there was one but he is not here in the hall - his surname is Kebane he is in Johannesburg now.  The bullet was taken out in Bloemfontein from his body.  And the police took him to see my brother who has passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>Now there was an inquest into your brother's death and our investigators were able to get the inquest record - do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>MR ZONO</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>No I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>[indistinct] that we can inform you that an inquest was held and Constable Booi Jack did make a statement and explained that he was hiding from a group of young people and then he decided to fire at them and that is how your brother was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> But the inquest found that nobody was responsible - that's what they said at the inquest.  And so nobody was ever charged or found responsible for your brother's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a> Is - do you know where constable Booi Jack is now?</p>
