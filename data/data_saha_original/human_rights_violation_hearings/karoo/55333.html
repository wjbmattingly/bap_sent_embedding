<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>This brings us then to the end of our public hearing in Colesberg.  We have taken a number of statements in the are and these that we have heard today are an illustration of the many things that were experienced in Colesberg, particularly in the 1980's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>We have heard of division in the community at that time and we have also heard that some of those difficulties and divisions persist today and that is part of the legacy of our past.  Mr Maciki said to us there was no peace in those years and people were not willing to endure anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>We have heard terrible stories.  We have heard of excesses that were carried out by members of the police and they municipal police.  Where have heard of the excesses that were carried out also by the members of the community organisations.  And many allegations have been made today and people have been named.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>We hope that people will come forward of their own will to tell us of things they were involved in to seek amnesty if necessary and to make peace with one anther.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>The one thing that is an obstacle in the way of development is ongoing conflict and violence in communities.  We have made an effort to understand some of the truth of what was happening in this area at this time and part of our reason for coming here today has been to shed a light into Colesberg and as we said into it's ongoing problems as well as into it's past.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>We urge leaders and members of the community to take responsibility, to take action to extend a hand of friendship, to cross the barriers that divide and to walk forwards.   Much of the suffering that we have heard about, in fact led to the major political changes that have brought us to where we are today.  In 1994 to a democratic election and a new government and then to the establishment of this Commission and people in many parts of the world has referred to this as a miracle.  And have seen it as a sign of hope.  And so it was.  But that miracle still needs a lot more work to make it transform the everyday lives of people.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>We know that there is more work to be done.   We hope that this is one step in that process work and we call on you all to take hands together to bring that miracle to fulfilment.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>I want to thank the many people who have helped us to hold this hearing today.  In the first place the municipality here for supplying the venues today and in the preparatory work.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>We would like to thank the town clerk and his staff. </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> We thank Manalise and other people in the Karoo clinic for assisting with the logistic arrangements.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>We thank those members of the ANC constituency who assisted us with statement taking.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>We thank the Forster family for supplying and decorating the plants to add beauty to the stage today. </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>We thank Sollie Terblanche and his team for supplying the sound which has enabled you to hear the proceedings and we thank you to hear the team of interpreters who have allowed you to hear it in your own language.  They carry out very demanding work, very tiring and very important and we thank them very much for all of their efforts. </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>We thank the members of the press for their support and their interest in this process.  It is very important that they carryout their or exposing  what we have heard today around the country.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>We thank the people who have assisted us with catering.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>We thank the Reverent Thani  of the South African Council of churches for his support. </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>We thank Captain Saunders and his team from the South African Police services for the policing and protection of the buildings that we have used and for the members of the Commission as we have moved about the area.  We know it isn't easy for them to hear the anger and strong feelings that are still expressed about members of the police and we know that a part of the building of the future has to be to build the kind of police force which is trusted and respected by all the members of the community. </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>I'd like to thank the members of our own team.  To thank our logistics officer, Gail van Breda, all of her team.  All the work they have had to do, we have given them additional work, by travelling from town to town in this area and they have coped with it magnificently and fulfilled our vision of reaching a greater number of people and enable you all to fulfil this hall without having to travel to a far away town to do so.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>I thank my fellow commissioners, Ms Seroke, who has once again come from Gauteng to join us as a member of our panel, we appreciate it very much.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>And Advocate Potgieter who like me, comes from the Cape Town office, we thank him once again.   He comes straight here from being involved in the hearing in Upington so he has had a very heavy load to carry in recent weeks.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>And most of all we thank you the members of the community for your support and your interest and we wish you well in the time ahead.  Thank you very much.   We ask you please just to remain quietly in the hall to allow the witnesses to leave before us.</p>
