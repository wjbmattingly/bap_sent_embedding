            "It was on the 3 July.  It was in the morning.  We were toi-toiing.  We were toi-toiing from the Apostolic church.  While we were still toi-toiing, there is another church, the Methodist church.  We left we were a group of people and we left the toi-toi at that time. \nI was on my way home at that time and I met my friends on my way home.  We stayed on the way with my friends, but not in the main road where people were toi-toiing in the other street.  While we were still in that street, police came with a Casspir  and they came to watch us.  They had binoculars with them.  They came to the place where we were staying.  As we see the Casspir was approaching us, we decided to go to one of the nearest houses, Ms Lutolo's house.  \nThe police stopped the Casspir near this house.  The other police went in the back door and the others came through the front door.  They found me inside the house.  They didn't say anything.  They didn't ask anything from us.  The first policeman names Jansen touched my shoulder and he dragged out of the house in the front door and he kicked me and there was  a policeman waiting for me outside the house.  They beat me with their guns, their rifles, they kicked me and they took me to Casspir.  They put me inside the Casspir.  The Casspir has got two seats inside and their is a passage in the middle.  I was told to lie down flat on that passage between the seats.  They kicked me severally at that time.  They stamped me, they  stamped on me.  \nAnd all this time they were kicking me, they placed me on top of the Casspir with a sjambok around my neck and around my waist.  They were beating me all this time.  They told me to toi-toi, because I was toi-toiing.  They told me to say Viva and I did all that.  They were assaulting me all this time with their sjamboks.  All this time this police were beating me and they moved they drove the Casspir to town and I saw two police vans, a brown and a yellow one.  They transferred me from the Casspir to the van.  \nWhile I was in the van I think they arrested me at about eleven to twelve p.m.  Before one o'clock the police came back and Chris was one of the police who was there.  He was a detective here in Colesberg, initially he is from Aliwal North.  He accused me of burning his car.  He came to me with one litre Coca Cola.  He opened and entered inside the van.  That litre of Coca Cola was empty.  He knocked me with that empty bottle on my left eye severely. The one white policeman came and he dragged him out of the van trying to stop him from beating me.  The Hippo was following the van and they took me to the police station with the van.  [Indistinct]    \nI was taken out of the van and they were beating me and assaulting me all the time.  I was taken to the charge office.  Chris came from the Casspir and he took me to the back. Through the back door of the police station.  He took me to shower in the police station.  What they did to me in the charge office, Chris opened the shower, the tap of the shower, together with Jansen.  Chris had a cane and Jansen had a sjambok in their hands.  Chris put me under the shower and accused me of burning his car.  He was asking me why I burned down his car.  I couldn't answer him at that time.  I was crying all the time.  They didn't stop.  \nWhen they finished with beating me, the took me to another room.  In that room there many policemen waiting for me there.  The first policeman showed me tied my hands and there was one policeman with an axe handle.  All of those policemen who were in that room, they assaulted me several times with this axe handle.  They gave each other a chance to beat me.  They didn't stop.  They put a sack in my face. And they twisted my private parts.  I couldn't see at that time because the sack was in my face.  They at this time my face was still covered with the sack.  They didn't stop there.  There is a drawer in that room and they took my private parts and put them inside the shelves and close it hard.  And they then took me outside and then they took me inside again to do the same thing to me again.  That was not all they did to me.  \nThey took me to another room, the third room.  When I got in that third room, they were boers in that room, the white men.  They assaulted me. They were beating me up.  They were doing all this dirty work to me.  I was taken out of that room, it was late.  At about midnight they took me to the garage.  When I got in the garage there was a van in that police garage.  They took me to the van.  \nIn all this time, I was naked all this time.  They took off my clothes.  They took me to van and they told me to lie there.  When I look inside this van, there was blood all over the van.  I couldn't sleep in that van, because I was so scared.  I saw blood all over the van.  I stayed there for ten minutes and they took me out of the van.  I think it was about six to eight boers who came to take me out.  There were also black policemen who were there.  They had R1 rifles with them.  They took me out of the van to the gate.  They told me to run.  I refused to run away.  I refused to run away.  \nThey took me inside again.  They were beating me and assaulting me all this time and I was naked.  They took me to the front door of the police station.  It was during the time at that time at about two.  My attorney phoned them and told them they must release me and that was when I was released and I went back home.  Thank you.",

The following morning I went to the police station to ask the police not to beat Patrick, because Patrick is not well.  It was locked at the police station.   No-one opened the door for me.  I was asked to knock at the back door.  I knocked until the opened.  There was a white policeman there.  I asked where Patrick was.  They said they have never heard  of him.  I said you took Patrick in a Casspir.  I banged on the counter.  I said my child is here with the police.  \nPatrick then leapt from amongst the police.  They had hidden him in the most atrocious way.  Patrick then fell. I asked why are you hiding Patrick.  What has he done.  Why are you treating him like this.  Why would he leap only when I banged the counter.  This man then said he does not know what Patrick has done.  I should go and ask the police in the Casspir.  I went back to the township.  I accosted the Casspir.  I asked the police in the Casspir what police has done.  What Patrick had done.  I said Patrick is not well, he is not healthy.  Please give him back to me.  They refused.  They said is they would find Patrick in the streets, they would shoot him.",
