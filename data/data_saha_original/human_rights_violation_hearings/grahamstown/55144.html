<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MPHIWISI DAVID "SIGCAWU" NAZO:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, he has been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We welcome you, Mr Nazo.  We will hand over to Tiny Maya to lead you with questions on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Nazo, in your statement here you are going to tell us about yourself, about two incidents from 1976 up until 1986 or 1976 and 1983.  Please explain to us what was happening at that time.  Were you a member of any organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> Yes, I was a member of COSAS.  I was doing standard six at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What year was this?  Is it 1976?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> Yes, it was 1976.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened in 1976?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> In 1976 we were protesting against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of expression in schools.  We wanted English to be used.  We took steps as students.  We burnt down Afrikaans books.  After the police were called to our school.  They then took us to the police station.  They beat us, they assaulted us.  They would put a sack, a wet sack in our faces and tie this sack.  All this time they would beat us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> For how long did you stay in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> I stayed for a week.  We were then released after that week.  After three weeks a school was burnt.  We were then detained again, because the police wanted us to tell them who burnt down the school.  At that time there was one white police, Kraus and Jibilikile Khani, they would take us to the garage and beat us with the fishing rods.  All the time we were doing push-ups and they would beat us with these fishing rods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where was this garage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> It was in the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said that you were doing standard six, how old were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> I was about 15 or 16 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What was the name of the school you attended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> It was Cannon Higher Primary School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> When you were taken back to the cells, for how long did you stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> I stayed for a month, but one Sunday when the Boers were beating us certain people cried.  We were then released on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you appear before the Magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> No, I appeared before the Magistrate when I was arrested for public violence when I was coming from St Albans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What year was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> It was in 1983.  I was arrested all the time.  My home was a prison.  I did not have time to stay at home and to enjoy life with my family.  As I result of this I am  confused, I do not remember, clearly, the dates.  I would be released this morning at 11, they will come again and arrest me at three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> From 1976?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> Yes, from 1976. I was then arrested under the State of Emergency.  They took me to Kennispos where I was assaulted the whole day.  They would give me porridge all the time.  They then transferred me to Peterson in an old cell that has weeds in it.  They then transferred me to St Albans.  We were tortured there.  There, Mr Sandi was there, we were together in that prison.  In St Albans it was a very terrible situation.  They then transferred me to Kirkwood.  Then it was better in Kirkwood.  When I was supposed to be released they said I was charged with public violence.  They took me to Kenton.  That was the 13th month I was in prison all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a> I appeared in court, I was released with a R500,00 bail.  They gave me a date to appear in court.  I then hired a lawyer, Mr Sandi.  The case continued for three days.  The advocate there was Mr Fourie from Grahamstown.  On the third day the Magistrate argued with the advocate and after that the Magistrate asked them why they were arresting me.  After that the case was withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> As you were arrested as a student, you were doing standard six, you will be arrested in the morning and in  the evening.  Did you manage to continue with your education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> I went to Ciskei to continue with my education.  When I completed my standard eight my father passed away.  I tried to do standard nine.  After passing standard nine my mother passed away, my brothers were looking after me.  I tried to do standard ten.  One white man helped me.  I managed to get my standard ten certificate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you remember the name of this white man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> It was Mr Terry Marais from Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Is he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NAZO:</span> Yes, he is.</p>
