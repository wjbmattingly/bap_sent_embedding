<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>REVD XUNDU: Mr Chairman, I would like to swear the witnesses in, starting with you Nomtandazo Lydia Kaleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">NOMTANDAZO LYDIA KALENI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">TEMBILE ALFRED SWARTBOOI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MANDLA BROWN KASO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Chairperson, they have been sworn in.  Ma'am, I would like to start with you.  Please tell us very briefly in your own words what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> I had gone to work on that day and I used to come back late because we knock off duty at six o'clock.  And only my two grandchildren used to be at home, no adult.  When I got home, my children came to me and said Ma, Veza has been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a> They used to call him Veza, they said to me Veza had been shot and there and then I was so upset, I wanted to know who shot at my children.  They said a casper, he had been shot from a casper.  I wanted to know where is he now and they said we do not know if he is at the hospital where our aunt works.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> I worked at the Town Hospital and she worked at the Provincial Hospital.  I walked around in a daze, hoping that a neighbour at least would come and tell me what had happened - nobody came and I did not know where to go, where</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>to start, who to go to first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> After my daughter had come off duty, before I gave her a chance I asked her if Velile was at hospital and she said what happened to Velile?  And I asked her is he not at your hospital because he has been shot and she wanted to know who told you - I said well, these children told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> She did not know anything about him having been shot.  Not even one of the people in the street or the location ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Just one moment please Ma'am.  I am trying to reach a point of clarity.  I hear what you are saying about the behaviour of the police which resulted in this, which hospital was he taken to?  Which hospital was he taken to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> He was taken to Alice by the people who took him.  From Alice because he was in a critical condition, he was taken to Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mtansani and he passed away at Cecilia Makiwane on the 31st.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did the police ever come to you to tell you about something like this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> No, not one policeman came to me and I never went to report anything to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Where was this child shot, was he playing in the street or was he at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> They had come from a prayer service at the Apostolic Church, or at one of the churches in the location.  It was on a public holiday and they were on their way home, when a casper passed them, they were close to home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was there a struggle in which they were involved at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> It was the struggle of the youth that all the youth were involved in at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Objecting to their gutter education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> With regards to his funeral, were there any conditions laid down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> On the day of the vigil, I was phoned and asked when I was going to bury the child.  The Investigator phoned me and wanted to know when I was going to bury the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you know who the Investigator was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> I have forgotten his name.  He left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> When did you bury him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> We buried him on the Tuesday according to what they wanted us to do.  I wanted to bury him the Saturday and they refused for us to bury him the Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were there any certificates which you obtained with regards to the cause of his death?  What did his death certificate state his cause of death to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> His death certificate stated that he had been shot in his head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you ever consult an Attorney in regard to charging anyone or anyone investigating the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> No.  After the child passed away, I went to the hospital in Alice and I was never referred to where the child passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And now that you are here before the Commission, what is your wish or request from this Commission?  What would you like this Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MS KALENI:</span> I have since left the matter in God's hands.  God will answer my prayers, and I maintain the same today.  I say that God will comfort me in regard to my child.  I have nothing more to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Madam.  We know that you are still heartbroken about this, but it seems as though you have told your story completely.  We are now going to go on to Tembile Alfred Swartbooi.  Mr Swartbooi, you are here to tell us about yourself, you were severely ill-treated.  It is clear that in Fort Beaufort and in other places, the police were lawless, they are doing anything, everything to people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a> We notice that this is the same in your story, but I would like you to tell us in your own words what happened to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> I was coming from work, I was working in the Municipality.  It was around half past five, I was going home.  They called me while I was in the yard.  It was late at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a> They assaulted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who were calling  you?  Who called you from the yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> The police called me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> They just beat you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, they beat me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> This man is telling us a story, his painful story.  He is not in a cinema, please behave yourselves.  It is not a laughing matter, you are making him a victim although he was a victim before.  They kicked you and you were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, I was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> You then went to the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> In which  hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> I went to Adelaide Hospital, they then transferred me to East London.  Even today I am getting</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>treatment from East London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> You got injured that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, I got injured that day - before I was well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was there a case opened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> No, there was no case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you get any compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> No, I did not get any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you get a pension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> I do get a pension, a grant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> By coming here to the Commission sir, what would you like the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> ; I would like the Commission to assist me because I am like an old man today, I am still very young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you have a wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> No, I don't have a wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Do you have children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> I have two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> In which standards are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> They are doing standard 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> You would also like the Commission to assist you to support your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, I would like the Commission to do that for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you sir.  Thank you.   Let us now come to you Mandla.  Mandla, you were also a victim of police violence and maybe anyone listening to this history of police violence, will realise that never again should the police abuse their position of power of authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a> Could you please just tell us very briefly about your assault by the police and if you were a member of an organisation, tell us which organisation you were a member of and what your role was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> I was at home and I heard shots in the street behind us.  I was struck by a bullet in my eye.  I was then taken by car to Alice.  At Alice I was told that this required specialist treatment and I was taken to East London and for a whole week this object was in my eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you ever lay a charge against the police who shot you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> This object was removed after a week, Friday, after a week and then these Doctors asked me if I could see, I said no.  My eye was removed and I had an artificial eye inserted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did anyone take a statement from you or did anyone - did you go to Attorneys to consult?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> I went to the police and Nkenke at the Investigative Unit in Fort Beaufort said to me that they would get back to me.  They took my statement, Nkenke took my statement and Nkenke and Makalima took my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a> Makalima is the one that wrote down my statement.  Nkenke and them would keep fetching me from my house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> And thereafter it just went quiet, you never heard from them again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> No, I never heard from them again and I never received any kind of compensation.  I received a letter saying that I should go to the Magistrate's court and from the Magistrate's court I was to go to the Doctor to try and get a pension.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a> I then took this paper to the Doctor, the Doctor</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who was this Doctor?  Perhaps our investigators could trace him?  Perhaps you could give the name to our investigators later.  Did you ever receive a grant since then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> No, I never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Have you got a wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Have you got children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How many children do you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How many wives?  There are three children, how many wives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> One wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How do you support your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> I do odd jobs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Does your wife work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How would you like the Commission to be of assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> I would like the Commission to assist me in whatever way it can because I am basically useless now.  I do not receive any pension.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What standards are your children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> One is in standard 3, the one is standard 2 and the one is in sub B, the little one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> So we will investigate the matter and see if we can make any recommendation to the President of the country.  Thank you very much.  Chairperson, I hand them back to you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KASO:</span> She is my sister.</p>
