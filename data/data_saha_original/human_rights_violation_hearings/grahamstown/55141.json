When I arrived there in the shop, one person came out of the shop.  He came to me, he said that, Comrade, I just want to know one thing, let us go outside.  We went out.  I did not ask what was it, I just went out with him.  I told him to hurry up, because I wanted to buy something in the shop.  When he arrived outside he said that you are one of the people who destroyed my food.  It was dark at the shop, when I went out I saw him taking out a knife.  I tried to\ndefend myself, I thought it was abating, because it was dark.  He cut, he chopped me and he ran away.  After that I went back, I ran back to the shop.  When I looked at my hand, my fingers were chopped.  The owner of the shop tried to help me, he tried to block the blood.  He phoned the ambulance, he phoned again the ambulance for the second time.  \n When the ambulance arrived they told me, they told him that they cannot take me to hospital.  They told the owner of the shop to phone the police.  The owner of the shop told them that he will pay them R10,00 to take me to hospital.  He paid them this R10,00 and they took me to hospital.  When I arrived in hospital the police also arrived.  They wanted to talk to me.  I told them that I cannot talk to them, because I was in pain.  I told them to come the following day.  They left.  The following morning they came back in hospital.  They asked me whether I was laying a charge against the person who did this to me.  I said, yes, but I will lay a charge when I would be, when I was out of hospital.  They asked me to give them a statement.  I said that I do not have a statement to give them.  I will go to them and give a statement when I was released from hospital.  The doctors took me to the theatre to operate me.  I stayed for two weeks and the third week, when I was going to the township, I met police in their Hippo.  People were running away.  I was still in pain at that time.  When I tried to run away the police came.  They took me to the Hippo.  When I was in that Hippo they kicked me although I was coming from the hospital.  They arrested me.  I was in pain and I told them that I was sick, I was not well.",
