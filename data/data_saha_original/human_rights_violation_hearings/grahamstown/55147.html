<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Over to you Mr Sandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Peter, you are here today to tell us the story about yourself.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You are from Alexandria.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> Yes, that is correct, I am from Alexandria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said that what happened to you in 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> In 1986 while I was at home, I was sleeping in  my bed, but I was not under the blankets, I was just reading  a book, lying in the bed.  The police then came.  They were together with the Municipality Police.  They knocked at the door.  They did not knock in a proper way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was it at night or was it during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> It was before eight o' clock at night, they kicked the door.  At home when it was raining our door would not close properly.  They just pushed the door and it opened.  My sister was there.  They asked her for my brother.  She said that she did not know where my brother was.  They then asked where I was.  She answered by saying that she did not know where I was, because she just arrived  at home.  They wanted to search the house.  At that time while I was reading the book I fell asleep, but I could hear that there were people talking.  When I woke up it was the time when they were coming in my room.  The light was still on as I was reading the book.  They came to me and they asked where are others.  I said who are you talking about.  They then looked under the bed and they opened the wardrobe.  ADV SANDI:  According to your knowledge, were there reasons for them, for searching for you, for looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you taking part in activities which will make the police to look for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When there was toy-toy in your area, in Alexandria, what would you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> I would join the toy-toy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were you toy-toying like the rest of the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was there any youth organisation or a resident's organisation in which you were a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> There was a youth organisation, but at that time I was not a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You said that they grabbed you by the chest.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> They took me out of the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they beat you all this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> Yes, the two police which were here today, they were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they beat you when they grabbed you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> They beat me with a sjambok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why were they beating you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> They did not tell me why they were beating me, they just beat me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> They took you to the police station?</p>

<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> As I was in the police station I was bleeding, because they beat me in my one eye.  They took me with their police van to the charge office.  When we arrived there they let me sit down, they gave me a cloth so that I can stop the blood, they phoned the ambulance.  They phoned the ambulance, the doctor said that he will send me straight to hospital.  He said that he cannot do anything about the injury in my eye.</p>

<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you get treatment there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who was your doctor in Port Elizabeth?  Do you remember?</p>

<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But you stayed for how long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> I stayed for two weeks.  I was discharged in the third week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you go to any attorney for advice about what happened to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> The attorney visited me in the hospital, an indian attorney, Naidoo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did he say that he was from Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> He just took a statement from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you see him, did you see Mr Naidoo after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> No, I did not see him after that, but he gave my case to another attorney, Vanessa, in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What did Vanessa do about this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PETER:</span> I use to go to visit her in Port Elizabeth.  She will tell me to come back again and I would do that.  It was very difficult for me to go from Alexandria to Port Elizabeth, because I could not afford it financially.  She then told me that she was going to telephone, to phone me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you were released from the hospital were you arrested?</p>

Mr Peter, the story of the people in this country, those who were fighting for liberation will not end with names, such as your name, are being mentioned when this story is revealed to other generations.  The police will be implicated when this story is being told to the other generation.  The people such as the other professionals, such as doctors, refused to treat people.  You also mentioned such a doctor who refused to treat you because of the apartheid system.  These names will come and they will be revealed to people.  Sir, together with other Comrades, we do remember your struggle, your participation in the struggle.  We thank you very much.</p>
