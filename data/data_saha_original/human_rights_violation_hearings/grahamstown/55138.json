Gadja's soldiers were detaining people and late that night an unknown man came, knocked at the door and said that he was sent by him that I should get three men to go and pick him up.  When he got there he found my husband, the name next door and his son and they went and picked him up where he had fallen and they said that he had been shot dead by Gadja Buthulezi's gang.  When he got home he was reeking of teargas, it was unbearable and he was saying that he, something was burning him in his stomach.  He would want water and, but he would not drink it.\n The following morning I took him to the surgery, to Dr Mbega, who was a doctor at Baragwaneth Hospital.  Dr Mbega said that he was reeking of teargas and it seems as if he had even taken, eaten something and the doctor examined him and we took him the following, the Saturday morning, the following day, called an ambulance to fetch him and took him to Baragwaneth.  He was admitted to Baragwaneth for three days and he was brought back and I kept taking him and Dr Mbega would even do house calls.  At some stage it became apparent that he was too ill, he was not even able to eat and we took him back to Baragwaneth.  On the fourth of September he died at Baragwaneth Hospital.",
