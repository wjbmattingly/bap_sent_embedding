As you have already said that Tom said that the dog is dead.  It is very painful that after he was murdered there was no court case.  You did not get any compensation as a family.  What Tom said that Andile is dead, it is very painful.  We thank you for coming here on behalf of your sister to tell the story to the Commission in order to show that Andile was not a dog, he was a human-being.  We, as the Commission, we will investigate about this matter.  We will make sure that the death of Andile will not be like the death of an animal.  We will try to ask Tom questions if he is still alive in order to know what was happening at that time.  Maybe Tom will know that the death of a person is very painful, it is not like the death of a dog.  We thank you very much.  We will come back to you to get some clarity on certain issues.  Thank you.",
