<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON: We will now call Kivi William Tyiwa, Mr Kivi William Tyiwa, Nokwaka Sylvia Nkwalase and Millicent Shumikazi Swartbooi.</p>

<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, let me lead Mr Tyiwa's evidence.  I will start with you Mr Tyiwa.  In which clan name are you, what is your clan name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I am Zikhali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> There is one Zikhali here in the panel.  Let me start by asking where you a member of any organisation while you were attacked or was there a conflict between organisations or were you just attacked by the criminals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I was a member of an organisation, I was a member of the ANC at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a> I was from Port Elizabeth at work, I came home at night at about nine to ten.  There were two of us.  When we were through the gates at Gonsi I was together with Mr Fani.  Two people came behind, they were in a hurry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a> Gantwani then said let us wait for this people to pass.  We then did, but they didn't pass, they came to us and they greeted us.  They addressed us as comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> We then agreed.  They asked us where we're coming from, we told them we are coming from Port Elizabeth.  They asked us where are we staying, we told them we are staying in the township.  I then told them that I was staying in the Dumba location. </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a> After that I heard sharp instrument on my head.  Gantwani managed to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you notice these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> No, they had balaclavas on.  They then ran away.  Reverend Hartland came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was he together with these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> No, he was driving a car.  He was the one who helped mr, Reverend Hartland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> They ran away and they ran to the tents of the Amagolota?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes, they ran away to the Amagolota tents.  The Reverend then took me to hospital.  I was admitted at the hospital.  It was during Easter weekend.  After the Easter weekend I was still in the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> In your statement you mentioned that you suspect that the people who attacked you are members of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes, they were members of the PAC, because they ran away to the Amagolota tent.  The Amagolota were members of the PAC.  Amagolota were PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> They ran away to the area of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you open a case concerning this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> No, because if you would go to Fort Beaufort to make a statement, the police would arrest you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> According to your knowledge,  were you</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>oppressed in the same way as the PAC by the Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> The PAC was working for De Klerk for the past Government because they were the ones who were assaulting us and attacking us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> The PAC says it is against the Whites, where you in conflict because of what was going on in the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes, because the PAC - there was a mayor in the township and the mayor was on the PAC side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Up until now, did you meet with the PAC and make peace?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes, today we are united.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What is your wish to the Commission, what would you like the Commission to do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I would like the Commission to assist me because I cannot work now.  My children are still at school and I am paying for my house.  I do get a pension fund, but sometimes it gets taken away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who takes it away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I don't know, but it was taken away and I received it last year again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How many children do you have?</p>

<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Is that all you wanted to say?</p>

<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MS NKWALASE:</span> I supported the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Where did this conflict come from which led to Luvuyo's shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MS NKWALASE:</span> In 1993 on a Sunday in February, Tamsanqa Duma's house had been set alight and this child was standing at the gate and when Zondani and them passed, going to that house, they shot at this child who was at the gate.  I was told that this child was still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Who was Tamsanqa?</p>

<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a> When we went to the hospital, we were told that he was in East London and we went back home.  When we got home, Mr Nqowe and Mr Sitini came to tell us that the child did not survive, that the child had passed away in the location already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you obtain a death certificate?</p>

<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were you able to establish who had shot at him?</p>

<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a> He came and told us to take it - to give a statement and that we were going to (indistinct) see court.  When we got there, the matter was postponed, and we were told that it was going to be heard in Fort Beaufort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a> The matter was heard in Fort Beaufort and thereafter, we were told that the people whom had shot the child, were going to be sentenced and that it was not necessary for us to come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were there people charged?</p>

<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>Biko because I was told that he had disappeared.  Whom I saw was Zondani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What can the Commission do for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS NKWALASE:</span> I ask that the Commission do for me whatever it can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Let us hear what your hopes are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS NKWALASE:</span> The Commission can help me because this child was an only child, his mother has been left childless.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you very much.  Is there nothing else you would like, is that all you have to say?  Is there nothing else you would like to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS NKWALASE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Thank you Chairman, I would like to go to Millicent Shumikazi Swartbooi.   Did this incident happen on the same day as the one we just heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> These people were just shooting?</p>

<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did you know who these people were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, they were known.  It was Eric Zondani and Vuyisile Biko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did they appear in court for these cases?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Were they sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> No, they were not sentenced.  They were represented by their Attorneys.  The Magistrate then said that - their Attorney didn't go to court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a> The Magistrate then said that he will sentence them if the lawyer does not appear.  The lawyer did go to court.  Eric Zondani was not found guilty.  Vuyisile Biko escaped.  REVD XUNDU: Both of them were not charged, that was the</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>end of the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, because Vuyisile escaped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> How old was Swelenkomo at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> I think he was 42 or 41 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Was he working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, he was working at Tubaletu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> You were a widow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> No, Swelenkomo was my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Where are his children now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> They are with his mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> Did he have a wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> No, he did not have a wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> What would you like the Commission to do for that family, for your brother's family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> We have a responsibility at home because my brother was the one was supporting us at home.  He was also supporting his child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a> We were victims of the struggle at that time.  The door at home was cracked, it was full of pellets.  There is nobody to build up our home, my brother was going to help us in that.  I am the one responsible for all the problems at home. </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a> I am also responsible for paying the rent at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> You want the Commission to assist you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS SWARTBOOI:</span> Yes, the Commission will see what to do for me.  We would like Vuyisile to come forward to tell the truth about what he did to my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">REVD XUNDU:</span> We will try to investigate about Vuyisile Biko.  Thank you.  The Commission will hand over this matter to the investigators so that we can find out the truth.  Mr Chairperson, I hand over to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ntsiki Sandi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Tyiwa, I have questions for you so that we can get clarity about this matter between PAC Amagolota and the Councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a> Let us start this way, as I was listening to all of you people from Fort Beaufort, most of the people in Fort Beaufort were members of the ANC, were supporters of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> There were people who were supporting the ANC, but on the other hand others were supporting PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you are talking about the PAC, were they the same people as Amagolota?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I can say so because they were staying on the same side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were they referring to themselves as PAC or were the people, the residents, referring to them, calling them PAC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes, because they were PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were they calling themselves PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they have meetings like any other organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> Yes, on their side they would call their meetings, they would not come to our ANC side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Were any other PAC leaders from other towns attend their meetings or their rallies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I don't know, because they were not holding the meetings on our ANC side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When all the organisations were unbanned in 1990, were there people from Fort  Beaufort who were calling themselves PAC, did they join PAC at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> You mean did they join PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did they go to Parliament in Cape Town or in Bisho to represent PAC amongst these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR TYIWA:</span> I don't know, but what I know is that there was conflict in the township.  There was a PAC side and the ANC side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We thank you sir and we also thank the ladies next to you.  The conflict that was between the PAC and the UDF and between the PAC and the ANC, this caused many people to be injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a> Some of them lost their husbands and this Commission has to look into that.  It is true that there was a third force in all these situations.  We hope that the documents that the Commission has received, these days the documents explaining about the involvement of third force, will help us in trying to clarify this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a> But I think that it is the truth from which we cannot run away that in the history of this country, there was a political intolerance and this led to Black communities suffering and there were many people who lost their family members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a> I hope that the PAC side will come to the Commission to present their side of the story.
