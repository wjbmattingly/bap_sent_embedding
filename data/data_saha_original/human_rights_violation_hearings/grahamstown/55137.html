<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EDWARD GUGWANA MENZI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MBULELO MENZI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you.  I will now ask you questions.  Briefly, I would like you to give me a picture of what was happening at that time so that I can ask questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> In 1986 in Cookhouse there was an organisation by the name of KORA.  The organisation was launched in 1985 by the community.  In 1986 we were together with the Kakana family in this organisation.  The Kakana family had their meetings and the community did not like that.  Mr Kakana had, was the owner of a shop and one, Mr Xhalanga, also had a shop.  He was together with them.  People were told not to buy in Xhalanga's shop and Kakana's shop.  As I was also having a shop they thought that I was the one who influenced people not to buy in their shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a> On the 27th of February in 1986,  this young man next to me, Mbulelo, called me and he say, father, in Xhalanga's shop he heard a gossip about me, but he did not tell me exactly what was said.  As we were in the shop with my wife, together with Mangoweni's boy, young men came.  I asked them what was happening.  They said that they were seeing Kakana's family.  As I was still looking at that I saw a group of men coming in.  I did not see what they had in their hands.  I looked at them, they took out their weapons.  Some had pangas and hammers.  There was Xolisile and Sicuku Jantjies.  They came to me with their weapons.  I  ran to the storeroom.  I took one empty drink bottle.  I did not want to give them my bag.  I ran to a corner, but I thought that that will not help me, I must go back to them.  I fell down, they came to me and they stabbed me in the back.  I was dizzy at that time.  There was one of them, Boom, with a sword and he stabbed me in the back.  I fell down.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> In the community there was an AZAPO and UDF, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> They were calling themselves AZAPO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was it recently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes, it was a recent thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You said that you were belonging to a same organisation KORA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> But they have changed and they called themselves AZAPO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes, they had their own meetings and they called themselves AZAPO members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You mentioned Xhalanga.  Was he in connection with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes, Xhalanga had a connection with the police.  There is a bridge from Cookhouse.  One day I was passing in that bridge.  He was there with the police.  I decided to go back.  When I was going back the police van was leaving.  I met him in one meeting because he was attending our meetings.  He said to me, you saw me when I was talking to the police.  I said, yes.  He said that the police wanted to know our involvement in the organisation.  I could see that he was just trying to cover for himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was AZAPO a launched organisation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> I do not know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you have a position in the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No, I was just a member of this Cradock organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were you a Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No, I was just a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> This conflict divided people in the community.  Others were AZAPO members and others were UDF members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> People who were members of AZAPO were Kakana family and Sicuku Jantjies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> When these people were assaulting Nomakhaya Shlanya, please tell us about this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> When I went out of the storeroom, it was the same day, I met people outside.  I asked them to give me a towel to bandage my head.  They gave me a towel.  I asked where my wife was.  They told me she was in the shop.  When I went in the shop I saw a pool of blood.   She was lying down.  I decided to follow these people.  I went to my house looking for my own weapons.  Thosameli Sigwebu came, he said that you are injured.  He took my wife to hospital.   He said that I must go to hospital because I was injured.  I then agreed, he took me to hospital and I was told that Nomakhaya died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did the police come to take statements to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> The police came the following day when I was coming from the hospital.  It was on the 28th.  When I arrived at the hospital I was told my wife had passed away.  I was released the following morning by the doctor.  When I arrived at home the police came.  They asked me how I felt.  I said I was still in pain.  They told me when I was feeling better I must go to the police station to tell them what happened.  I wanted to know at home what happened when I left.  They told me that the police did not come.  They came at night at about 12, because Kakana Dickie was shot.  They took this Dickie with a van.  It was then that the police came.  I was not there, but my boy told me.  I could see that the police did not care, because they did not come when we were injured, they only came when Dickie was injured.  One police came, Blackies, came to me saying that I must give them a statement.  I told him I am not going to do that, I want another police to come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did that police come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No, but he met my son.  He asked a statement from my son and that was the end of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Was there a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Did you go to any Attorneys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> The people who entered your shop, did you know all of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> I know Boom, Sicuku Jantjies, Kolisile, Kakana, Mpendulo Kakana, Mongamela Kakana, Madusa Kakana.  Those were the ones who came in the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You buried your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Were you disrupted by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No, but they were just there to observe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> After that you went back to your normal lives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> After the funeral the community decided to chase away the Kakana family from the township.  They stayed near the police station.  Their shops were burnt, Xhalanga's shop and Kakana's shop.  The people from the community could not go near the police station because they would be harassed by these two families.  People were not allowed to or have weapons, but the Kakana family had weapons.  There were people like Madusa who were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> After all this did the Kakana family go back to the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes, they came back to the township at the time of the State of Emergency.  I heard that they had a high fence so that the people from the community cannot go in.  They came to me, the woman of Kakana's family, came to me to apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Are you still in Cookhouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Still continuing with your shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> The ones who came to you, who assaulted you, did they come to apologise to you, these men you have just mentioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> No, some of them are in Fort Beaufort, some of them have passed away, but they did not come to me to apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Only their wives came to you to apologise.   You, as men, you still have conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> I am not satisfied, because the people who assaulted me did not come to me and apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> The police that took statement from your son, what did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> They did nothing, they just took a statement from my  son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What is your request to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> My request to the Commission, as we were being chased away, there were people who were hired, they were known as "Specials".  One of them is a policeman today.  I would like the Government to do something about these people, because they were hired by the past Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> You said that he is here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> Yes, he is here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> What did you say about these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> I said that the Government must see what to do about these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Except for that, what is your other request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> There is nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Is there peace amongst you and the families of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR E G MENZI:</span> We are happy, there is no conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mbulelo, do you have anything else to add in your father's story?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR M MENZI:</span> What I would like the Commission to do, as this was a very painful thing that happened to us, if one can sit down and watch what was happening, it was like a butchery, because there was blood all over.  My mother left two young children, they need their mother, they need the discipline, to be disciplined by their mother.  I would like the Commission to prosecute the people, the perpetrators, because if you say you forgive them, but you have a grudge, that will not be acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> In other words, you say that these people must be brought forward to the Law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR M MENZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR M MENZI:</span> Yes, that is all, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you, Mr Menzi, and you, Mbulelo.  This must have been a very painful day to you.  Your wife was killed, you were also badly injured and you nearly died.  This is clearly a painful day for you, but I do not want to comment beyond that at this stage.  I would like to call the next witnesses who will be giving us the other side of the story.  For now, we thank you.</p>
