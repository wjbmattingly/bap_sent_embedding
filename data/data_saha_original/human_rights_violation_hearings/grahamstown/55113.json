We gave our constitution to the detectives, at that time Wessels and Ghani and Makline, because we wanted them to know that there is an affiliation of UDF in Adelaide and we were members of that organisation.  There was also a student organisation, COSAS, in Adelaide.  One of the students was arrested.  It was on a Monday when the student was arrested.  He was taken to the police station.  The police were arresting him because he was one of the people who attended a meeting. When the students went to ask the police why the student was arrested, the police said that they found drugs, dagga, in him.\n In 1985, on the tenth, the youth were toy-toying and singing freedom songs in the streets.  At about 20 past seven up to eight o' clock the two policemen who stayed in our same street, three gunshots, we heard three gunshots.  One of the students by the name of Themba Letu Tikane was killed.  At that time I was not aware that there were people who were injured.  I went home, I had dinner, my friend came at about 12, after 12 at night.  There were three policemen. I was together with Mondi Nkonki.  They were beating us. They took me out of the room.  When I was out of the room I saw that there were soldiers outside and there were two police vans.  There were cars and an ambulance.  They were beating me and assaulting me all the time.",

A person who is not aware of this, for example, the killing of Andile Kiva, Andile Ndyebi and other people who were assaulted, we did not expect this to happen, because the police came with their uniforms.  I left home on that Saturday, because I was aware that when the police came in their uniforms they were going to do such incidents.  Many people were killed because they were not aware.
