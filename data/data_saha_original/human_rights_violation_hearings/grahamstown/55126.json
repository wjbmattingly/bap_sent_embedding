At the time when he was still at home he was talking about the political situation and also the youth and it was apparent to me that they were having meetings, they were known as COSAS and some of the other boys that use to come and see him, one of them is here.  They use to like to come to my place and while they were there, detectives came there and they were arrested.  After their arrest they were photographed and, from what I hear, he played an important role in the meetings and the organisations, because people said that he was very active.  Thereafter, I was worried about this, but there was no way I could stop him because they were fighting for a worthy cause.\n Then the police came with sjamboks, it was late at night and I was fairly intoxicated.  They came there and they said they were looking for Siphiwo and I said there is no Siphiwo here.  I said there is a Sipho Kolisi and they said, yes, that is the person we are looking for.  I said, look, you were looking for Siphiwo, there is no Siphiwo here, my child's name is Sipho Kolisi.  They left and Sipho came back.  I said to him, listen, the detectives are looking for you and he said, oh dad, and I said, look boy, the detectives are looking for you, see what you can do.  He disappeared and I discovered that, I later heard that they were sleeping at St Pauls College where some priests were and the police did not stop harassing us at home, looking for them armed with sjamboks and threatening to arrest and threatened me as well, saying that, Mdala, we are going to assault you as well and I said, you will never do that.

His mother would agree with him and say, leave the child, if he feels this way, let it be.  When he left he said, mum, I am leaving.  We are very oppressed in this country and we are battling here at home and the Boers are oppressing us like you will not believe, but I am going to come back and when I get back you will have everything.

Your son died while fighting for the liberation of this country and he will be counted as heroes of the new South Africa.  We have taken note of your request that his remains be found and be laid to rest in an appropriate manner.  These requests are always raised by people who appear before the Commission, where they request that heroes who have fallen in Angola, Lesotho, Zambia, Mozambique and such places, the bones of heroes who died during the struggle for liberation, remains be brought back to be given a fit and proper burial.  We have heard that request before and we take note of yours and on behalf of this Commission we would like to thank you for being the type of father that you are and for still being able to come here in spite of the loss of your wife as well.  We will include your request in our report and we thank you.",
