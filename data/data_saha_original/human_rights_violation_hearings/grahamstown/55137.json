            "In 1986 in Cookhouse there was an organisation by the name of KORA.  The organisation was launched in 1985 by the community.  In 1986 we were together with the Kakana family in this organisation.  The Kakana family had their meetings and the community did not like that.  Mr Kakana had, was the owner of a shop and one, Mr Xhalanga, also had a shop.  He was together with them.  People were told not to buy in Xhalanga's shop and Kakana's shop.  As I was also having a shop they thought that I was the one who influenced people not to buy in their shops.\n On the 27th of February in 1986,  this young man next to me, Mbulelo, called me and he say, father, in Xhalanga's shop he heard a gossip about me, but he did not tell me exactly what was said.  As we were in the shop with my wife, together with Mangoweni's boy, young men came.  I asked them what was happening.  They said that they were seeing Kakana's family.  As I was still looking at that I saw a group of men coming in.  I did not see what they had in their hands.  I looked at them, they took out their weapons.  Some had pangas and hammers.  There was Xolisile and Sicuku Jantjies.  They came to me with their weapons.  I  ran to the storeroom.  I took one empty drink bottle.  I did not want to give them my bag.  I ran to a corner, but I thought that that will not help me, I must go back to them.  I fell down, they came to me and they stabbed me in the back.  I was dizzy at that time.  There was one of them, Boom, with a sword and he stabbed me in the back.  I fell down.",
