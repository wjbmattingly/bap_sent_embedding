They were found not guilty and he was discharged, but even then the security police were after him.  He could not go to town, they would chase him.  So, we ultimately fled to PE with some other pupils to go and join their Comrades in PE.  He was shot there while he was setting a bakery delivery vehicle alight.\n We had asked a neighbour of ours, Mr Mdana, Nane Mdana, to make arrangements for the funeral, but Nane, he was detained on a daily basis.  Makwenkwe was shot on the 15th of March 1978 in PE.  Nane was detained on a daily basis from the 16th to the 25th.  I think the security police must have heard that he is organising the funeral and he was only let free on that Thursday, the day of the funeral, a day imposed on us by them.  Makwenkwe, when Makwenkwe died, he died nine months after the birth of his daughter, Phumeza, who is still with me and whom I have adopted legally.  She is at technical college and I am fully responsibility.  She is under my care, being a widower and a pensioner.",

To see you shed tears makes us realise, again, the price that mothers had to pay for the freedom, for the liberation of our land.  Mothers paid, indeed, the highest price, because in most of the cases they did not even know what their sons were doing and they had to be confronted by dead bodies which they had to collect and bury like you did to Makwenkwe.  We wish to convey, on behalf of the Commission, our deepest sympathy and an assurance that we will, as far as we are able, pursue every case that is placed before us.  There is, of course, no guarantee that we will be able to solve every case.  We are beginning to realise that there are a number of cases which are going to remain unsolved given the time allocated to us as a\nCommission, but we are grateful that you have brought this case to us and we will do what we can to answer the questions that you have raised in your statement.  I do wish, however, to point out that our office has noted that your statement is very scanty, that they would like to have more information, more background information than is provided in the statement.  So, I wish that, perhaps, as you are led down from the stand, somebody from the staff of the Commission must sit down with you and, indeed, get the details which are essential for us to have if we are to have any meaningful investigation of your matter.  For now, we salute you and we thank you for coming to testify.",
