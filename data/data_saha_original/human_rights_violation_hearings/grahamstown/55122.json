At the time of the funeral, we buried him.  Our church, our congregation, the Methodist Church did not take part in the funeral, but we, up until today we do not know the reason for that.\n As the time went by we stayed at home.  We did not isolate ourselves from the people, we were amongst the people in every activity in Cookhouse.  I did not belong to any other member, but what, the organisation I belonged to was the Resident's Organisation. We were playing rugby together with the men who testified before me.  We played for the same team, but I changed to another team.  The time went by. This incident happened when my mother's sister's son was killed.  After that there was this conflict.  There was no reason for that.  Nobody was asking questions, we were not asking questions to each other, but fortunately or unfortunately the wife of the man who testified before use to come to me, because I was selling veg.  She use to come to me for advice and I would give her advice, but this conflict came.  I heard that UDF and AZAPO were mentioned.  I was not a member of AZAPO.  If there were any AZAPO meetings, maybe they were held in Xhalanga's house.\n One teacher, Nyelake's teacher, was killed.  He was stabbed in the house.  After that he was taken out to be burnt.",

This will make us very glad.  I want to thank you for coming here with this painful story.  People died during that time in your family.  I want to say that all unnecessary loss of precious life and, as we are the Commission, any loss of life is a loss too much.  It is painful to lose a life, it is more painful when it happens within our own communities.  In your community, as I have already said, when we counted people who died in Kakana and also in the Menzi family, this is very painful.  I do not know whether we will be able to deal with your request that we must try to make peace in your families.  I do not want to promise anything, but it will be one of the things we report to the Commission.  We would follow Dr Vosloo, because what he has given out to the country, that you have been bought by this amount of money, you were trained as the Kakana family, we have to follow and investigate about all this.  We have to know whether it was the truth or a lie.  If it is a lie, he has to come forward and say it.  We thank you all.  We hope that if we had a, if we are going to have a chance we will meet with the two families.   We will now adjourn and we will meet tomorrow.  We will start at nine o' clock tomorrow morning.
