<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Let us begin with Mrs Nongazi Lillian Mata.  You made a request, Mam, to appear in front of the Commission to talk about your child who was shot in 1985.  He was shot in Joza township.  What is her name.  Is she Hombakazi Matiwane.  Can you explain, Mam, without me interrupting you, telling us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATA:</span> Hombakazi left home and she went to church.  When she arrived there, there was nobody.  All the people went to the funeral.  She went to Joza and she passed, she went to her aunties house and then from there she went to the stadium looking for her cousin so that they can go together to the funeral.  She then got shot when they were coming from the funeral.  They were from the stadium.  I do not know what happened because I was not Joza at that time, but they were shot before reaching the graveyard.  It was on Sunday, this funeral was on Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Who shot Hombakazi, did you hear the person's name who shot your daughter, who shot Hombakazi?</p>

<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> By coming here in this Commission, Mrs Mata, do  you have a request?</p>

<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> In your statement when you were asked this question you responded by saying you want the funeral expenses to be covered.  Do you remember that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You made a request when you were giving your statement, a request that you would like the children who were injured in this way, in the way which Hombakazi got injured, you want their names to be recorded.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you have anything else to add to your requests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATA:</span> No, I have nothing to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all, Mrs Mata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MATA:</span> Yes, that is all.  I have nothing to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you Mrs Mata.  Let us now go to Mr Toyi.  Mr Toyi, you were not shot on that day, but people like Hombakazi died as a result of this they cannot come here today to tell us what happened.  Can you please tell us, briefly, what happened on this day, Mr Toyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Thank you Mr Sandi and the panel.  On the fourth of April 1985 we attended a funeral, Tamsane Stevens funeral, this was held in JD Lebu stadium.  When we left the stadium on our way to the graveyard, when we were about to  reach Joza township we found four policemen, one of them is Diliza, who is Mrs Nana.  Mrs Nana was one of the councillors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You were passing Mrs Nana's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> When we were passing this house I was holding my friend's hand.  The police shot us, at us, we ran away.  When I was about to reach a corner I was shot in my back and I fell down, but I managed to go to one yard, but Dunjwa came in.  I was lying down at the time, he was shooting at us.  I managed to go through the door.  Diliza came with a gun.  He broke the window with the back of the rifle.  I told him to break all the windows.  He insulted me and he put a gun in my neck.  I stopped talking.  After a while a casspir came, after a Casspir and then an ambulance came.  I was taken to the hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a> When I arrived there in the hospital there was one small room.  There was a coloured guy sleeping there.  He was dead at the time and one young lady and one police, white policeman.  I was taken to the ward.  This guy, white guy, took out hand-cuffs and hand-cuffed me.  The nurses asked him why are you hand-cuff, why do you hand-cuff him, because he cannot run away and he said that it was the Law, He was supposed to hand-cuff me.  One coloured man came to guard me.  He would change the hand-cuffs, he would hand-cuff me, my one hand to the, with the bed.  I stayed for two weeks in the hospital.  In the third week I was taken to the charge office, but when I was discharged there was a lawyer hired, Mr B Sandi.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a> On Monday I was released on bail.  I went to visit Mr Sandi.  He then transferred me to one lady to give out a statement to her.  This lady told me to consult a doctor in order to get a paper from the doctor, because we were trying to claim.  We then managed to get a doctor.  The doctor gave me tablets and some medicine.  We then went back to Mr Sandi with the paper from the doctor.  The case then continued.  They would postpone the case now and then.  If I am not mistaken it was in September, but I do not remember the date when the case, when we heard that the case was withdrawn.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> This case, were you accused of anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What were you accused of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> They said that we stoned Diliza's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What then happened to the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> They told us that we, they will call us again.  I waited and waited and I waited for my lawyer to call me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How were you injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I was injured very badly especially in my legs.  As I result I have pellets embedded in my body.  I would not like to mention the state of my health because the bullets are all over my body, even in my private parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Before you got injured what were you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I was covering, I was in upholstery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Could you continue your work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> No, I could not.  I was unable to continue working because my working as an upholsterer required me to bend quite often and I suffered back problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you recall which requests you made when you submitted your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Could you just elaborate on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Mr Plaatjie asked me what I would like the Commission to do for me.  I did not make any request at the time I submitted my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When asked this question you said that you are now unable to work towards any income for yourself.  Is that a way of making some kind of request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which request is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I would ask that the Commission assist me in any way, even if it is the education of my children, because I have four children who need to be educated.  Some of them have passed their matric and are unable to proceed with their education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What standard are these children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> They are, four of them are not at school.  The one is at technikon and my wife and mother-in-law help me with the child and the other one is in matric.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all you would like to say, Mr Toyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> No that is not all, Mr Sandi.  When the case failed in the hands of Mr Sandi I went to the Legal Resource Centre and they told me to write to the Law Society and state what happened to my matter and they responded, I wrote to the Law Society after five years and they responded by saying that my file would not be able to be traced after five years and I then left the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a> I then came to the Legal Aid Clinic and stated my case and I was assisted by an elderly man who listened to my story and said, look, we would advise you to just let this case go, because it is an old matter.  If it was approximately three years old you could have had a chance.  I said to him, look, if a woman had shot me I would have let the matter be, but a man shot me and I am going to retaliate if I see him anywhere.  From there I tried to deal with this and last year I came back to the Legal Resource Centre where I met a young man who advised me to go back to the Law Society.  I told him that I had written to the Law Society and he then said I am afraid we will not be able to do anything for you, because the matter is quite old and I said, look, as men, if you assault me I am going to retaliate at some stage or another in whatever way.  He said to me you will be arrested and I said you will be the witness.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Mr Toyi, if I hear you correctly, you are saying in your statement that we would have to go to Mr Sandi and find out what went wrong in this matter.  Is that what you are trying to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> No, it is not that I want the matter referred back to Mr Sandi so that they could investigate what went wrong, I am just saying what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all you would like to say here, Mr Toyi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs June Crichton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Toyi, can you hear me?  Earlier in the proceedings today our Commissioner mentioned that we would be having a hearing later about situations in hospitals that were co-operating with the State.  Now, you were hand-cuffed to your bed and that was an abnormal position to be kept in just as people were made to stand for lengthy periods or kept in abnormal positions in prison.  Who said to you that it was the Law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> The policeman whom I encountered sitting with the bereaved widow and the coloured lady.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> And the nursing staff, did they ever say anything to you about it being the Law?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> No, the nurses did not want me to be hand-cuffed to the bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Do you know the name of the doctor who was responsible for your case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Would you recognise him if you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I could attempt to recognise him although at the time he was fairly aged.  I do not know what he would look like today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Thank you Mr Toyi.  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Toyi, how many people died in this incident where the police shot people that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I am aware of two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> One of them is the daughter of Mrs Mata.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I could agree, because since having heard her testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see her the day she was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> I saw her in hospital, but she was already deceased at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you all at the same funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes, we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we then assume that you agree with Mrs Mata that her daughter was shot in that conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the other two you referred to, what were their names, if you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Alistair Godman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alistair Cole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Yes, he is the coloured boy who died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We would like to thank both of you for your testimony.  The requests which you have submitted before us we will include in our report and relay them to Mr Sandi who was the attorney dealing with your matter at the time and, even though you have not asked us to go back to him, we will have to enquire in an attempt to establish what happened, because that is the concept of accountability which is very important in our society today, so that people can come to terms with these things.  We will also go to the hospital which you spoke about and where you say you made a statement.  I will use this forum to say to them that they have heard the allegation made against them with regards to what happened in that hospital.  We thank you.  You may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR TOYI:</span> Excuse me, Sir, I have a problem.  I have been to doctors, not one of them can assist me.  They say that these pellets will remain in my body for life.  The pain which I experience is not due to the pellets.  Now I have given up on medical assistance, but I am still very ill.  I would like to ask the Commission to assist me with regards to my health.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We thank you, Mr Toyi, for mentioning that to us and listening to your testimony and Mrs Mata's testimony, even if it is not clear to you, it is clear to her that she is very disturbed and Reverend Xundu who is on my far left will send people to meet with you and see what kind of assistance can be granted, what kind of urgent interim relief can be granted to people like yourself who appear before the Commission to put them in contact with doctors until such time as we have finalised our report and submitted it to the President.</p>
