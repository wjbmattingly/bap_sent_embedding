<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  While you are standing Lindile Watson Kolisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">LINDILE WATSON KOLISI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> The witness has been duly sworn in, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  We would like to welcome you Mr Kolisi.  We are now going to hand you over to Mr Ntsikelelo Sandi who will lead your evidence by way of a few questions on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Kolisi, you have requested to appear before this Commission and come and speak about your son Sipho Victor Kolisi.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Let us speak very briefly about your son, Sipho.  You said that he left here to join the ANC abroad.  In which year was that?  Did you say that was in 1985?  According to your statement, you said 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> How old was he, was he at school or was he working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> He was still at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What standard was he in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> He was in standard eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was his age at the time of his disappearance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> He was still very young.  Besides the fact that he was very young, I would like to get into my story.  At the time when he was still at home he was talking about the political situation and also the youth and it was apparent to me that they were having meetings, they were known as COSAS and some of the other boys that use to come and see him, one of them is here.  They use to like to come to my place and while they were there, detectives came there and they were arrested.  After their arrest they were photographed and, from what I hear, he played an important role in the meetings and the organisations, because people said that he was very active.  Thereafter, I was worried about this, but there was no way I could stop him because they were fighting for a worthy cause.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a> Then the police came with sjamboks, it was late at night and I was fairly intoxicated.  They came there and they said they were looking for Siphiwo and I said there is no Siphiwo here.  I said there is a Sipho Kolisi and they said, yes, that is the person we are looking for.  I said, look, you were looking for Siphiwo, there is no Siphiwo here, my child's name is Sipho Kolisi.  They left and Sipho came back.  I said to him, listen, the detectives are looking for you and he said, oh dad, and I said, look boy, the detectives are looking for you, see what you can do.  He disappeared and I discovered that, I later heard that they were sleeping at St Pauls College where some priests were and the police did not stop harassing us at home, looking for them armed with sjamboks and threatening to arrest and threatened me as well, saying that, Mdala, we are going to assault you as well and I said, you will never do that.  They would then leave.  After a while my child disappeared and I did not see him again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Before he left, did he ever say, mention to you that he had any intention of leaving this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> His mother was alive at the time and he would mention it to his mother, but he would not say that to me, because he knew that I was very strict when it came to his school education.  I would have said to him that he was still too young to participate in politics and he would say to me, dad, I prefer to die for my country, for the liberation of my country.  His mother would agree with him and say, leave the child, if he feels this way, let it be.  When he left he said, mum, I am leaving.  We are very oppressed in this country and we are battling here at home and the Boers are oppressing us like you will not believe, but I am going to come back and when I get back you will have everything.  That is what he said to his mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did you ever establish whom he left with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> He left with Mankayi's son who is a soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> And Tony Yaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Yes, they all left together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> There was a third person who you mentioned in your statement, Mzimasi Ncapayi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> I think it was he, he was one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> After his disappearance did he ever send messages home or write or phone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> He wrote a letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> I cannot recall dates very well, but I am sure about that.  What one has to be sure about besides the date is that you are sure that you received this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> If I can remind you, according to your statement, you, it was in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> I took the letter and read it and it said, mum and dad, I am still alive and I am happy and I would be very happy if you were also well, I am very happy.  There was no address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was there ever another letter or any other communication thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Thereafter all was quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The guys that he left with, they came back, did they come and tell you where your son was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> What is amazing is that I heard that these boys know what happened to my son.  They were all together, they left together.  The day a ritual was performed at the Mankayi home, where a cow was slaughtered, they went there and they participated in eating the meat and things like that and I was asking Mr Mankayi, Mankayi, your son was with my son.  He said, yes, they were all there, they were eating meat at the ritual and they did say that they were going to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Did any others come to your house thereafter from the organisation which your son went to join, coming to tell you what happened to your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Some men came from the ANC and came to tell us that Sipho Kolisi had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you remember who these men were, did they identify themselves to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> I still remember who they are.  It was shortly after I had buried my wife and I was still grieving the loss of my wife.  While I was sitting there with the priest, somebody came to call me.  They were a, they were not too keen to tell me, because I was still grieving and I went to them and said, look, tell me what is it and they said, look, we hate to be the bearers of bad news especially in your grief and the priest said, look, let us pray.  We prayed and prayed and I looked around and I was very anxious and they said, Mr Kolisi, your wife is deceased, you have a son by the name Sipho and I said, yes, what is wrong with my son.  They said, please do not get too upset and I asked for a glass of water and then they informed me that my son was also dead.  I cried out, oh my God, why did you not rather take me first so that I did not even know where he was buried.  The priest consoled me and said you are a Christian, you are born again and you have to be strong and I said to him that this, it was quite apparent that this child died while my wife was still alive.  I said that I realised that this child who had died while my wife was still alive ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You may take your time, Mr Kolisi, I will wait.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> ... and I wanted to know why God had not rather taken me first, what had I done, what was this great sin which I had committed, because my wife had just died in a car accident and now it was my son.  It is better if you just take me as well.  The priest comforted me and I then went home, because we were at the priest's house that morning.  It was the Reverend Changena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You have a request here with regards to the remains of your son.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What is that request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> I heard, I have a wish that the ANC, at least, make means for me to have back the remains of my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that all you would like to say in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> No, I have not finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> I would like to say that since this happened to my son, something else I would like to know is whether there cannot be an investigation into trying to establish who shot my child.  Secondly, I saw something on TV where people's bones were being exhumed, where it was said that they had been shot by the Boers and their remains were being exhumed and that brought to mind my son.  It is my son's situation, because I was only informed years after that and another man from Port Elizabeth had also come there to tell me that your son died in the line of duty.  He was a hero and we are going to include his name in the naming of streets, because he died in the line of duty as a soldier.  I would say that that is all I have to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you very much, Mr Kolisi.  Perhaps there are questions which my colleagues would like to put to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Reverend Xundu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Sir, I would like to know from you, did you ever go to the ANC office and try and establish where this boy died and which organisation he belonged to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOLISI:</span> Reverend, I would say that it, these men who had come there said that he fell or he had fallen around the Messina area during combat.  That is what they said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Thank you Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kolisi, thank you very much.  You have painted a very clear picture of a young man who was also a hero, that was your son, Sipho.  A young man who died in the struggle, who grew up as part of the struggle and we find that during the relating of your story, there are certain parts which disturb you although we do not feel that, parents like yourself should not be disturbed by what happened to your children, but you should know what happened to your children, because you should know that your children did not die in vain.  Your son died while fighting for the liberation of this country and he will be counted as heroes of the new South Africa.  We have taken note of your request that his remains be found and be laid to rest in an appropriate manner.  These requests are always raised by people who appear before the Commission, where they request that heroes who have fallen in Angola, Lesotho, Zambia, Mozambique and such places, the bones of heroes who died during the struggle for liberation, remains be brought back to be given a fit and proper burial.  We have heard that request before and we take note of yours and on behalf of this Commission we would like to thank you for being the type of father that you are and for still being able to come here in spite of the loss of your wife as well.  We will include your request in our report and we thank you.</p>
