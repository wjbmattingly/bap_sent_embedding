As time went by you found that all these prisoners suffered from runny tummies.  Everyone had diarrhoea.  At that stage if, it seemed as if someone fell out of the queue to go and relieve themselves they would assault the person with their rifle butts and say carry on walking.   Coming back to your question, there was a doctor available, Drs van Zyl and someone by the name of Tiza and they did what you asked me not to mention here.  That was the first time we had encountered that and it disturbed us, because other members of the ANC came, Masondo was a lecturer at Fort Hare and Rex Mbonwane and Mdinghy and two others from Port Elizabeth, George Nsikankantla.  We were all together in the segregation cell, but what happened was while we were all there together we as political prisoners would be released with the convicts.\n On the 22nd of October 1963 we were released.  My appeal was successful, but and I was supposed to have been released in April 1962, but I was only released in October 1963.  I then decided to go to Lesotho and go and give a report where our organisation was legal.  I then went to Lesotho where I submitted my report and it was realised there and then that it was dangerous, that it would surface at the United Nations in 1963, if I am not mistaken.
