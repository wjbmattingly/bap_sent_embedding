It was about ten or 11 in the morning.  In the afternoon at about two I heard that there was shooting in the township.  I had a small baby at the time.  My baby had nine months, was nine months old.  I took my baby and I wanted to see who was shooting.  I could see from the other side.  I saw Michael Sinqana coming from the township together with his girlfriend Nokazola.  I asked\nthem where my husband was.  They told me that, no, he was on his way to town.  \n When I was going to the township trying to find out what was happening, one woman took my baby.  I saw that the way many people, a group of people in the field.  Someone was being beaten up.  I could see a white thing, because my husband was wearing a white trouser my mind told me that he was the one who was being beaten up.  I then met Dugard Mlsholana, I asked him where my husband was.  He told me he was coming, they left him there.  The Casper then appeared and it went to the field.  Many people dispersed.  When I was trying to go there one soldier stopped me.  He asked me to tell him what clothes my husband was wearing.  I told him that he was wearing a white trouser, brown belt and he looked at me, he shook his head.  Sergeant Brown who was also a Municipal Police came driving a police van.  At that time I could not think properly.  My sister ran away, she ran to this thing.  \n When my sister arrived there, she came back to me and she told me that he is still alive and I told myself that I was going to ask him why you did not listen to me, because I told him not to go to the township.  This soldier shook his head.  Sergeant Brown took me to the hospital.  They said that my husband was in a Casper and I was in police van together with Sergeant Brown.  Dr Letaga came in hospital with an injection.  He asked me how was your husband. I told him that we were co-operating with my husband.  We were, we had a good relationship, he was listening to me.  Dr Letaga told me that my husband was dead.  He gave me this injection and he told them to take me to bed.  \n I could not sleep.  I heard my baby crying.  My child \nwas brought to me by the woman who took him from me.  I asked the doctor to release me on the following day to be with my baby.  I do not know what else happened, but we buried him.  When the case was investigated I heard that the person who killed him was Fafa.  Nobody came to me to tell me directly who killed my husband.  I just heard that it was Fafa.  That was all I knew about the case.  I was again informed that an identity document was also found on the body by Mxolisi Gazi.  \n There was one day when we were called by the Magistrate by the name of Terblanche.  The case was examined.  Michael Sinqana, Dugard Mlsholana were there.  After that day we were told that the people who killed him were not found.",

            "I want to thank the three of you because you agreed to testify together.  I think this is the first time such a thing happened in this region, the Eastern Cape region.  Mrs Mketshane was the wife of a police who took part in shooting your family members, Mrs Sabani and you, Zoleka.  I think this is wonderful that you have agreed to come forward together, to testify together.  You have shown a pain is a pain.  If you were others, you will not agree to testify with Mrs Mketshane, but you have agreed to come forward together with her.  You have shown us that killing a person does not take sides.  We also thank Ntombizodwa Mketshane because she promised that as Zoleka wanted to know the details of her brother's death, she promised that she will help in investigating.  You also made peace amongst each other.  When my colleague asked you how you felt, you said that there was peace amongst you.  This is a good example.  We thank you for that.  We would like this example to be followed by other people, to accept the pain as you did.  We thank you people from Adelaide.",
