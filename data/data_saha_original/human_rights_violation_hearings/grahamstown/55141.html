<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mandlakayise Matu Mphithi, please stand up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">REV XUNDU:</span> Mr Chairman, he has been properly sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We welcome you, Mandlakayise.  We will ask Tiny Maya to lead you with questions on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Mandlakayise, according to your statement in front of us, you are going to tell us about three incidents that happened to you.  Two of them happened on the 8th of May 1985 where you were tortured by the police in Bedford.  You were also chopped off two fingers.  The third one is about the State Emergency in 1986.  Please tell us briefly what happened to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> In 1985, in 1985 in Bedford I was on my way to shop, to the coloured area.  At the time there was a consumer boycott.  I went from the township to the coloured area.  When I arrived there in the shop, one person came out of the shop.  He came to me, he said that, Comrade, I just want to know one thing, let us go outside.  We went out.  I did not ask what was it, I just went out with him.  I told him to hurry up, because I wanted to buy something in the shop.  When he arrived outside he said that you are one of the people who destroyed my food.  It was dark at the shop, when I went out I saw him taking out a knife.  I tried to</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>defend myself, I thought it was abating, because it was dark.  He cut, he chopped me and he ran away.  After that I went back, I ran back to the shop.  When I looked at my hand, my fingers were chopped.  The owner of the shop tried to help me, he tried to block the blood.  He phoned the ambulance, he phoned again the ambulance for the second time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a> When the ambulance arrived they told me, they told him that they cannot take me to hospital.  They told the owner of the shop to phone the police.  The owner of the shop told them that he will pay them R10,00 to take me to hospital.  He paid them this R10,00 and they took me to hospital.  When I arrived in hospital the police also arrived.  They wanted to talk to me.  I told them that I cannot talk to them, because I was in pain.  I told them to come the following day.  They left.  The following morning they came back in hospital.  They asked me whether I was laying a charge against the person who did this to me.  I said, yes, but I will lay a charge when I would be, when I was out of hospital.  They asked me to give them a statement.  I said that I do not have a statement to give them.  I will go to them and give a statement when I was released from hospital.  The doctors took me to the theatre to operate me.  I stayed for two weeks and the third week, when I was going to the township, I met police in their Hippo.  People were running away.  I was still in pain at that time.  When I tried to run away the police came.  They took me to the Hippo.  When I was in that Hippo they kicked me although I was coming from the hospital.  They arrested me.  I was in pain and I told them that I was sick, I was not well.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Let us go back.  At the time you were in a shop,</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>did you know the person who took you outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> Yes, I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> It was Gideon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who was Gideon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> He was a coloured man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Why did he take you out of the shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> I do not know, because he said to me he wanted to ask me something concerning being a Comrade.  When I wanted to know what it was he took out a knife.  When I tried to defend myself he cut my fingers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Did you lay a charge against him to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Why did you not lay a charge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Why did you not lay a charge against him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> When I was released from the hospital I went to the police.  I told them I wanted to lay a charge.  They just took me and they arrested me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there a court case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No, there was no court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You mentioned a consumer boycott.  What was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> We were not supposed to buy in town as we were fighting for our rights.  It was when Comrade Goniwe and others died.  We, as the community, were in pain.  We did not allow people to go and buy in town, because of certain reasons.  We were supposed to buy only in the townships, but I was not involved in such things.  Even when I got injured I was just on my way to shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> This Gideon told you that he wanted to know about being a Comrade.  You went out to explain to him.  What were you going to explain to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> I wanted to ask him what he wanted to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How old were you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> I was 18 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Were you at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No, I was not at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What were you doing?  Were you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No, I was staying at home looking after livestock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Was there any organisation in the community or the youth organisation you belonged to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You say that it was a normal thing, at that time, for people at your age not to belong in an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> At that time I use to go out to look for my, out for the livestock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Let us now continue from where you said that you were arrested when you were laying a charge.  For how long did you stay there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> I stayed for 50 days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> When I was there, there was a police by the name of Matiwane Stemele.  He would come to our cell and beat us and assault us.  When I was about to be released he said that I am supposed to give them the guns that were in my home.  I told them I know nothing about the guns.  He told me that he will assault me, because I do know about these guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Do you know of any reason this policeman was</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>accusing you of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened after you were released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> I went home.  When I arrived at home I asked my mother where was my younger brother.  My mother told me that the police are looking for us and they are saying that there are petrol bombs and guns in my house and they were looking for them.  I told my mother we know nothing about the petrol bombs and the guns.  We did not know what the police wanted from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where was your younger brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> He was sleeping in the forest, because they were running away from home, because they were being assaulted by the police.  When I arrived at home I was not happy.  Every morning and every night the police would come.  We would not sleep.  They would come to my room, knock and kick the door.  When I asked them what they wanted, they said they would beat me up and say that they wanted these guns.  They would take me to the van and take us to prison, assault us and release us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Who were these people who assaulted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> It was Matiwane Stemele.</p>

I did not know why they were assaulting me, because I knew nothing.  I only looked for livestock.  I did not know what they wanted from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What about Rooibaard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> He was a policeman from Bedford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Where are they now?</p>

<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What happened after all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> I became sick, my ribs were broken.  The doctor took me to hospital and they transferred me to East London.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> What year was this?  Was it 1985 or 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> It was in 1986.  They took me to East London.  In East London the doctor said that I must stay in hospital to recover.  I stayed there in hospital.  I was sick and I was not well.  I was afraid of being assaulted.  I will tell the doctor that I am not okay so that he will not discharge me from hospital, because I was scared of being beaten up.  I stayed in hospital.  The doctor would come to me and ask me how I felt.  I will tell them, him that I am not well, because I was scared I did not want to go back home, because I would be assaulted by the police.  We were not happy at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> How long did you stay in hospital?</p>

<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> My request to the Commission is that police were harassing us and I cannot forgive them, because they were not supposed to treat us and it was against the Law to torture us and to treat us like that, because our lives were not safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> In other words, what are you saying to the police now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> What I am saying is that I cannot forgive them.  I would like them to, I would like new members to be placed in the police force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You said that you want the perpetrators to come forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> You also mentioned that you need disability grant in order to take care of your ten year old child.  Is that all you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> Yes, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS MAYA:</span> Thank you Mandlakayise.  I will hand over to the Chairperson.  Maybe there are questions you are going to be asked by my colleagues.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Mr Mphithi, I just have two questions for you.  The first one is, maybe, a difficult question, but, perhaps, you may answer it if you want to.  Were you ever approached by any State officials to assist them in their work against the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> No, I was not approached by any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS CRICHTON:</span> Alright and the second question is to ask you what is the situation in Bedford now?  You are saying that those who were part of assaulting you are actually still in Bedford, one of them is still in the police in Bedford.  What is the situation in the community now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPHITHI:</span> The situation in Bedford is not the same as before.  Things are better now.</p>

<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mandlakayise.  You have told us a painful story that happened in small towns.  People would be arrested like flies.  You have told us a painful story, but the way you present your story, you make us laugh.  We are laughing because you remember nothing, you were just looking after your livestock, but we can see that if we can sit down with you, there is a lot we can get from you that you have not revealed here today.  We thank you and we will try to find out the name of the hospital.  I know that you have mentioned that you do not remember the name.  I know that if you are coming from a small town and you go into a city, you become confused.  It might happen that you do not remember the name of the hospital, but it is important for us to know the hospital so that we can get a medical report.  We thank you, Mandlakayise.  You may step down.  Do not run away, we will come back to you.</p>
