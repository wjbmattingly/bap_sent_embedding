            "Thank you Mrs Gqamfane.  We thank you for coming here and testifying, telling us about your son.  It is clear that he was taking part in the community activities in Alicedale.  We noted that the person who killed him is in Port Elizabeth.  We would like to consult him to give us reasons why he killed your son.  We also noted your request to the Commission.\n I can say that I am very touched because you requested money in order to support the child, your son's child.  Many people think that they are coming here in front of the Commission people expect to be compensated, but the amount of money, which is R10 000 that you have put in your statement, as I am thinking that this R10 000 is not enough because it will not support your son's child.  You have requested this amount and this shows that you just want your son's child to be educated.  We will forward your request to the President of this country.\n We also noted that you asked the Commission to build a hospital to help people in Alicedale. This shows that you are a parent who does not think about herself only but who thinks about other people.  We thank you for setting this example.\n We would like you to take your seat and we will take a 30 minute break and we will come back again.\nCOMMISSION ADJOURNS",
