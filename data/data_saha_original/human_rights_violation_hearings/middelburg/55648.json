            "One man from Nelspruit came to my house and took my son together with him and my son never returned home.\n I heard on the 27th that my son was also, that my daughter was also killed in a bomb in Nelspruit.  However, the person accompanying never came back to tell, to relate the matter to me.\n I was told that there were seven inside the car and only five died.  Two of them survived;  the driver and the person who was sitting next to the driver.\n Up to today this person never came back to me to related the issue.  \n The father of the child went to the scene and he also discovered that it was true that the daughter was killed.  And he managed to identify the daughter.  And they asked him to produce his, the ID.  They verified that this was the body of the person on the ID.\n And further he also asked if he could personally identify his child.  And they said to him unfortunately he won't be able to recognise the child, because of the injuries that she suffered. \n They kept her at Nelspruit.  He didn't get the chance to identify her.  He went back the next day and they took him from office to office and later he happened to manage to identify the daughter.  \n He was cut into two pieces.  They asked him, what is he going to do with the body?  He asked them to give him the body, the corpse.  They said we can do that, but I mean, this corpse, when we know the person, is known as Masilela.  And you're telling us this is supposed to be Masilela.  All we know, that this one is from Gloukou and she doesn't have parents.\n It was necessary that she was supposed to be buried at Gloukou on Saturday.  And he asked us whether we have alternative, an alternative place to bury the deceased?  They said it will be best if they take the body to Belfast.\n We said we didn't have money.  I'm sick, I had come to (... indistinct).  Then they took his documents.  Then they said he should go and identify the coffin where they can put the corpse.  \n Then the Safas came from Nelspruit transported her to Belfast.  Then she requested that as a parent then you could be given the lift to Belfast to where the child was going to be buried.\n We did not know whether her father did find her or not, because it almost took us two days, took him two days to come back.  We tried to phone the hospital in Nelspruit, but they couldn't tell us.  \n They told us that he's not there.  We even phoned Safas (... indistinct) in Nelspruit.  They confirmed the child's father was there.  Then they called him to talk to us.  Then he confirmed that he found her.\n Then when he said, it was one who asked him that it is suspected that you bought the identification.  But he confirmed that no, that was his daughter's body.",
