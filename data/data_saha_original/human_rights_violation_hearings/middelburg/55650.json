            "It was in 1986, on the 4th of January, we were going to talk about the rent issue.  When we arrived outside the stadium, we stood outside waiting for the councillors.  They didn't arrive.\n However police did arrive at the scene and they asked us to what we're doing outside the stadium.  And we told them that we're supposed to have a meeting with the councils.  They told us that the councillors are not coming and we asked them, why aren't they coming, because they promised that the meeting will be today?  \n They said to us;  no, we're giving you five minutes to leave this place.  We told them, we're not moving, because we're coming to protest against the rent.  However, they started shooting and we started running.\n Many people were injured.  After warning we ran for some distance and we came to a stand.  Later some houses belonging to policemen were burned.  It was approximately two of them.  When the houses started burning, I decided to go back home.  When I arrived at home, I found that the house was locked and the next door neighbour told me that your mother has been shot - at the meeting.  \n Therefor I went to my (... indistinct).  It's not that far, because it is about one street from my place.  When I entered the home, she told me that my mother has been shot.  I left that place and ran back to the meeting place.  When I got out of that house, I heard some shots outside.  I looked back and I saw some police, some were not cleared in police uniform.\n Once seeing that, I discovered later that I was lying on the ground, I was shot.  I didn't know what happened.  I tried to stand, using my right-hand and I've realised that my left-foot had been shot and I have to sit down.\n The police arrived at the scene and they took my into a car and took me to the doctor.  When I arrived at the doctor's place, he wanted to give me an injection and I refused and I told him you've got to cut off the leg.  And he said, he can do that here if they take me to Middelburg and he took me to Middelburg.\n I stayed about two to three hours and later they sent me to Kempton Park.  Arriving at Kempton Park, I stayed there and they took me to theatre on that particular night.  When I woke up, I discovered that I was, my foot was bandaged.  I also found out that I was shot.\n When I arrived at ward 19, where I was staying, I discovered there was a policeman next to me.  I asked him as to what does he want.  He said, Jabu, you are Jabu from Sentetuki Belfast?  He said, I'm coming to guard you.\n I asked him, why are you guarding me?  He said, no, you burned the police houses.  I asked him, did you see me at those places burning the houses.  He said, no, I'm just coming here to do my job.  I have to guard you.  So I stayed at Kempton Park.   \n And on January (... indistinct), 16h00, I was discharged and I went back home.  At home, police came to my house.  They asked me to come to the police station.  I asked them, why do I have to come to the police station?  They just said, just come, we will tell you when you arrive.\n Then I went to the police station.  They opened a document and I was charged for burning police houses and I asked them, do you have a witness to testify as to this matter?  They said, you have to come to court.  \n At the very same time, they took me to the court and the case was reminded.  And fortunately the date which was given for the next hearing was on the same date we have to  go and see a doctor.\n I had to go back to court.  I was also charged together with some other comrades who were suspected of having burned the houses.  However later they separated the case and there was a specific charge on me.\n The court convicted me.  I asked them, why did they convict me?  They said, I was convicted for burning the houses of policemen.  They said the evidence indicated that I was involved in the burning of those houses.  And I was sentenced for five years suspended.  \n I was also on plaster and I had to serve that outside.",

If you don't do it, they use teargas, they use buckshot, they use rubber bullets and they disperse the crowd.  \n In principle that is what happened.  Now the difficulty that I have, having listened to you is that, that part you give us in exactly the same way as our experiences.  But you seem to feel that we may be sitting here as a court of law, wanting to accuse you again.  \n So we don't get in the same open fashion your story as to really what the activities of the youth were.  In your evidence you simply said that after you were dispersed and the people were running away, you say, two houses of policemen started to burn.\n Now frankly, houses don't start to burn by themselves.  People set fire to houses.  They commit arson in some way.  And this too, was a pattern in the struggle.  Can't you tell us more about that.  \n I mean, surely you were an active member of the youth league.  Was this a pattern?  Did the youth do it?  You don't have to tell us whether you participated or not.  \n But in some way you make, you create the impression as if you're saying it happens by itself.  And there were two sides or more sides to the conflict.  Won't you share a little of that with us?",

It was a all-out war generally speaking between the security police and the broader establishment and the youth.\n The youth carried the torture of liberation.  I'm not using a pun when I say the torch.  But the youth were really in the front line of everything.  And the security establishment, by all our research and evidence from other areas, were all out to stamp out the resistance.\n Now, is this impression correct, or is it totally untrue?
