            "In 1992 in December I had a stokvel at home and the Khumalo Gang members came.  I was inside the house selling and my brother who is dead now, was outside. Three boys came in,  Khumalo gangster members and one sat down right next to me and the two others went on inside the house searching for others.  Three minutes later one boy came in with an AK running after the Khumalo gangster members that were inside the house and left also.  One friend showed him that the person standing at the door is the one they were looking for. He shot at the guy who was a Khumalo member and the other two ran away and jumped the fence.\n They brought Khumalo who came himself in person and started shooting randomly around at everybody who was on the premises, shooting without even asking anyone what happened. The stability unit and the soldiers came and started assaulting and slapping people and did not listen when the people tried to express themselves.  We ran out of the house and I went to a friend's place and lay down on the lawn because I was tired and in pain.  \n They got inside and took the television set and money and my radio and liquor.  When the soldiers were still standing there a mortuary vehicle came to fetch all the corpses and there was one lady in a wheelchair and she was also affected.  She was with us in the house, she just died recently a few weeks ago.\n The 14th, the following day one policeman came and arrested my brother.  He didn't want the house and he kept saying that the house was a house of thugs and the lady who is here just now, Lucky is my friend.\n December 16th we heard some sort of party of some kind and there was one girl who called Khumalo and told Him where we were.  Fortunately we had already left the place and when he got there he found one boy whom he assaulted and shot him.\n The 17th of December I opened this Spaza shop and there was Tokoza taxi patrollers who were working hand in hand with Khumalo and they were shooting around. If they met any male they would shoot without asking any questions.  If you were a boy you were shot, no doubt about that.  If you had on a cap, no question, you would be shot. I tried to escape and I went to Sebokeng.  I came back on the 31st.  \n My friend and my brothers also had a party and they extended and invitation to me and I joined them where the party was taking place.  We had a good time drinking wine when at one o'clock said that I was leaving. We all decided to go and the five, Tapelo, Randy, Aaron, Pani and one other that I did not know of us, went in opposite directions to me and met the Khumalo gang on the way who shot them all dead.\n One day Khumalo came to my house with boers and they were driving a maroon husky and they took my entire album with them.  I left the place and went to a girl friend's place in Katlehong and Khumalo followed me there. Just when I left the house he came in and said he was looking for a short boy and another one who had a limp.  They did not find them because they had already left.  That disturbed me a great deal because I knew Khumalo as a reverend, a pastor so to speak.  Now that all these things were happening and he was the very one in the forefront it was a shock and a surprise to me. \n One day he came to my place before my brother was arrested and requested us to go and beat up Mugabe.  He was driving a combi that day and we joined him and when we got to Mugabe's house we found his mum and she told us that Mugabe had left the place and it's been quite some time.  We came back and suddenly the very man that we were rendering the favour to turned against us.  Today he calls us hooligans and all sorts of names.  When we put on a cap or a pair of jeans he calls us a name.\n When we go to some areas we are not free at all because follows us always armed and those weapons are probably not even licensed but they are however allowed to use them.  I will end there.",
