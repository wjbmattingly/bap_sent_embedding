            "Well, as I have already explained it was in 1985 and at that time the whole country was in turmoil and Duduza, in particular, had a problem.  It was part of the ongoing struggle at that time.  There were no police at that time who were in Duduza.  Even though the police were not present in Duduza at that time, there were certain forces operating during the night and these forces were mainly bent on killing the people operating.  Today we do not have Saneli Tobela and today we also do not have Alex Balene.  All those people were attacked by hit squad.  The Tobela home was attacked and Sonto Tobela was our Secretary at the time and Saneli was additional member of COSAS and, when their house was attacked Sonto died instantly.  Alexander Balene was murdered by that hit squad which was operating in the location.  To confirm that there was a hit squad, there was a City Press article which showed that more leaders were to follow in the killings.  They also had a list of names and some of the names which appeared then are present today and as it was still like that there was Congress Mashweni which was from Kwatema and through that Congress as well as through Valley, Valley is my cousin, he is sitting on my right-hand side, and that there were MK members who were actually prepared to offer us some\nassistance because we were vulnerable and he offered us help\nin terms of weapons.  So we wholeheartedly accepted, accepted his offer and that event co-incided with the statement from ANC in exile saying that it will now train ANC cadres inside the country and duty operation, we were prepared to liberate our country by all means necessary.  So through Valley who was the local co-ordinator, these guys came, Mike, James and they said they will offer us weapons to defend ourselves and the community.  They offered us crash training, crash course training whereby we were taken to a mine dump.  We were three groups, basically, that was Duduza, Sakane and Kwatema and we gave those people, Mike and James, our names and addresses.  \n We went there and they demonstrated with the first hand grenade and we were, he threw the first one to show us how to throw it as well as the second one which was thrown by Valley and at the very same time we were told that we should choose our targets, that was on a Monday, preparing for attack on Tuesday, midnight.  Each and every township had its group, from each township had to choose its own target and attack at 12 o' clock.  So we met as a group and chose, we chose Stiff Namane's house as well as David Namane who were brothers.  The reason we chose these two people were that Stiff Namane was a councillor, an apartheid councillor.  David was implicated in these hit squad attacks and his brother too.  So, basically, at the time the community saw them as people or as obstacles towards our achievement of our goal.  \n So, we met Mike and James on Tuesday, we were given these hand grenades.  Funny enough, those hand grenades were not similar to the ones that he showed us at training, but \nnevertheless they said they are all the same, the instructions are the same.  So, coming back at training, we were shown how to throw a grenade.  You hold a grenade, you count three times, you pull the pin is one, is two, then Maponza is three.  So, on Tuesday we went to our respective targets.  When we got there 12 midnight we launched an attack.  We followed the instructions correctly and Sonto, and all of us at that time, but when we counted at one, by that time, at that time I was lying flat on the floor and thereafter I realised that I was full of blood and I had to run to Sandile Conrad house and ask for help and at the time I thought I had made the mistake.  \n When I got to Sandile's car, I got John Emlangeni, same injuries.  Then we went to Natalspruit Hospital.  That is when the security forces caught us and we were detained and discharged, but during our stay at hospital our families came and told us some of the people were weak, have fallen and that, in itself, proved that sinister forces were involved because people from Kwatema, Sakane and Duduza, were involved in this case, died and the targets that were meant, our targets, are still alive.  So, we realised that this is the hit squad that we were trying to run away from.  So, these people, all I can say, they were highly organised.   So we were charged, we went to court, we went to prison and we were found guilty and there is not even a single person who came forward to explain and we were found guilty.",

They did not want us to get the new South Africa that we are in today and quite a number of them are happy today because they are enjoying the benefits and the privileges of a new South Africa.

            "I can point out that quite a number of things were covered up by Titus.   That is with regard to the incident itself as that is what we referred to as the zero hundred hour, that is from the media as well as through the confessions of Mamasela, but the picture that I want to paint before this Commission was the situation that prevailed at that time as well as the reason for the targeting of most of the people that got involved later on in the squads, that is in Duduza,  Sakane as well as Kwatema.  When this took place, as Titus had already explained, that it was between 1984 and 1985, the situation was such that we realised that the areas within the Vaal, there was an outbreak of boycotts and Duduza was not an exception at that time and the way Duduza took up the struggle in February 1985 was such that we were staging demonstrations against the bucket system.  The organisation that was prominent at that time was not the Civic Organisation.  The Civic Association of Duduza was being pushed by COSAS and this resulted in the fact that most of the civic leaders in Duduza were aligning themselves more with COSAS, because the structure itself had problems in functioning and in the boycott that was staged with regard to the bucket system, many people who took part were members of the COSAS.  That is in 1985 I was a Chairperson of the COSAS in Duduza and John Emlangeni was the Secretary, the Publicity Secretary of COSAS and Tokizane Lala was working as an Executive and Humphrey Tshabalala was involved in Entertainment Committee.\n We were actually employing different strategies in the \nCOSAS and some of the Comrades who were in Kwatema, that is \nComrade Congress was a Chairperson of the COSAS in Kwatema and he was coming back from the Sasol Organisation and ASASO which was working closely with COSAS and he was coming from the University of Zululand and he use to fill us in with regard to the struggle so that we could continue.  At that time the situation that prevailed was that Comrade Ngungun Yani, who also died in that incident, was also a former Chairperson of the COSAS.  Machodi was also an Executive member heading the Cultural Desk of COSAS and Comrade Osborn Lamini was one of the Comrades who were dealing with disciplinary measures against members.  \n What I am trying to highlight before this Commission is the calibre of the targets and Joe Mamasela thought that he could wipe the leadership of COSAS so that we could be left with a vacuum.  So, as the reign of terror was conducted it became well known as to who their targets were.  The situation after the bucket system was that a certain boy was shot and it was COSAS which was prominent in that area.  After that boy had been shot, that is Lucky Nkwinazi, thereafter there were certain incidents that took place that followed each other which led to Duduza being ungovernable and after Lucky Nkwinazi had been shot and just before a funeral could be arranged, more than 20 members of the COSAS group were arrested.  They were charged with public violence and following that myself and Comrade John as well as the other ones I am sitting with, we were detained under Section 50, that is the Internal Security Act.  We were told that we were furthering the aims of a banned organisation.  We stayed there for 14 days in detention.  Some of us were tortured, some were assaulted and some were injured and we \ndiscovered later on that what they were actually arresting us for was for mobilising the community towards a certain group.  \n Thereafter the white people realised that, let me just divert and go out of the issue, talk with regard to Titus's issue and the Tobela family.  Comrade Sonto Tobela was a Secretary for the COSAS group.  She was an additional member and Mr Tobela himself was our co-worker because apart from being a member, I was a student's committee member which was dealing mainly with regard to age restrictions with regard to admission of students at certain schools.  We were also fighting for the rights of SRC members.  These members were also detained under the Section 50 of Internal Security Act and when they were released and when Mr Tobela's house was attacked, that is when Sonto was killed and comrade Saneli.  This brought here in the community that these forces, that Titus had referred to as the forces of darkness, were not prepared to arrest people only.  They even wanted to move a whole mile so our lives were at stake at that time and we needed a mechanism in order to be able to defend ourselves as well as members of the community.  \n During April and May we started mobilising ourselves as the COSAS members to try and get a strategy in order to fend off the attacks as well as the rule of apartheid and we were also a Congress of Students and we were coming from different homes which were being effected by social problems like rent, so we could not divorce ourselves from what was happening within the community itself.  So, COSAS, apart from fighting for students rights, they moved beyond that and they focused on issues or social issues that prevailed within the community at that time.  When we realised that \nour members were now being killed we started getting scared and we wanted to devise some mechanisms to fend off the attacks and we later on got to know that we were in the hit list and we were supposed to be eliminated as the targets of the system.  We later decided that we had to fend off the attacks in some way, that is when Congress Mashweni approached me and explained to me that there were certain people who had already approached him with regard to fending off the attacks, but the people who came to approach him were told that they should come to me together with that person.  \n I would like that to be put through to this Commission that these people came saying they were members of the MK and they were instructed to go to Congress, because Congress was close to me and Congress had to come straight to me.  In 1985 there was a directive from the ANC in exile that certain units from the Umkhonto we Sizwe would not be trained outside the country, but they would be trained inside the country and so we realised that we were going to be the first group that was going to be trained within the country.  When Congress came with the people and having briefed me that these people were coming from the MK camps and they were fully trained and they were going to train us as well to be part of the Umkhonto we Sizwe which was going to be trained within the country to defend ourselves against the vigilantes so that we can hit where it has most and the Government or the system.\n At that time I did not want to question their behaviour or the manner in which the directive came because it actually co-incided with a statement that was made by the ANC earlier on, that they were going to train people within \nthe country and that is why I never actually bothered myself to ask many questions.  We welcomed these people as Comrades in Duduza and we said to them we were prepared that we should be trained in order to fend off the attacks from the vigilantes in order to protect the community.  That is what culminated to the incident that we are talking about today.  What Titus said just now is important that where we targeted, these houses were no longer occupied.  \n I want to be honest in one other aspect that in Duduza, as Titus has already mentioned, that at that time Duduza was the first area to be rendered ungovernable in the East Rand and Duduza was amongst the first, there were no police around, there was no one representing the situation, police or security officers within Duduza.  Probably, that is what actually caused Duduza to be rendered ungovernable because there were no Government officers within the area itself.",

These are the results of fighting for freedom and today we are all the same, we are all equal, but the question I want to bring forth to the Commission is that somehow this may come to forgiving and forgetting.  To be honest with the Commission is that what happened to us is  hard to forgive, it is hard to forget also.  For instance, as we sitting before this Commission there are some members of us who are not here and, all of us, we are maimed in some way and we can also point out that each and every one of us has a stigma attached.  For instance, people always act, refer to us as Valley, the who without a hand and Sipho, the one who has got missing fingers.  This leaves a picture that is always painted and that will never ever disappear.  It becomes very difficult for us.\n Maybe Mamasela represented certain forces that could not be shaken or removed, but I want to point it out that Mamasela made a mistake, you see.  The masses of the people like J Bona, if probably organised they can trample on to anything, that was the mistake that he made, but honestly speaking, forgiving and forgetting is very hard for us.",
