And I got up and they stood there as if they were chasing some kind of wild animal. \nThey couldn't speak to you in a civilized manner and they couldn't even knock properly.  We got up and they said that we were coming back the same night, so we left - we left for the charge office.  They never took any statements or anything from us.  When we got there, it was - there were more reservist than anything ells of farmers.  That same night we were taken through to Graaff-Reinet, when we got to Graaff-Reinet we just stayed there for a week and we a - we consulted a doctor, but I cannot even say it was  actually a doctor because he didn't even examine us or say anything.  He didn't say what was wrong with a person.  Thereafter we were taken to George, we were released from George in November and we weren't told what the reason for that was - we weren't given any kind of explanations so we just remained there. \n And I discovered there that I was six months pregnant and they were so surprised and wanted to know from me why I didn't tell them I was pregnant.  So I told them that's because I didn't know, I just saw my body growing and didn't even know I was six months pregnant.  And I said we - we see doctors here every day, what are they here, just for the eye blind or what is it, because they don't even - even examine you.
