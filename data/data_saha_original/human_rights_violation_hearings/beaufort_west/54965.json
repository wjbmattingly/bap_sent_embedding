And when I asked them what they were doing, who's permission did they have.  \nThen they told me they were policemen, I should not question them.  Then I kept quiet and at about 3 o'clock in the morning, I again asked them what they actually wanted.  Then they said that I should leave them.  I shouldn't just talk nonsense to them.

So I did go outside and I saw a police van outside and I was shoved into one of the vans.  \nThey drove away with me to the Police Station where we were separated and we were put into another van and we were put into various vans - in groups.  So in the Police Camp towards early morning, they took us to Beaufort West and they drove on to Oudtshoorn and in Oudtshoorn they again divided us into groups.  They sent me to Calitzdorp, together with another man and some other people I do not now.  In Calitzdorp - that is where we were for about 2 weeks and were being fed on porridge only. \nEver since I was taken from home, I was given porridge and it was very tough.  I even complained that we couldn't even get gravy because we're even having some heartburn from eating the porridge.  Then my colleagues they said that I should go and talk to this white policeman.  Then I asked him to call them to me.  So he said yes he would.\nThen at night we were offered soup and pap -  porridge  - and then they came for me,  so I left the others behind.  Then they moved me from Calitzdorp to Oudtshoorn and they asked me if I knew why I had been arrested.  Then I said I didn't know.  Then they said they had them - they had arrested me because of  [indistinct]  which is PAC wing.\nThen I said to them that I knew nothing about that thing.  Then they said that I was telling them nonsense, then I said I wasn't telling them any nonsense.  Then one white man that was standing in front of me said that I was telling them nonsense, I should tell them the truth.  Then I told them that that was the only truth I had.

            "There - let me start off by making a  - giving my story.  We used to help each other.  In 1968, on the 24th  - on a Wednesday - and it was four o'clock in the morning then I was putting one child on my lap.  This child was three years of age and I was trying to put a stove on because it was a very chilly day.\nIt happened that, whilst I was still trying to set this stove on,  I heard a knock  at the door - on the window - and my wife peeped threw the window and say that it was the police.  And they came in - they were dressed in heavy coats - and they said  Where is the owner of the house?  And then I responded that here I was.  Then they said to the other one  You should keep watch on me.  And then they were going into the bedroom.  One of them tried to pull out the shelve and he emptied the shelve and they started looking at the books that was in the sitting room and also in the bedroom.  And at the time, I was in the sitting room together with the children.  I had 5 children at that time.\nThen it happened with time that I asked what they actually wanted from me.  Then they said I would get the information once I get there.  Then my wife asked what is it that I will hear.  Then they said they were going to bring me back.  Then  they said that they are going to take me away - then I asked them there they taking me to.  And I asked them where exactly because I wanted my family to know where they were taking me to.\nThen my wife gave me a coat and an overall - those overall known as a Sampson - so I also put on my socks in a disorderly manner and I didn't know why they were arresting me because I - ever since I was born, I had never been arrested before.  And I had never quarreled with anyone in my whole life.  Then I kept on asking them why they where taking me and where they were taking me to.\nAnd I could see that they where very serious and I suspected that something was drastically wrong and I did not even think that it was a - connected with politics.  So we went away and outside I saw there where vans all over - in all the streets, even behind the hill there were many of these vans - police vans - and I just said to myself this was very serious.  So I went out.  They pushed me into the van.  I saw Mr Maroma inside the van - Mr Maroma - I found him in the van and asked why he was there.  And he could not tell.  So the vans drove away to - and these people who arresting us, were very happy and I could - I was suspicious that something was up their sleeves.\nBut I couldn't tell what it was.  So we drove away until  we got to the Police Station and I saw Mr William Makulani, Willey Manene, Frans Manene.  I also saw Sam Phula and many others.  I saw Willem - Willem Madoena and many others who's names I have forgotten.  There were many of them.\nBecause we came from a very small town, so there were many of us and we knew each other.  So they took us  and asked us to keep quiet. With - there were many of them - the yard here before the Police Station was just full of people.  Then there was an instruction that two of us should be taken and we should be divided into small groups and then the Police van drove towards Beaufort West.  And got to the Police Station and this white man who were - they were very happy, I could see.  And I kept on talking to myself, wondering that what was actually wrong, but I could not tell what it was.  And then the vans drove  away - some of us were dropped in Oudtshoorn - some were dropped in George - some were dropped in Calitzdorp and I was there in Calitzdorp for 3 weeks, eating porridge they had mixed with salt - a lot of salt - that was watery because I was angry, I would mistake it for sugar.\nAnd they intentionally mixed this porridge with salt and I kept on wondering what actually had we done because I could see this was something very serious.  Right, I was there in Calitzdorp and later Mr Makulani joined me and we shared a cell and I asked him where he was coming from, and then he said he came from Oudtshoorn - where he had been beaten up - and even blood came out of his ear, to an extend that he could not hear properly.   Then I asked him what was wrong.\nThen he said no they say we are members of the PAC - of the Poqo wing - then I was surprised.  There were other men who had been arrested with us and they had been taken and made State Witnesses against giving  evidence about us.  And before long Mr Makulani was removed from there and I was left with Mr Maroma.\nTwo days there after I was also taken to Mr Maroma and we were taken in a car and I had a hope that I was being taken back home because I  had left my wife behind.  Even if it's time to go on. My wife was pregnant - it was just before she was going to get her baby and this what was worrying me most.  So we were taken to Oudtshoorn with Mr Marona and there was a room there of this size.\nAnd there were many men inside - Baadjies was one of them and I asked them what they were coming for - they stated - and I asked them why  they were there and they said  that they were alleged that they had been - they were members of  Poqo.  Then I was called into this room and I saw Mr Nortje who said to me - addressed me Alwinus - and told me that I had been in a political meeting there - in Mr Josezhe's house.\nAnd I asked them since when had that been happening but they - Poqo had been happening in Victoria West.  Then he said it was three years but he had just come - but he knew everything.  So they gave an instruction that I should be taken away and be locked in.  They tried to beat me but I blocked.  So I was locked in back to the cell.  We were taken one by one.  \nAmongst us was Willie Manene and Frans Manene.  Then we were taken with George Digeni, Divey Jose, Michael Malala.  We where twenty three in number after they had selected some of us from the group.  Long before anything could happen, we were taken - we're then taken - to Victoria West.\nThere were 26 of us who were taken to Victoria West and were sent to the Magistrates office.  We were in a file - standing there in a file.  I was the twenty sixth in that queue.  I was standing at the back, so the others went in and I was there standing.  Then Sergeant Vosloo - of Security Branch in Oudtshoorn - asked me why I was standing there.  Then I said that I wasn't thinking of anything but except what they had arrested me for.  Then he asked me to get in.  Then they said our case had been revered to the High Court in Cape Town.  \nThat is where we are going to appear in Court, so we got into the van, where we found some children and some women who had come to see us and women were crying  - my wife was big at that time, but today she is very thin from suffering.\nBecause what happened really, made her very sore - her heart very sore.  So we were taken and transferred to - passed Beaufort West we were transferred to - Laingsburg and they said we were going to spend a night in Worcester in a jail called Dronkhel and in Worcester twenty six of us, with other men we found there, we were given accommodation to sleep.  Then the following morning I can point out the way we were handled where as I done nothing.  Then ...[intervention]",

It happened in 1968 up to now.  \nSo in Worcester we spent a night there and then in the morning Sentile Bavata together with a man dressed in white came and said - said - he was going to speak Afrikaans to me and ask me to open - and ask me to go in.\nThere was also an old man, Madgali, who was an old man - who was quite old, even, I would say the age of the bishop.  Then he went in - we asked him to go in - and this bewaarder  - then we thought we were going to keep him there in the room amongst us.  So early in the morning - the next morning - we were taken to Pollsmoor and there were twenty six of us at the time.  At the reception they wrote particulars about our age, about our marital status et cetera, taking all the details.\nAt about this time there was a sheet of paper with names like Thike, Willie Manene and we asked these bewaarders  what was all this about.  Then this Willie had evidence in this case and had he - his name appeared on this page.  Then they - the allegation was that we were going to be put in poison in the - in the dam and were going to disconnect the electricity.  Because on the side of Victoria East there is a hill and we as twenty six, as we were - we were - referred to as an army.  And they alleged that we were going to lay there and we were going to take over the whole town and that was not true.\nWe were there for two months and then in July lawyers came to see us - Mr Vallem, Mr Wayne Peffer, Zeckelwitch and Former Kellis.  There were four of them - two lawyers defending thirteen, two other lawyers thirteen of us.  So we gave statements and after that we were told that  on a certain day in August we were going to appear in Court.  Then it happens that in August we appear in Court - that was in Pollsmoor.  They used to take us from Pollsmoor to the Courts - to the Court - that was Wednesday to Friday.  Then weekends we would spend then in Pollsmoor and there it was slightly better.\nWe could read newspapers, we could write letters home.  I even wrote a letter to my family and tell them that I was healthy and my wife would respond to my letters to.  And she told me that we had got a baby - a baby boy.   My wife had - my wife had a baby two months old - born on the 6th of May 1968.",

Then I said no I didn't know that person.\nMralasi was right but Alfiuns was not the name, otherwise my name is Alwinus.  So I asked them to call  Alfiuns in my place otherwise I'm Alwinus.  So I took out my identity book and also a letter that came from home with the news that I had a baby boy and I took - gave it to them.  The judge looked at me and looked at my ID book and said you are Alfiuns.  Then there was an argument about this first name of Alfiuns.  Then he said this belonged to Mr Brunette, who was a prosecutor.\nI kept on saying they should call Alfiuns because I was Alwinus.  So Mr Brunette paged through his statements for quite a while.  It was even longer than five minutes and the lawyers were watching and other men were all watching.  And the judge then asked me if I knew Mr Jose - then I said I knew him.  I said yes I was calling him as Chawhe, in his clan name.\nThen he asked me what TV Jose meant.  Then I said it meant Thami Victor Jose - he asked about his name.  I said he's - was in Somerset East.  Then he asked - he said Mr Maruma had told him that I could repair a radio.  Those were the radios that had some wires.  And we used to do certain things to the radios, that was before the FM.  Then it happened that they could not get Alwinus so I was discharged.  Then at Pollsmoor I was given a ticket and I got onto the train and on the 1st of '69 I came to Victoria West -  that was the 1st of May 1969.\nAt home I found my house disorderly, my children were very thin, my wife - who had never worked before -  was working for Mr Van Britten who was a farm owner and I'm now telling you about how we used to suffer those days.  My wife was earning R4.00 monthly and during the day she would get a plate of mealie-meal, half bottle of paraffin - mind you.\nWe had five children and she had to feed this children with all this, because one of  my daughters was at High School and - but she had to leave because I was not there.  So when I got home, I saw the baby boy and I was looking at my baby and this baby was running away from me - crying - because he could not recognize me.  And it was really hurting to me, then he ultimately got used to me and he grew up such that today, as I'm speaking to you now, they are grown-up men.\nBishop knows my eldest son - he knows what he is today - he is a traffic cop today.

            "It was easy if they had charged me for politics  because I could have shown then the book.  One other I have omitted is - which I would like to explain here in this gathering is - that Thequewe Willie Manene was a member  of the  Methodist and he accused me, together with his brother and another brother of his.  I must tell you everything that I taught about him so that one could make a story  out of this.  Willie Manene - I hated him for five years, I even wanted to stab him to death - stab him because he had hurt me and he implicated me and said I was there in that meeting.  And he said I was - we were hiding.\nThere was a lamp that was hidden under a table and this is an indication that this was  a real lie.  Willie Manene - I saw him in King Williams Town in 1972 and I was with my children.  And my children were not succeeding at school, so I decided to send them to King William's Town because I was working then.\nI took them to King William's Town and that is where things went better for them, even in Somerset.  That is were I met Willie Manene who was working in a showroom where they sell cars.  And one of my children pointed him and said there he is.  So I asked for my knife, I opened it, I put it into my pocket, I went close to Willie Manene.  This is God's work because His works are wonderful.\nI had intentions to stab him.  I opened the door and I saw a white man who asked me whether I wanted a car.  Then I said no.  I had last seen Willie in  1968, in court.  At the time he was wiping the car and he saw  me as I was moving slowly towards him.  In fact a person who was guilty, will always spot you and you know this is the truth.\nSo I went in greeted him and I asked him how he was and I asked him to go out with me.  We went outside and he stood there and he had some difficulty to talk.  And I was surprised what was wrong with him and I looked at him and I could see there was real change in him.  He had gone through a lot of suffering - he had gone through a lot of suffering.  I could see, it showed on his face and I asked why are you like this.\nDo your people know that you are like this?  Then he said no.  I asked him about Frans Manene, Samuel Manene.  Then I asked him if I could see Samuel to give him some messages.  Then he said yes, he said he was suffering  from high blood pressure, he had pains on his hip and his son to was ill treating and beating him.  I could see he was finished, I then called my wife and even that one, who was born when I was detained.  I called all them  - all of them  - and I said Willie here are your children because we had the same clan  name.  So he greeted them.\nThen I said these are your children, you can see they are old.  Then he said  Are you still going on with this.  Then I said to my wife  Look at this person, how he looks like.  And I asked my wife to take out one pound and give it to this man so that he could buy food for himself.  And that was the last I saw of him.  He never went back to his house, he never went to see his family.  He went to hospital and that was the end of his life.  So when he asked me how I had come there, I said I had come in a car.  So I went there, I drove out the car and he was standing there.\nThis is the man who was trying to drown me and as I was driving, he saw the registration, CCR, and he lifted his hand, trying to wave.  And I also waved back, so I stopped - I kept on waving for a long time, hooting, and then I drove of to Mtansane. That was the last I saw of him, because  he died thereafter.  So, even the hatred I had just faded away.  So that's why I say God is there and God is with us - we are parents but things may not do - people may not do bad things to others because we've got children, we have got children who we are bringing up.\nSo today you have allowed me to say everything to you and everything that has been locked in within my heart now, you have allowed me to have a clean breast of - so I am not even embarrassed today.  You can go to my house, you will be surprised  because God is like  those old bottles of wine that used to be closed with a cork and if you were to fill in a bucket with water and then you take that cork and put it into that water, that water will not sink, it will float.

In 1968 my son was doing Sub B and he used to write on a slate with a pencil and so he went on with his studies until he got to Standard 6 and I could not pay for his fees.\nAnd then he decided to go to Cape Town to my nephew's who live in Langa.  Then I heard that he had got a job at - in Claremont so he went to work there in Claremont for a long time - he worked there.  And he was quiet - not writing any letters to us.  Then one day I decided to get onto the train and I got my son there and I asked him why he was so quiet and then he gave me a letter  where it was stated - it was a book where everything - his expenditures and income were written.\nThen I said to him  This does not work.  I actually want to see your bank book,  and he did show it to me and at that time he had saved R600.00.  Then I asked him what he was going to do with the money.  Then he said the following week he intended packing and going home and going back to school and he  [indistinct] did exactly that.  He brought the money with him and we decided to go and make a loan of money and we got R400-00.\nThose days it was not very expensive to pay in schools because we added this R400-00 to the R600-00 that he had, to make R1,000-00 and I asked him whether he wanted to go back to school.

And then there was another daughter of mine who also wanted to go to a school in Fort Beaufort - a certain school in Fort Beaufort she wanted to go to is Thubaleto High School, which is a  [indistinct] College thing.\nSo we decided to make this effort and we got the loan, I drove them to Fort Beaufort and they went into this school.  So that is where my son got his education.  He spent two years there and he said it was not good for him in Allies.  He wanted to go to the Cape College in Western Cape, so I agreed.  There was no problem with the books and so he transferred to the Western Cape  and he went on studying.\nWe were going up and down trying to collect money, trying to channel moneys to the various schools.  We were eating dry porridge with water and sugar, trying to save and keep them in school.  Then it happened in - one day we were invited to a graduation ceremony, and so went there by train and up to Beaufort West because there had been accident with the train.\nThen there was a bus.  We boarded the bus to Cape Town and went to another relative of ours.  We stayed there for the days and this particular morning we saw Joos sitting there.  I still have a clear picture and I can see him dressed in his regalia - academic regalia.  Today he has - he is studying his LL.B., he has studied his LL.B. and he is working in Aliwal North.

Because there are some people who always consider freedom as having just started in 1976 -  for getting what your input too.  What surprises is that most cases as you said you were not even active but you were just arrested for nothing.\nWe therefore thank that the judge talked in the manner in which Mary Burton explained to us and he decided to release you.  But let us all say - let us observe that freedom.  We had to pay a very big price for it and in most cases people think that all these things happen only in Soweto, in Cape Town, in Durban and they tend to forget that this is just all over, especially in those hidden places.\nThis Commission helps therefore to let us know that our people were really suffering all over - not only in Soweto or in Cape Town, but in all the places.  And we therefor  must thank you and lift up our caps and say the price that you paid makes us remember and not to forget that we should play about with  the freedom we have got.\nWe also thank that - we thank you that - God also touched your heart when you saw this man,  that you intended to kill and you also listened when God  said to you look at his condition.  And you had, as you mentioned.  All the people in here were quiet  at the  time because I think even God at that time was touching our souls and reminding us that there are many wounds that are within us.

We should not want to revenges ourselves, we should reconcile instead and we should except one another so that this land that went through all this, should be blessed by God and God should place us in a position where we shall be exemplary to Rwanda, to Burundi and we point back to our past.  And say to them, here we are today, united we are.  We therefor thank you so much,  I thank you.\nThank you, may God bless you too and keep you and take care of you -  even your families as well, because God says what can you do to men and he places you in a very wide place.  I thank you.  We are now going to take a break for lunch, let us all stand as the witnesses removes them from their places,  please.",
