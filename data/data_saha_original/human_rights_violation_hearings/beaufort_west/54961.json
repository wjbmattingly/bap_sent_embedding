            "First I'd like to read a statement from our research notes.\nVictoria West,  a small Karoo town almost on the south border of the Northern Cape Province was site of intense protest led by youths in early 1985.  Poor living conditions and high unemployment were characteristic of the town for example many people lived in \"Die Witblokke\", stable like structures housing entire families in one room with only a stable door and one small window.\nHygienic standards were extremely low - unhygienic bucket toilets being the main problem.  The township was overcrowded.  People could not leave because of influx control and pass laws.\nDie Noodkamp was an emergency scheme where people erected their own shacks on serviced sites.\nProtest was largely directed against the community council and municipal police.  Deep conflict at times escalating into violence developed between collaborators and activist culminating in the mid 1985.",

            "If I think back, I think it was 1985, it was August the 27th  it was on a Saturday.  The police were busy patrolling  on that particular day,  but they fired tear gas off on that particular day.  They shot into the air.  It wasn't a ANC or UDF's, they were  - not only them - but people were toi-toiing and my mother's name was called out -  Emily's name was called out.\n Now, after the police shot the tear gas - fired it - the gas covered the entire town.  And then they came to the house were my mother lived - a lot of them came there.  They came with lamp oil,  and petrol bombs.  And they came and they broke the windows, they burnt , they tried to burnt the house inside - people inside.\n I  came there to come and inspect what was going on.  I don't live to far from the house, but I was stopped by three people, I may call  their names if you would allow me\n Don Jaftha\n Bhoeto Yoyo\n Xhani,  Ellof.\n They came there and they covered by paraffin so I couldn't continue  and I had to run to the Police Station.  I wanted the police to come and see what these youngsters where up to.  And they where destroying  things.  They charged the house and threw stones as it.  People were inside hiding, so I went to the police and the police said sorry we can't do anything.  The people are to many.  They wanted  - friends then had to go and find other police to try and help and they tried to get into the house - they broke into the house - and threw  God's grace we could manage to get people out eventually.  And they could run away.\n The police managed in fact to calm things down up to the Sunday morning.  But Sunday people were still not very happy.  My mother was taken away  half a kilometer out of the town.  They've taken her to a camp where soldiers use to come and visit.  And were they stayed around.  And later on people said no my mother could come back.  The old lady can come back, nobody will fight with her.  That's what the youngsters said.\n So this all happened at 172 New Bright.  She came back the 4th  November,  it was on a Wednesday and they came to look for the old woman again.  Patrick came threw the window, opened the door and once again they threw petrol bombs at the house and her burned her, my mother, for the second time and this was more serious.  When we came to the hospital  I realized she was not going to make it.  The last words of her was she said that this time they have me, but they have not broken my spirit.  That's what she said.  She died on the Saturday the 7th.\n That is actually what I can remember and how I can explain it.",
