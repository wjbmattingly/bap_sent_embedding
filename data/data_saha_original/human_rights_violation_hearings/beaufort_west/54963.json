We were standing behind the house and he was standing there and I asked him whether the policemen had not come again, because they had come earlier on to look for him.\nThen he said no they had not come and he went into the house because he was cooking porridge in the house and there was - Simphiwe was standing next to him.  And I think he was 7 years old at the time, whilst standing there where I was there came two police van and two policemen came - four policemen came out of the vans.  They were Vermeulen, Moodey, Dan and De Villiers - they went into Tshaka's home and I was watching and Dan asked Tshaka in Xhosa why he had not come when they had actually called for him.  Then he asked why they had called for him, whilst sitting there watching I saw the door being closed. \n I ran round to come and stand just before the gate and I could see Simphiwe standing afar next to another yard and I could hear sounds of them beating him.  I could hear that they were beating him, then I screamed.  There were other people around but I couldn't tell who those people were.  We were crying and Vermeulen threw tear gas at us, I ran away to my house because my sister liked doing washing,  then there were two baths there outside and then I dipped my face into this bath of water.\nAnd I went back to where I was standing before, as I was standing I could see that the door was open and Tshaka was standing at the door. He was bleeding and there was blood running down his neck.  And he looked very tired, I again went round - there were other people who had joined me now and De Villiers was standing outside. Some two other policemen were remaining there and Vermeulen had been standing outside all the time.  Then I heard De Villiers in Afrikaans saying  Give way, let me shoot this pig.   And I heard this sound - it - the - the gun that he used was not the usual gun that has got a loud sound.  I then looked at Tshaka and he was staggering - staggering - staggering and he ultimately fell next to the door, facing downwards. \nWe screamed, crying and more and more people came to the scene. And I don't know who brought information to the school and Themba came and asked who had shot Tshaka.  I was still crying and then I pointed at the person who had shot Tshaka.  After that there never was happiness in the location.  Some other police vans came and an ambulance to came and they took out a stretcher and they took Tshaka onto the stretcher, but we could make out that he was dead.  Because when they left they had - his body was covered with a blanket. \nThen they left with his body and in the location there never was happiness after that.  Until he was buried, even after his funeral there was no happiness what so ever.  I pause.",

Then I decided not to go to school first, I've went to my father first and I told him that I was hungry - I had to eat before getting to school.\nSo my father tried to cook porridge for me and police came to him and they told him - they asked him why he would not come to them if they had asked him to come to them.  Then he said he was going to come to them but he was still cooking porridge.  Then the policemen who - would not except that - they felt that they have been calling him several times and then the policemen would not listen to his explanation. \n They forced him to leave what he was doing and go with them and he said he could not leave me hungry as I was, because I was going to school.  He had to prepare porridge and then they did not allow that he should continue.  They started touching him and my father took a fork and stabbed them with the fork and they punched at him.  Then the police went out of the house and I saw one white policeman, a Boer, taking out a gun and advancing for my father.

I would just like - before asking you anything else - if you - if there's anything else you want to say, to read to you something of what I - Research Department have told us about what was happening at the time.  \nIn 1984 the African Township of Beaufort West had a population of approximately 7,000 consisting of hundreds of chanteys and approximately 600 houses.  11 taps and 16 public toilets served the entire community.  On the 9th of December 1984 the black youth of Beaufort West called a mass meeting at which the  Zanokhanyo Youth Organisation - Zanokhanyo means come with  the light - was established.  And the driving force behind the Youth Organization was a dynamic organizer and dedicated political activist, Mandlenkosi Tshaka Kratshi.\nOn the 22nd of January, as we've heard,  Mr Kratshi who was also a member of the UDF in the Karoo, an executive member, was shot dead.  Following the shooting, residents  gathered at the local community hall to discuss the shooting.  Numerous community councillors  resigned\nAfter police used tear gas to disperse the crowd outside a hall that evening, an attempt was made to fire a bomb at policeman's home.  The house was gutted, but the policeman and his family were taken safely to a secret address.  Unconfirmed reports alleged that the home attacked belonged to  one of the policemen involved in the shooting of  Mr Kratshi.  \nOn Wednesday a second house was gutted and there was a total boycott of classes on the 23rd of January at the Lower Primary School in the township.\nAll political gatherings in the Magisterial District of Beaufort West were banned for that weekend in terms of the Internal Security Act.  The funeral was held on the 1st of February and went ahead in a  ceremony marked by discipline and restraint.  The UDF and apparently the entire black community of Beaufort West decided to comply with all the provisions of an order by a Magistrate which prohibited freedom songs, banners and speeches and effectively restricted the crowd to fewer that 300.  \nThe people decided to plan the ceremony as a peaceful one and the word went out that most would have to stay indoors.  This was said by the Rev Paul Oliver of the AME Church.  The service  was a very emotional one and the township of Beaufort West was renamed KwaMandlenkosi in memory of Mr Kratshi.\nYou are Mr Kratshi junior, is there anything else that you would like to add to what you've said to us already?",

Mr Mangaliso - Ms Mangaliso let me start with you and say it is not very frequent when a neighbour stands up even to scream to provide assistance for a neighbour.  You took a chance by screaming when the police were beating on your neighbour, Mr Kratshi.  I think that today you show your concern about asking for assistance for Simphiwe.  In fact what comes across is that you regard him as your own son.  \nTo Simphiwe I'd like to say when everybody else's child in South Africa was going to school, African children were dying in the streets on the way to school, on the way back from school.  In your case, Simphiwe, you lost your father, your roll model, your supporter and like most of the children who's parents perished in the struggle in South Africa, you were left without that close support. \nYou have stated yourself how this has affected you, we are unable to determine what tomorrow could have been for you.  Maybe today but we are hoping that tomorrow will be a little better for you.  I know you sound like you despair, I know it seems like since your father's death nobody cares and I know you think that your live is like a treadmill, may I say that you are only 17 and that this is a new South Africa and in my fantasy with  new opportunities.\nIt is not a disgrace to go back to school at the age of 17 even to go back to standard 6.  I think you should raise your horizons, you don't have a father yes, but you have the support of the greater South African community.  I think you need to look to South Africa - your great community to provide you with assistance so that you can realize your dreams.  I personally would like to say we're going to explore possibilities for counseling for you so that we can rid you from that despair.  \nI know you're wondering and saying why me, why did I loose my father, there are thousands of children like you in South Africa who lost their fathers and their mothers.  If I can just give you a little bit of hope and say that we are going to carry forward this recommendations and be a part of your live from today.  And see if we could touch you just that little bit to make a difference, thank you very much.",

            "Thank you, you can leave the stage now.\nThat brings us to the end of the cases that we are to hear today and in Beaufort West.  We have heard in these past two days  many accounts of pain, of ongoing suffering and indeed sometimes of much anger.  We've heard of the long term effects on people's lives and on those of their families.  Lives disrupted, families damaged, children's futures blighted and employment denied to people, sometimes on suspicion that they were politically involved.      \nYes, we live in a new and changed society and there are new rolls for people - we think of Mr Lolwana and his roll now as a Deputy Mayor, but we've seen that there are old wounds with barely healed scares.\nWe heard the stories of elderly men, who after more that 20 years still carry the mental and physical damage that they suffered.  And we have heard of ongoing conflict in some places where people somehow have managed to go on living together even after dreadful experiences.  But true reconciliation seems far out of reach. \nWe've heard  much anger directed at members of the police and it must be very difficult for members of the SAPS, especially those who are working here to protect us in this hall, to listen to all of this.  It's difficult too for people who have suffered to see those who caused them suffering in all the time that we have heard from in these last two days, seeing those people who hurt them continue to occupy position of responsibility.\nNow I think I'm right in saying that all of the stories we have heard stem from - except for the - the member from Victoria West, who told us about events there in the 60's - the other cases all come from the period of the State of Emergency. And it was very interesting to me to see that some people were detained on the 12th of June of 1986.  If I remember correctly that was the date of the proclamation of the National State of Emergency.  So one has the sense that there was a feeling that now with the provisions of the State of Emergency it is possible to act against people no longer abiding by the term of the rule of law.\nAnd perhaps that's one of the lessons that we have to learn that we never again want a situation where people can act with impunity and have people in their power because that leads to dreadful deeds.  We have somehow to try and understand even then how and why things happened.  I think that the - the policemen who was found to have shot Mr Kratshi was 23 years old at the time.  What happened to young people to make them behave like that, how can we understand what was in the minds and hearts of people who were so fearful of the resistance ranged against us - against them, that they acted in that way.\nI believe that part of our task as Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to help us all so to try and understand one another that we can get over the deep gulfs. ...END OF TAPE 4, SIDE B...",
