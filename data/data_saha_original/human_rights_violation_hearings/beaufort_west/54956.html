<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>Yes, that was his name Geoffrey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>Geoffrey Vumazonke  [indistinct] </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>MS VUMAZONKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>Okay, could you start with your story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MS VUMAZONKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>In 1985, on the 22nd of August - on a Thursday - my sister had gone to a prayer meeting and her name was Olga and half past five she came back from the prayer meeting.  She went into the bedroom to undress, her last borne came in by the name Nobolelo to tell her that the Comrades were going to come and they were burning where they were.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>So we ignored this information and my sister said we should play a game Ludo and we should ignore what this child is saying.  Whilst we were ready to play the game - we just heard throw - stones being thrown all over the house, breaking windows, breaking doors. </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>Then my sister instructed me to take her three year old and run with her down the passage to the bedroom.  I was with the one who died, we hid there in the bedroom and there was this stone throwing for a long time and we couldn't see what was happening in front because we were hiding in the bedroom at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>Then there was this stone throwing, then police come said we should hide under the bed and I said no I was big.  And these beds were not lifted, so she decided to hide under the bed.  I also tried to hide under the bed - just the head could get under the bed.  Then there was this throwing of stones, then we heard a loud sound as if it was an explosion of gas.  Then I asked whether he had heard anything which was like fire, then he said he had heard.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>We were there in the bedroom, we couldn't see what was happening because we're in the bedroom.  And we were there for a time until it was late, it was after sunset when we went out.    And we couldn't see my sister - we were the only people in the house.  In the passage we saw some fire, then the front door was broken then the door was locked.  Then we had to squeeze ourselves  within the gaps there in the door.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>And that was me and Paulus and the three year old.  We went out, Paulus went to his home so I went to Diamond's family together with this child.  And we were there for a while, then I asked grandmother Nowhen that I wanted to go and look for my sister because when we went out she was not there. </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a> So I went to the house and I found my sister sitting on the dustbin and we talked to each other and she asked me how I had come out of the house.  Then I said I came out of the house when it was quite and then she said she was worried about us because she went and she went to the police because she was worried about me and the child.   Because the house was burning and she thought we were inside. </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a> So we didn't mind about the house and she explained to me and I asked for Katriena and she said Katriena had burnt.  At he time these children threw the gas through the window into the house - that is how she got burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>Ms  Vumazonke  the person you referred to in your statement as Katriena.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>MS VUMAZONKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>Yes, it is Katriena and so my sister said one person came into the house - that was Sabtidade and he had a brick that he threw at me but it did not hit me because I bent. Then I got a chance to get out through the window and ran away to ask - to bring the fire brigade. I really don't know who he was because I've just come, I don't know people here.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>So in the morning - on Friday - I woke up at the Diamond's place and went to the house. I could see the passage was burnt, the ceiling was burnt, the lounge - there was a sound system - that was burnt, there was a seat that was burnt.  The TV was damaged, a small table there was missing - we didn't know whether it was burnt and even in the kitchen some burning had taken place.  There was also a pipe that was burnt, then there were five bottles there, but they had not exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>Then on Friday he took us away and I asked them where they were going to sleep and they - he said they were going to sleep in the house, they were not going to run away because of these children.  So he took us to Rustdene at Sistoyzee with and we spent one month there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a> [indistinct] recognized the person who threw a brick?</p>

<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MS VUMAZONKE</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>Yes, then my sister said that an - that her boy was arrested then he was - he appeared in Court in Oudtshoorn and he was sentenced for five years and that was the only person he recognized within the group.  But what I know is that, that's the only thing I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>DR RAMASHALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>We've heard a number of stories about the burning of councilors houses...[intervention]</p>

<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>They said Geofrey Vumazonke was a counselor and he had - he had stopped being a counselor long ago, so when they were singing they were singing that he was an informer.</p>
