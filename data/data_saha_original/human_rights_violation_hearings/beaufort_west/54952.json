Sidney, we thank you for your presents here and we thank you - we thank you for coming to talk here and we sympathize with you and we also feel for you whiles walking down the street you had to be shot.  \nWe are going to try and hear from your lawyers as to - as to what happened to the - balance of the money.  As I said earlier, that - there are many who have suffered but what can give hope is that what they suffered for they have gained for it, because here we are now we have gained freedom that we have been wishing for.  So you also have a contribution into this freedom through the pain you have suffered.  \nWe all wish therefore that you could have seen all the beautiful things that happened like the inauguration of Mr Mandela as the president, but unfortunately you couldn't see all that because your eyes were removed.  But though you don't express it, but in you heart you still know that he is president and you even say you have also made a contribution with your eyes until we are here in this level.  \nI now hear you saying you can never work again, but there are many people who are blind but learn a lot.  Now don't you want to try and learn something because I know of those who're telephonist, et cetera and many other things.",
