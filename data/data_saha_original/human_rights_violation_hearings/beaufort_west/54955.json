            "Yes, one the 11th of the 7th month 1987 my wife and I where on our way to the location.  I was taking my brother's gas stove back to him, which I had borrowed and my wife and I met up with five of these kitskonstabels and they wanted to know what was in this bag which I was carrying.\nAnd I told them that it was a gas stove which I was returning to my brother - one which I had borrowed from him.   My wife was slightly upset and they started assaulting her and told me to leave.  I left her behind and went as far as my mother's house at 377 in the old location and I left the gas stove there.  And proceeded  on my way to a client who's hair I had to cut.\nAt this house on the corner, I found that they were busy beating this man's son - he was uncle Voorslag - and while we're watching, one of the constables, by the name of Vujani, wanted to know what I was doing there.\nAnd I said  \nNo I'm just watching what you people are doing And I'm busy cutting people's hair.\nHe started assaulting me.  And I put my hand in my back pocket and took out the seizures which I used to cut hair and showed them to him.  But he continued beating me, but I said    \nBut you can see these seizures.\nHe stood back and I ran a slight distance and I stopped and said  \nLook but you can't take the law into your own hands.  Take me to the police station - lay a charge against me - so that I can see which affiance I've committed.\nAnd I heard a voice saying  \nShoot him, he is clever.  \nBut I did not pay any attention to that and said to Vujani   \nCome take me to the police station.  \nAnd I just heard a shot -  I then fell.  I had to push my intestines back into my body and somebody came with a blanket and threw it over my body and some more of these kitskonstabels came and one of them said  \nLeave this dog, let him die.  \nAnd I nearly did die and said not one of them must go to him.  Another person, well know in the black area, went to call Phasi and Phasi came and said to these ten kitskonstabels  \nYou can shoot me as well, but I'm not going to allow this man to die in front of me.\nThere after the police van came followed by the ambulance.  I then lost consciousness and came too in Tygerberg hospital approximately a month later.  I did not know anything that was going on around me.  I didn't even remember anything about myself.  Upon my discharge from hospital, a Warrant Officer Marks came to the hospital and said to me, yes, we do not play, we just shoot you people.  \nI didn't answer him.\nDuring the month of December he came to my house and wanted to know if I was going  to lay  a charge and I said  Yes, because I hadn't done anything.  \nHe then said that I should sign a letter. I signed it in my room and he said that he was going to send a  investigating officer to me to investigate the matter further.  Since December 1987 I haven't heard anything.",
