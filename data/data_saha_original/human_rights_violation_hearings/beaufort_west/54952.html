<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>Bietjie voorentoe, skuif voorentoe.  Okay, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>Adv Denzil Potgieter is going to assist you to tell us your story.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>Thank you, Mary.  Mr Yabo, can you understand me when I speak Afrikaans.  I hear you - you made the oath in Afrikaans, so I'll speak Afrikaans to you.  I'll facilitate your evidence and this - in the story you are going to tell.  And I would also just, once again, like to say - like Mary Burton said to you - I would like to reiterate the welcome that she expressed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>Your story takes us back to the situation in Beaufort West, during a short period of a few months, when kitskonstabels were working here in the residential areas.  And earlier this morning we received a background picture from Joyce Seroke about  the situation in Beaufort West at the time where kitskonstabels were patrolling the areas, and your story is once again going to take us back to those incidence.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>You, in fact, were the first victim of five - first of five  victims which Joyce Seroke referred to who were either killed or seriously  injured during the  reign of the - of terror of the kitskonstabels, so we are going to listen to your evidence now, which is about a shooting incident on the 20th of June 1987.  So I would like to begin by asking you to explain to us what happened on the 20th of June 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>Can I start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>You may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>We came from  a nightclub and were on our way home - it was approximately </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>9 o'clock that evening.  On my way I heard a shot and started running.  I was  [indistinct]  - taken to the hospital at Beaufort West - I was in Cape Town for 3 weeks and they came to fetch me in a police van and locked me up for two days, at the Police Station.   Then they came to fetch me and I was released on free bail.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>The trial  continued for approximately a year and there were allegations that I had burnt someone's house  and then the case was finalizes on the 17th of May 1988.  A claim was instituted - I'm not sure what the amount was - and the attorney representing me gave me R12,500-00 but I haven't received anything beyond that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>The interpreters found that - unfortunate a bit difficult to hear.  If - if the Commissioners could assist the victim.    We've missed that last answer from the person.  I'm going to ask - I'm  going to ask you to perhaps - with Paul's help - just move a little bit closer to the mike because people in the hall might battle to hear but also the interpreters so that - that might have a problem to interpret, so maybe can you  just sit a little bit closer.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>I'm going to ask a few questions to you so that we can get this story complete from you.  You say that it was on the 20th of June 1987, at approximately  9:00 p.m. the evening, when this shooting incident  took place.  Is that correct?       </p>

<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>So I accept that you'd like the Commission to investigate the matter regarding the money that is due to you, so that we can find out from the attorneys what happened to that money?  I except that you have need for the money.  You're not working at this moment, is that true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>Yes, I'm not working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>And in fact you can't work again in life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>No, I can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>Is there anything else that you'd like to ask from the Commission, or that  you'd like to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>Is that all you've wanted to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>ADV POTGIETER</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>Okay, thank you Mr Yabo. Thank you, any questions from the Commissioners, Mary Burton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>MS BURTON</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>Mr Yabo, I would like to know whether you're receiving a disability grant? </p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>Any other?  Sidney, we thank you for your presents here and we thank you - we thank you for coming to talk here and we sympathize with you and we also feel for you whiles walking down the street you had to be shot.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>We are going to try and hear from your lawyers as to - as to what happened to the - balance of the money.  As I said earlier, that - there are many who have suffered but what can give hope is that what they suffered for they have gained for it, because here we are now we have gained freedom that we have been wishing for.  So you also have a contribution into this freedom through the pain you have suffered.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>We all wish therefore that you could have seen all the beautiful things that happened like the inauguration of Mr Mandela as the president, but unfortunately you couldn't see all that because your eyes were removed.  But though you don't express it, but in you heart you still know that he is president and you even say you have also made a contribution with your eyes until we are here in this level.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>I now hear you saying you can never work again, but there are many people who are blind but learn a lot.  Now don't you want to try and learn something because I know of those who're telephonist, et cetera and many other things.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>What do you say? I say I didn't hear your answer and because you said you were no longer going to be able to work.  Now I'm saying there are many blind people - even in our office in Cape Town we have our - a telephonist who is like you - he is blind to - therefore I'm asking you whether you do not have any wishes to do some studies, so that you can be able to work for yourselves - self.  Okay, you'll think - you'll think about this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>I must remind you about people like Stevie Wonder - perhaps you can also sing, don't - can't you play a guitar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>MR YABO</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>No, I can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>Okay, we therefor thank you, Sir.       </p>
