They got out of two bakkies and we ran away.  I went into the yard of Katrina Seekoei's house.  Constable Flemming came to me and said ja gooi - gooi and pointed his rifle at me.  My arm was in cast and I was holding it up so he must have thought I was going to throw something at him.  Gooi, dan skiet ek, he said and shot me with bird shot.  One  of it is still in my right elbow, I then ran away.\n My husband went to ask why they shot me.  They, the police said it was because I stormed their bakkie with stones.  Flemming also said sy moet bly wees sy is nie vrek nie.  They left and came back later that day.\n Mothelesi took me to the doctors in Postmasburg and Olifantshoek but both refused to treat me.  We then went to Dr Cronje in Kathu who helped me.\n A week later Mothelesi took us to a doctor in Galeshewe, I cannot remember who.  He filled out forms and we had to take it to the Olifantshoek police station.  Nothing ever came of it.",

            "The victim alleges that on the 16th of June 1993 she and various others were toi-toiing in the streets of Ditloung that the crowds were only toi-toiing and marching in commemoration of the 1976 uprisings.  At approximately 1000 am the police arrived and according to the witness they got out of their bakkies and told them that the toi-toiing and the marching was illegal.  On receiving instructions to disperse she ran into the yard of Katrina Seekoei.  She was followed by Constable Flemming who came up to her and pointed his shotgun at her and said the following words - as jy gooi dan gaan ek jou skiet and without any reason shot the complainant with his shotgun.\n The complainant was shot in her elbow as well as behind her neck.  The leader of the ANC Mr David Mothelesi went to confront Constable Flemming and questioned him why he had shot the complainant.  According to the witness Flemming said the following words, she was lucky that she has not been killed - and he admitted shooting her.\n According to the complainant and the witness there were no incidents of any stone-throwing and it was totally unnecessary for the police or for Constable Flemming to use any means of force or shooting to subdue or disperse the crowd as the crowd had already dispersed on their instructions.  A while later the police returned to the complainant's house and Constable Flemming requested the complainant to go with him to receive medical treatment.  The complainant refused.\n The complainant was taken by David the witness to a hospital in Postmasburg as well as Olifantshoek where she was refused medical treatment.  Complainant was then taken to Dr Cronje in Kathu which is approximately 45 - 50 kilometres away from where the complainant resides and there she received treatment from Dr Cronje.\n According to the complainant a case was filed at the Olifantshoek police station but they never ever heard anything of the case.  According to the complainant many other people were shot on that particular day and also received treatment from Dr Cronje.  \nComplainant's other witness Beker Mompie was also shot on that particular day and had since died.\nDr Cronje was visited in Kathu and can recall that he attended to many people from the surrounding areas as he was the only doctor willing to help them.  According to Dr Cronje he  was ostracised by the society for more than two and a half years and had to struggle to make a living as a doctor in the Kathu area.  Dr Cronje will see if he can find any of the medical records of the patients he has attended to during the periods of unrest in the Postmasburg, Olifantshoek and Kathu areas and will forward it to the TRC's offices in Cape Town.\nAlso available will be Kabelo Bosiame.  He will also testify that during the unrest in June he was shot by the police while just walking to his residence and that he was also treated by Dr Cronje and he also lodged a complaint with the police at Olifantshoek but up till today nothing has ever transpired of the case that was made.\nVuizwa Moleleki as well as Mr Bosiame would like the TRC to investigate that matters further and to see that justice is done and that their cases which they made receive the necessary attention and that the alleged perpetrators be brought to book.",
