I'd be grateful if you would - first of all can you hear me all right on the earphones,  you can - you can hear the Xhosa,  right thank you very much indeed.  \nI'm going to ask you please to identify yourselves because there're quite a few of you here which is unusual.  So perhaps if you wouldn't mind my just calling out you names and you can tell me if that is who you are\nSylvia Mabija - thank you very much.\nShirley Mabija - thank you.\nThembi Mabija - Thembi is not here?\nAnd Henrietta Manzana - thank you very much indeed.\n Now we are going to be discussing and looking at - and hearing stories about Phakamile Mabija.   Before I ask you to tell that story which goes back to 20 - almost 20 years ago now,  I'm going to ask you to take the oath which we have to ask all witnesses.\nNow the way we're going to do that is the following, I'm going to ask you a question and I'm going to ask you - it together and if you are able to answer  that question your response is   So help me God.

Now I'm going to ask if you'll please put that light off on that - fine and only put it on when the person is speaking, it helps with the communication.  \nYou are the very first witnesses and I'm quite sure that you are nerves.  If you were not nerves you should be nerves.  You have a story to tell it  happened a very long time ago,  it will bring back many memories and you will  feel a great deal of pain.  Because those memories are very sad ones and one which caused you great misery a long time ago and you will be looking again to what happened.  \n And I want you to feel very relaxed - you are amongst friends.  For the first time perhaps in your life you have an opportunity to talk to an official Commission appointed by the President of the country and to tell us - to tell this audience and to tell South Africa and indeed the world what happened and what is in your hearts.\nI'm going to ask you to be quite brief but at the same time it is your story and we want you to tell it in your own way.  From time to time we'll be asking different Commissioners to assist in the telling of those stories but nothing more than that.  On this occasion I will be doing that on your behalf.  And first I'm going to call Sylvia Mabija and I would like you to tell us perhaps something about the Mabija family and then tell us what happened on that day on the 7th of June in 1977 concerning your brother.",

So they came in with Phaki and Phaki was dry and looked terrible  as a result of being beaten up by the police.  So this police the lifted up the carpet and after that they went into the bedroom and they searched.  I didn't see them coming out with anything and then after that they went outside with him at the gate.  And then as they were going out by the gate they then turned back into the house again and they said him \"gaan groet jou mense want jy sal nie vir hulle weer sien nie.\"  So  we were surprised and shocked about this statement but anyway we sat down and talked among ourselves.  It was not long afterwards then I just took my cousin half way as she was leaving because she was with us and we just heard while we were on our way that Phakamile is dead.  When I heard that it was a horrible thing to hear and it even became difficult for me to hear this and this was the most painful experience and I don't  even know how I got home.",

Phaki was sleeping in the front room with his brother Themba so when he woke up we opened the door and they said they were policemen they came in when they were inside they wanted Phaki and he showed himself.

            "On 27th June 1977 the police arrived at my home to search.  There were lots of them who came with SAP cars.  They told us that they were looking for Phakamile [Phaki].  At the time Phaki was asleep on the couch with his younger brother.  The police then left with him.  My other brothers had tried to visit him at the police cells at the Transvaal Road Police Station but in vain.  After some days, the 13th day of his arrest, two policemen came with Phakamile to our house.\n It was about 1400 when two of the policemen came home with him.  The two policemen were Oscar Ntsiko [deceased] and Van Wyk.  We could see that Phaki was in pain as he did not even want to speak to us.  The police led him to a carpet in the front room where they lifted it but there was nothing there.  He was later led out into the yard.  We tried to speak to him but he did not answer.  \nWhen they were about to leave the gate Van Wyk told Phaki to greet his people as he would not be able to see us again.  Van Wyk came in with him but he did not say a word.  They then left.\n After about 45 minutes we heard that Phaki had committed suicide.  This was unlike him as he had a strong character and he was also the community builder.  As a result of this incident his  father had suffered from a heart attack which had resulted in his death in 1983.  His mother had been affected by her son's death to such an extend that she is an invalid.  An inquest was held but nothing come out of it.\nSTATEMENT COMPLAINANT  -",

Colonel JD du Plessis, then Chief of the Kimberley Security Police, explained at the inquest that normally all windows are locked.  On that particular day he and a Mr Van der Merwe had opened a window in Van der Merwe's office to allow fresh air in.  Sergeant Oscar Ntsiko explained that he escorted the detainee from the toilet, when Mabija suddenly broke loose and ran into Van der Merwe's office.  He rushed after him, only to see the detainee crash through the window.   Du Plessis and Van der Merwe were in the office at the time.  The Head of the Security Police in the Northern Cape read from an alleged ANC pamphlet that urged detainees to commit suicide.  Lieutenant CHE van Wyk told the Court that he had instructed Sergeant Ntsiko and Constable MG Matsheka to take Mr Mabija home to fetch a document.\n The deceased's mother Dora Mabija told the inquest court that during his detention her son was taken back home to look for a document.  When this was not found a white detective had said to her son, say goodbye to your family, you will not see them again, Colonel Du Plessis disputed this statement.\n The district surgeon Dr TC Robertson identified a fractured skull as a cause of death.  In addition the independent pathologist, Dr BA Mahler, said Mabija had cuts on his face, hands and liver.  The cuts on his hands could have been caused by  clutching glass.
