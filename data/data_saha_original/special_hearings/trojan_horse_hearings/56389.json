Many people have come to your house immediately after the event and several years after that people repeatedly have come to you, your house has been captured on television and in the media and the press, pictures of the shooting and so on. But today we would like to give you the chance to tell us in your own words and to this commission how you experienced that event. I know it's a very difficult time for you today, to witness people dying in your house is not very easy. So we will give you the time to tell it in your own words, you can take your time and you can speak in the language that you feel most comfortable to do.",

            "On the 15th October 1985, that day I will never forget. On that day there was a march happening and I could see that things would go wrong, and the caspers and the police vans started driving up and down the\nroads. When the children were on their way to the muslim school, Ms Abrahams took their children to a muslim school, and Ms Abrahams returned from muslim school, I could see that something was going wrong. I invited them into the house and I closed the door of the house. One of the friends on my children did not want, wanted to go home, but I told him not to go home, that he had to stay with me for a while because of the obvious danger outside.\n He insisted and I opened the door of the house, as I opened the door of the house and just after the children went out they ran back into the house. I waited until all the children were back into the house and then I locked the door. Then I noted that one of my children and one of my sister's children were still outside and I panicked. I was also shot but was so concerned about my children and because Ms Abrahams was screaming. She said to me \"Please help me Zainab, please help me\" and I said to her \"I can't help you\" and then I went out at the back door of the house. I saw my children's son, I opened the back door and the child came in. Then I was still missing my child. Then I noticed my child was sitting in the chicken coup and the police were walking up and down in the passage way behind the house. \n My one child choked the chickens so that they would not make a noise because of the police walking up and down with their rifles and so that they would not notice him, he choked the chickens so that they died so that they would not make a noise and attract the attention of the police. He then came in. Ms Abrahams was still screaming and then my mother came and said to Ms Abrahams to stop screaming.\n Then this one fat policeman kicked open the door. My sister then said to him \" Don't kick open the door there are children in the house.\" When he kicked the door of the house open, I was convinced that he would kill all of us, because he came into the house with his rifle. One child was under the dressing table and the policeman grabbed him and then I screamed at my sister \" Look they are taking Ismail.\" Then we said to him the child is too small, leave the child. I then went to the kitchen and saw blood all over the kitchen. My food on my stove, and all of the cups and saucers and glasses in the kitchen were broken with the shots that were fired. I was then taken away.\n Then  when I returned home, my two girls were brought to me and the one boy had left and the other was still in the house. I was very ill after that. When I came home there were many, many people in the house, I did not know where to look and there were policemen who came to my house everyday, I think his surname was Steyn. He would come with a typewriter to my house everyday, insisting that I give him evidence. Whenever I get home from work, he would be at my house and then I said to him, \"I can't take this anymore.\" The social worker then came to me. I was ill subsequently and she took me away to a psychiatrist, I don't know where else they took me. I was at the hospital with the nurses and I was given medication to help me with my nerves. From the morning when I got up until the evening, I would see policemen everywhere. It would be something happening everyday for that whole week. \n In the evenings I had great difficulty going to sleep. My husband asked me what was wrong and I said to him I feel ill, my nerves are, cannot cope with the situation. When Shaun ran into the house, he threw himself on my bed. Ms Abrahams threw herself on the bed also and she had blood on her from the children. The children were wearing maroon jerseys so she did not see the blood. When he fell on my bed, he died and he died there on my bed.\n As the one policeman kicked open the door, he grabbed Shaun. I had a little step at my door and he grabbed the child's leg, the head in such a way that when he pulled up the child's head he then said \" The pig has died.\" He then put the child on the stretcher, and took the child with, away with the stretcher. Whenever I saw policemen or police vans, I could not cope with that. I still cannot deal with seeing policemen and police vans.\n Then the social worker came to my house and took me away to some or other place. It was a psychiatrist or something, I don't know where that was and they took care of me there. At night I cannot fall asleep and I then said to him - I don't want to sleep on this bed. This bed is covered in blood, as the children were lying on the bed and that affected my nerves very much. I will never be able to forget what happened that day. I had become almost like a child, I could not cope with loud noises. I was convinced that they would come back and shoot there.\n When they drive past my house, they look at my house. My house was exactly on the road, you could see right down to St Simons Road from my room. And you could stand anywhere in the road and see what was happening in my house. When the social worker came and took me away and gave me pills, they took me to doctors. For one week I was not able to work and then I had to work additionally. My nerves were so damaged I could not work with children ant longer. Because I was working with children, the principal then told me that my nerves are too tender to work with children, because whenever I go home I was wondering what would happen at home. And things have continued in that way with me in my house and with my children. I always thought about my children, I was concerned and worried about my children. I will never forget the 15th October. It felt like a war and it always felt as if they were going to kill people.",

            "Mrs Ryklief, I think the question that Dr Ramashala has just asked you is a very important one because you were involved in the trial and I'm sure that you have heard all the media around this case. It seems to me, and perhaps to many people, that the reasons offered in the trials and elsewhere was that these young people presented a very severe threat to the police. They were children who were endangering the lives of the police and therefore the police had to act in the way in which they had. It seems as though this is the kind of scenario that was presented to the nation and to the world during the hearings and so on. And of course we will try to hear all the versions in this events hearing. I feel that as I've said earlier on that the fact that we are having to relive these stories again brings lots and lots of emotions and lots and lots of feelings back to us. But we feel that you have made a very valuable contribution to young people. I feel very proud in one way that you felt the sense of responsibility to open up your door to protect young people, and to ensure that the lives of young people are protected. And it must mean something for you that you were able to make that contribution, but it also must mean something that even though you did that act, it was difficult for you to protect them from dying, particularly the ones who died in your home and that must be very hard for you to deal with. But we really do want to thank you for that very brave gesture of yours on trying to protect young people because ultimately that is what adults have to do. Adults have to protect the lives of young people and young people have to be able to look up to adults. It seems as though the custodians of care often do not  do that and we want to honour you today for being able to demonstrate what adults have to do for young people. Thank you very much.",

            "I am Shafwaan Ryklief, I'm the son of Mrs Ryklief. I was there when this incident happened. It was about 4:50pm, I came back from a friend's house. When I arrived home there were burning tyres in the street, there were a lot of students standing around. I was still attending school at that time. I ran into the house accompanied by a friend, Shaun Magmoed. We were attending school together. We were standing there and Ismail Abrahams was with us. The children were active outside, they had posters and other things and like my mother just said, Ismail Abrahams wanted to go home, he insisted to go home. When my mother opened the door, I went with him and while we were going out we just took two or three steps and we had to run back again. When we came into the house, we stood by the window and we could see what was going on. The first time an orange railway truck came from Lansdowne Road and drove in the direction of Athlone. Children were throwing stones at this truck. The second time this truck came up this road, this was when we left the house and that was then that these police came out of these crates and started shooting. They aimed in the direction of our house. What I'm trying to say is they aimed at the house and their intention was to shoot out the house and like my mother had said they were trying to kill us. I myself was not injured. I fell on the ground, my legs were shaking and I felt that something was wet and when I looked at my hands I saw that it was blood. I was the eldest and people assisted me, I can't remember who they were. When I regained consciousness, I was in hospital, I can't even remember which hospital. I was so unconscious of what was happening.\n It was a very sad and traumatic experience. This is a day I will never forget. I saw how my friend, Shaun Magmoed died. I cried by myself for months afterwards. To see how a friend dies, a friend with whom you went to school and everything, that is a horrible experience, and very sad. The last thing he said was \"Continue with the struggle, go on with the struggle\" and like my mother had said all of us are people, whether you are black, brown or white. We are all people and when they said \"That pig is dead\" that was not right.\n I don't want to tell that to somebody else. How would people from the police or the security forces like to hear that coming from me? From 1985 onwards, it has changed my life, it has changed my whole attitude to life. It was a disruptive force. I became a different person, and the things that I participated in eg sports, I could not participate anymore because of the injury in my legs. I could not participate anymore because my legs could not take it. I went to the hospital, I had to go for an operation but I could not afford it. They could not bring back all those things they had taken away from us. This is all I want to say.\n When they appeared in court, I do not think it was just that they were acquitted because for what they did to us, we do not want to pay them back but those policemen should be punished. They should be punished. I cannot see that they were acquitted, because how would they like that to have been done to their families? I will never forget their faces, especially the one who kicked open the door. This is all I would like to say at this stage.",

Because we were friends we all joined him. When we left the house, we had to run back because they were shooting at us. I and Shaun and other people, we ran and climbed under a dressing table to hide, and Shaun was lying on the bed. Shaun told me the struggle had to go on. And then he relieved himself and died.\n One policeman looked through the window and then he came to the door and asked us to open the door. We did not want to do that and he kicked open the door. He came straight to me and he pulled me towards him. My mother said he had to leave me alone. I was lying there, I was still small and I was very frightened. My brother came there and they said they must take my brother and leave me alone, and they took my brother and they pulled Shaun, lying at the end of the bed, they pulled him up and then they left him lying on the ground.\n They pulled out the phone, the cord of the phone, so we could not telephone anybody, because they did not want photographers or anybody to come to that house. People from the ambulance arrived there, they put him on a stretcher and took him out. They did not want my mother and the other people to look into the van where he was lying. They took him away and they took me to the hospital where there were a lot of policemen and a lot of questions were asked and we were guarded for the night. \n The next morning I was taken to a private doctor and only then I returned back to the home where I had been shot. That was where I was born and where I lived everyday. A lot of people gathered there that evening and they had to take us to various houses because they were looking for us. I stayed at other relatives, who were nearby. I stayed there during the night. I had a lot of pain and they had to rush me to a private doctor again. They found more bullets lodged in my body. And this private doctor cared for me.\n All of us then were staying at different houses and for seven years we went to the court, but nothing happened. We went to court, we told what happened and I pointed out the person who had kicked open the door but they were acquitted. Up until this day they are free men. I will never forget what happened.",

I visited doctors regularly, I went to a doctor a month ago, I have a problem with my knee, the side where I was shot and the doctor said that I had to go to a specialist to be operated on to determine what the problem is. I cannot afford that, and therefore I think that as long as I live I have to suffer, because it costs too much to have this knee operation. This is all I want to say about myself, but I will never forget what happened what happened on 15th October.",

I'd like to go back to the question of Shaun Magmoed, who is one of the victims, the sixteen year old young man who was shot on that day. You mentioned that he was in the house and he wasn't throwing stones, I just needed a bit more clarity about that. I know your mom, Mrs Zainab Ryklief, earlier on explained how close to the road your home is and I think, you know, we have been there, we kind of have a picture, it's right on the pavement, you just step out and onto the pavement and the road.\n Now at what point, I'm not sure at what point, Shaun Magmoed and yourselves left the house to observe what was happening outside, to see the truck coming, driving up and down. Could you explain it a bit more? At what point did you leave the house - so that I can understand, you know, kind of have a picture of when Shaun was shot and at what point he ran back into the house. Could you just explain please?",

I think you have, and the previous witnesses have, demonstrated very clearly that one event that takes five minutes, in fact has repercussions and effects which go on and on for many years.  And I want to thank you Shafwaan for being so honest about the effect that it had on you and your drug addiction, because you are certainly not the only person who has turned to drugs and alcohol to remember horrific events like these and I'm very happy to hear that you are not using drugs at the moment. I think this story also illustrates the bizarre nature of our society, in that it was thought appropriate to use guns and bullets against young children, who were only throwing stones. I think we all as Mr Williams said, we all say - how, why, what, how on earth can that happen. And part of the job of the truth commission is to try find an answer to those questions but also to make sure that that will not happen again. Thank you very much.",
