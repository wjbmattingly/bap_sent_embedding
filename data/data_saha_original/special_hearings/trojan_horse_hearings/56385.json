I would like to welcome here today the people who have come to testify before us and to thank them for having done so and also to welcome the members of the public who are here.\n We are particularly pleased to note that there are several schools who have sent groups of students here today.  I am told that Alexander Sinton, Bridgetown, Habibia and Belgravia High are represented.  And since part of the task of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to discover the truth of our history so that we may learn from it, it is particularly appropriate that young people should be here today, and we welcome you.   \n I bring you the greetings and apologies of our Chairperson, Archbishop Tutu who is unable to be with us here today.  \n I would just like to refer to yesterday's hearing when we heard from the people who were directly affected by the event which has become known as the Trojan Horse.  It was quite an emotional day and some of those family members will be joining us later today to be part of this hearing.  \n I would like to remind you all too that this is not a court proceeding, we will not be making findings at the end of this day.  The proceedings today are really today to help us, once again, to understand the reality of what happened during that period of conflict, of intense conflict in this part of Cape Town in 1985.  Our objective is to gather information, it's not accusatory and we expect everybody to help us to reach an understanding of what happened. So in that spirit we welcome you all here today.\n The various people who speak before us will be led by different members of our panel, so I would like to introduce you - on my left is Dr Mapule Ramashala and beside here Dumisa Ntsebeza.  On my right is Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, and to her right is Glenda Wildschut.  My name is Mary Burton.\n So without any further introduction we will proceed and the first person to testify before us is Brigadier Christiaan Loedolff and Dr Ramashala will introduce his evidence.\n I would ask Miss Wildschut to administer the oath but we are told that this witness will not swear the oath but will confirm his commitment to the contents of his statement.",

            "Chairperson I will now read my statement which I have affirmed.\n\"I Christiaan Loedolff declare as follows\n I am an adult male.  I am a retired Brigadier in the former South African Police and I live in Laaiplek.\n I received a notice to appear on the 21st of May this year before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to testify and to answer questions relating to the so-called Trojan Horse incident.  In order to assist the Commission I decided to make this statement.   \n During October 1985 I was a major in the then South African Railway Police.  I was the commanding officer of the regional task force of the South African Railway Police.  This regional task force did duty in the unrest racked areas along with members of the South African Police and the South African Defence Force.\n During October 1985 there were various incidents of unrest in and around Nyanga and also in Athlone.  These incidents usually were attacks aimed at private vehicles.  Vehicles were stoned and in some cases set alight.  In other cases blockades were erected to cause vehicles to stop and the vehicles were then damaged.  Attempts to arrest those responsible by means of normal police procedures were unsuccessful seeing as the people immediately fled as soon as they noticed police vehicles.\n Myself and the Commanding Officer of the South African Police and the South African Defence Force contingent, tasked with unrest control in a particular area planned, from a joint operational centre in Manenberg and we operated from that centre.  Colonel Janse van Rensburg of the South African Police, Commander S Pienaar of the South African Defence Force and myself decided during the afternoon of the 15th of October that the only way in which we would succeed in apprehending the main culprits behind these incidents of stoning etc would be to used an unmarked vehicle to enter the area with some members concealed on the truck so that if the vehicle was stoned it would then be able to follow and apprehend and arrest the attackers.  The problem was that we couldn't send in policemen in private clothes because it was important that those to be arrested had to realised that they were being arrested by Police.  The members therefore had to be able to act in uniform and we couldn't place members in full uniform on the back of tracks because that would also defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.  It was decided to use a Railways Police truck and to place crates on the back of this truck in which we could conceal members and in this way try to apprehend the attackers.\n I told Lt Douw Vermeulen of the South African Railway Police and I sent him a radio message to come and speak to me.  I then gave him an instruction to take some of his members and members of the South African Police who would be made available by Colonel van Rensburg and to launch this particular operation.  \n I explained to Vermeulen what we intended doing and showed him the truck to be used.  I specifically instructed him that the people who were to travel on this truck had to be armed with side arms as well as shotguns and they had to be given AAA bullets.  Heavier ammunition was not to be used.   \n I also explained to Vermeulen that should they find themselves in a situation where it was necessary to fire they had to exercise caution that those people on the left-hand side of the vehicle should not fire into the crates and thereby endangering their own comrades.  I accordingly instructed him that he had to ensure that they had to know exactly in which direction to fire if necessary.\n I can also remember that, according to Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Act it was also discussed with Vermeulen.  I explained the route to him, namely Klipfontein Road in the direction of the Athlone Police Station and then through Belgravia Road and Thornton Road and from there onwards to Lansdowne Road, around Crossroads and back to the Manenberg Police Station.  I made it very clear to Vermeulen that the whole object of the exercise was that those people responsible for the attacks had to be arrested.\nAt about 16H30 Lt Vermeulen department on this particular route and in this truck.  At 16H58 Sgt Sayer notified us that there had been an operation and that more people should be sent to Thornton.  An ambulance was immediately ordered to go to the area.\n As further radio reports came through a clearer picture began to emerge of what had happened. There had been an attack by people throwing stones and our members had reacted.  I was also notified that some of our members were lightly injured and that some people had been arrested.\n After an inquest into the matter had been finalised, myself and a couple of other people, inter alia Vermeulen and some of his other members were charged with murder in a private prosecution.  The Attorney General had declined to prosecute.  The prosecution followed a protracted trial of about five months and was unsuccessful.  An appeal was launched to the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein, that was similarly unsuccessful.\n I would like to point out that all efforts ....\"",

My immediate superior, on the Railway Police side, was in those years Brigadier Malan, but he had nothing to do with the planning and the work of JOCS in Manenberg, and he couldn't give us orders, because our orders, our JOC orders came via VAKOM and we were ordered via VAKOM to establish JOCS.  The commanding officer of JOCS was Piet van Rensburg.  He was a representative of the South African Police.\n If you look at this particular document now in front of you, you will see that each and every entity, whether the South African Police or the Defence Force or the Railway Police were commanded, were under their own command.  In other words, for a particular operation to take place it was only the commanding officer of that particular unit who could give orders to his own people.\n To make it a little bit easier to do our work in practice planning was done at this Joint Operational Command Centre at Manenberg and orders were there given as to what should happen.  When a joint operation was to take place the senior man was then in charge, whether it was from the South African Police side or the Railway Police side.  \n So to answer your question briefly, yes, I had to answer to Colonel Piet van Rensburg who was the head of the South African Riot Unit at that time.",

There was no way in 1985 for us to use the community in that area where the trouble spots were.\n What I am trying to say to you that in normal circumstances, to be able to apprehend the culprits you would expect that you could place policemen in that area in houses who would be able to observe what was happening.  The situation, at that stage, was such that the police weren't welcome anywhere in that area.  On the contrary, in certain areas in Athlone, I was refused a cool drink, I couldn't even buy a cool drink and the shopkeeper told me Sir, I am sorry if I sell you this cold drink I will have trouble in my shop this evening.  The result of this was that we couldn't place policemen in an area to monitor the area and to observe and then to facilitate our planning.\n Secondly, I have already told you that we could not send in marked vehicles and people in uniform because nothing would happen and then as soon as you withdrew the attacks would just start afresh.  In other words our only option was to send in an unmarked vehicle.  Now to send in such an unmarked vehicle and to place uniformed policemen in this unmarked vehicle would also serve no purpose, you'd have the same result, that you would enter such a situation the people would run away and once again you would not have a successful peacekeeping operation and you would not be able to apprehend culprits.\n So we were forced to send in this vehicle in some way, clearly marked with a South African Police number, because at that stage it was the delivery trucks and vehicles that were being attacked, so we had no other choice but to send in this vehicle and to make it look as close as possible, to make it look like a delivery truck, and then to use the trucks and to conceal the policemen in the crates because that was the whole purpose of the operation, to get the policemen to the culprits to be able to arrest them.

It was not the first time that they were issued with shotguns and told you have to use this thing.  These people were trained, they knew how to operate shotguns.\n If you look at Thornton Road, specifically at the area where this incident took place, you will see that the road is quite narrow and I've already said, if a person was fired at directly with any kind of shot he would die.  If you take into account the fact that there were 35 shots fired, that's how I understand it, if 35 shots are fired at a crowd, a crowd of between 115 to 100 people and the intention was to shoot to kill, then many, many more than three people would have died.  \n If you bear in mind, I am sure you have seen the video regarding the so-called Trojan Horse incident shown by the Media, if you look at the way in which the people were standing in the crates and they were about 2.5 to 3 metres above the ground and you look at the general direction in which they were aiming you will notice that they weren't actually firing at the crowd.  Even if warning shots had been fired in the sense of firing at the ground, with the bullets ricocheting then there would have been many more deaths.  But I am convinced, and I am really as honest as it is for a person to be, I am convinced in my heart that if the instruction was to shoot to kill and these people had performed this instruction to shoot to kill then there would have been a tragedy on that day.  \n This was a specific instruction to arrest people and in the process of performing arrests an attack was averted.

When you responded to Dr Ramashala's question in which you used the word sharp-shooters you responded that if sharp-shooters were used then a tragedy would have occurred.  You did also say in your other answers to questions that you regret very much the deaths that occurred that day, I would think that we all agree that a tragedy did occur on that day.  But perhaps on that day and in those circumstances it would not have been able to participate the tremendous national and international response that there was to this event, and I just wonder, in the light of your objective which was to combat the unrest, to effect arrests, whether at the end of that day you felt that the operation had been a success or a failure?",

That was never our intention and it was not foreseen.  That was not the purpose of the whole operation.\n And if I look back today after 12 years, and I look back with hindsight then I would say that if I was to plan such an operation again I wouldn't be involved in such an operation, on the planning thereof.  But the circumstances in those times forced us to take certain steps and that which we didn't foresee took place.\n I think I am speaking not only on my own behalf but on behalf of all those involved in the operation.  We bitterly regret what happened.  We deeply regret the fact that children were killed, as we regret the death of each and every person in the execution of police duties because that is not the duty of a police officer.  The duty of the police is to maintain law and order, but in the process of maintaining law and order these things happen.  These things are realities and people must accept them, but that doesn't mean we are insensitive and that does not mean that we are not sorry about what happened.",
