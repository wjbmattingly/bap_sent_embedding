The panel as well interested counsel have had an opportunity to identify him.  Thereafter we will call Dr Rocky Williams from the side of the Defence Force and after the lunch break Mr Howard Varney will make an unsworn submission and those parties represented here who wish to make a counter or rebutting submission, will have a limited opportunity to do so, bearing in mind the time limits which are available to us.  We have - it has been indicated to us by counsel for General Liebenberg that they would want to make such a submission and they can do so after Mr Varney's evidence.  If anybody else representing implicated persons wishes to make a short submission, if they could please notify Mr Macadam during the break so that we can look at limiting the length of these submissions so that we are able to finish this afternoon.  \nFor those people in the audience who wish to follow the proceedings with the use of earphones, the evidence - the first witness will give his evidence in Zulu and it will be broadcast in English in the hall, but there are earphones available for those who want to follow it in Afrikaans or in the original Zulu.\nDr Boraine who was with us for the last two days is not here today and he will not be returning to the panel and I would like to welcome another member of the Truth\n /Commission\n1A Commission, Professor Simangele Magwaza from the Reparations Committee.\nI think those are all the opening remarks I want to make.

His evidence will continue after the hearings dealing with the Caprivi training and we have good reason to believe that Mr Luthuli gave a press conference after the Commission adjourned yesterday, which is something we believe amounts to a gross irregularity.  This morning I contacted Mr Macadam to ascertain what transpired and he seems to be more familiar with the facts.  He's definitely not involved in the press conference and we are not suggesting the Commission had anything to do with this.  I would appreciate it if he could just indicate to the Commission what his understanding of what transpired yesterday, what took place, in other words, yesterday, if he could just indicate what took place yesterday, for the benefit of the Commission.

I noticed at the adjournment of the proceedings, while I was preparing my files for today's proceedings that Mr Luthuli was surrounded by a number of people on the stage before he left the actual stage, but what transpired at that stage I'm not aware.  I may place further on record that I had occasion to listen to the 8 o'clock news broadcast on TV3 where the - Mr Luthuli was reported as having indicated that Minister Buthelezi was aware of his activities or had sanctioned them, words to that effect, but as I understand Mr Luthuli's evidence, at no stage did he in any stage implicate the Minister.  All his allegations related to Mr Khumalo.  I'm not - I cannot comment on where the television got that information from, whether it's a misquote of Mr Luthuli's original evidence or whether it was information volunteered after the adjournment of the proceedings.",

Mr Luthuli has come forward over the process of a number of years now wishing to tell the truth as he experienced it and as it happened and that's what he wishes to do before the Truth Commission now and in due course in his amnesty application and he is committed to doing that and he shows no disrespect to the Commission.  Quite the contrary, he is committed to the process that the TRC is embarked in.\n /There\n1A There is nothing which prohibits him from also speaking the truth, as he knows it, elsewhere than before the Commission and in clarifying certain questions or certain matters which he had given in evidence yesterday and clarifying them to the press yesterday evening, which is what happened and what the press had sought, he didn't contradict in any way the testimony that he had given before the Commission yesterday and merely answered some questions that the press had asked which they may well have felt that Commissioners may have asked Mr Luthuli in order to clarify certain aspects of his evidence.\nAnd if I may say one additional thing and that's in response to Mr Macadam, the record of course will reveal it, but in my recollection it's not quite accurate to say that Mr Buthelezi wasn't implicated in any way in yesterday's testimony.  He was implicated in certain respects about functions which took place when the trainees returned from Caprivi, so there were certain aspects in which he was mentioned and in that sense implicated.\nI have nothing further to say.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman and members of the Commission.  My name is Patrick Falconer.  I act on behalf of the Inkatha Freedom Party and Minister Buthelezi.\n /Certain\n1A Certain events which Mr Lasich and Mr Macadam have alluded to took place after this Commission adjourned yesterday, which we find extremely disturbing.\nAt 7.00 pm last night I was telephonically contacted by a journalist who identified himself as Allan from Reuters.  He notified me that a press conference had been held here after the Commission had adjourned and that certain questions were put to Mr Luthuli which incriminated Minister Buthelezi.  In fact he allegedly answered a question stating that Minister Buthelezi must have been fully aware of the hit squad activities.\nI am also advised that at 8 o'clock last night and in subsequent news broadcasts on the SABC, including the Zulu news broadcast similar reporting was made.  I have managed to acquire the introduction portion of the SABC 8 o'clock news broadcast last night and I wish to read a portion of that.\n\"Former IFP hit squad leader, Daluxolo Luthuli says there is no way that Inkatha leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi could have been unaware of the killings committed by the Caprivi trainees in KwaZulu-Natal in the mid eighties\".\nI am presently awaiting video footage of all of the news broadcasts.\nAs the legal representative for Mr Luthuli says, all he did was say certain things in clarification.  Unfortunately our recollection does not go to any evidence of this nature having been tendered before this Commission.  He clearly exceeded what he had told this Commission.\n /In\n1A In our view, Mr Chairman, this conduct constitutes a prima facie offence, a violation of the provisions of Section 39(a), (b) and (c) of your Act and I'll read 39(c) -\n\"Any person who does anything in relation to the Commission which, if done in relation to a Court of Law, would constitute contempt of Court\".\nWe submit that Mr Luthuli's behaviour and anyone who may have advised him to so behave constitutes a criminal offence.\nI have had opportunity to take instructions from Minister Buthelezi this morning.  He has asked me to voice this objection.  He has informed me that he is astounded by the allegations that have been made and he vehemently denies any implication or knowledge with the hit squad allegations.\nMr Chairman, I would like to just take this opportunity to point out that a further difficulty which we have is that many high profile people in this country, of influence, are being implicated in allegations.  Once such statements are made it constitutes irreparable damage, no matter what apologies are made thereafter.\nWe accordingly request that those involved act more responsibly and not permit certain statements to be made to the public until such time that this Commission has had an opportunity to properly evaluate all the evidence and make its findings.\nIn the circumstances we require, before continuing and participating and lending this Commission our co-operation, an unconditional undertaking from Mr Luthuli\n /and\n1A and those instructing him - advising him, at least, that they shall not make any further such statements until the Commission makes its findings or a report.  We require a ruling from this Commission to the effect that a directive be issued to all witnesses and the media that no such conduct shall be tolerated in the future and an apology from Mr Luthuli and those advising him for his improper conduct.  We would also appreciate a proper explanation as to what exactly transpired.\nThank you, Mr Chairman.\nMR   (?): Sorry, Mr Chairperson, obviously the parties I represent are potentially in a similar category and I would just like a further explanation from the representatives of the IFP as to the basis for the allegation that Mr Luthuli is guilty of contempt of Court.  My understanding of the provisions of the Act are entirely the contrary.",

            "Thank you.  We've had an opportunity to discuss this matter during a short adjournment.\nMr Falconer raised four issues relating to -\n(1) an undertaking from Mr Luthuli that he would not make such statements or take such action again;\n(2) a ruling from the Commission that witnesses should not in the future do what Mr Luthuli is alleged to have done yesterday;\n(3) an apology from Mr Luthuli;  and\n(4) a proper explanation from Mr Luthuli and his counsel as to why this took place yesterday.\nWith regard to (1), (3) and (4), that's the undertaking from Mr Luthuli, an apology from Mr Luthuli and a proper explanation, the Commission clearly cannot play a part in this at all.  This is something which Mr Falconer should take up directly with Mr Luthuli and his counsel and I would advise him to do that at a later stage.  It is not something which the Commission can involve itself in at all.\nWith regard to (2) a ruling from the Commission that witnesses should not engage in this sort of behaviour.  We must realise here that we are dealing with competing rights, rights of Mr Luthuli;  the rights of Mr Buthelezi and the rights of the press and these are equal rights that these various people enjoy.  This Commission is committed to transparency and we feel that we are not able to make a ruling which would seek to in any way muzzle the\n /right\n1A right of Mr Luthuli to say what he wishes to say.  It should be borne in mind that these issues can be taken up with Mr Luthuli when he is cross-examined and counsel for Minister Buthelezi and the IFP will have a full opportunity to rebut these allegations in public.  So the Commission cannot make a ruling with regard to the second issue raised by Mr Falconer.\nAnd finally, if there is a feeling that there has been a breach of Act 34 of 1995, then this is obviously something which Mr Falconer and his client should take up with the SAP.\nI think that is all I need to say at this stage.",

Mr Chairperson, members of the Committee, I would like to respond on behalf of Mr Luthuli to the three requests that were put by Mr Falconer that relate directly to him.\nThe first one was that of an undertaking not to speak to the press.  At this stage Mr Luthuli makes no such undertaking.  He will speak to the press as advised and cautiously and in showing no disrespect to the Commission.  That is something on which further discussion can take place, of course.\nSecondly, in regard to the apology, Mr Luthuli makes no apology for the statement he made.  He reiterates and he stands by that statement which was that Minister Buthelezi must have known about the hit squad activities that took place and that were carried out and conducted by the Caprivi trainees.\nIn the event that Mr Falconer's client has any remedies, those would be in the Criminal or Civil Law rather than before this Commission.\n /As\n1A As far as the fourth matter is concerned which was the explanation as to what took place, that explanation has already been given initially by Mr Macadam and subsequently by myself.

When one speaks about the principles of war, one speaks about a very wide range of principles, including the political objective, including the concept of manoeuvre, the principle of manoeuvre including the principle of surprise and simplicity and security, but one of the key principles is the principle of the offensive, because without the offensive it makes it extremely difficult for an armed organisation to actually accomplish the political objective that has actually been set for it, so I - the point of departure would be that the offensive lies at the heart of military",

I think it's important as well to stress that there are different levels at which offensive can be defined and indeed different levels at which defensive can be defined and I'll briefly mention then at the strategic level a country can have an offensive posture, it can also have a defensive posture and that basically reflects the national political intent of the country.  Is a country's intent towards neighbouring states hostile and aggressive, i.e. do they intend to actually invade it?  At a strategic level, if that's the case, then you would say the strategic disposition of country is offensive.  If one is speaking about an operational level, one would say that at the level of the battle, the - a country would have the capacity to react pre-emptively, to attack offensively and to actually wage offensive combat within the sphere of the battle.  That's the second level.  I think the third level at which the word \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" can be used is at the tactical level.  That's really at the level of the skirmish.  That's in an immediate area of operation, it's not a particularly range and gathering from what the witnesses have said here, that's the level that the personnel referred to and trained here were actually deployed was more at a tactical level.

Universally I think it is regarded that Klausavit(?) who wrote the book on war provides and is regarded as possibly the most authoritive person on military strategy and Klausavit says quite simply that the three characteristics that define the offensive are threefold.  The first if the capacity to invade a country and to occupy it;  the second is the capacity to undermine the enemy's political will and capability to wage war and thirdly - and this third one really goes to the heart of what makes the military offensive unique as opposed to political or economic - the third aspect is it is the ability of a country of one(?) armed force to annihilate and to destroy the enemy, because at the end of the day that is what armed forces are trained for, unlike other organisations.  That's the particular nature of the contract they have, either with the State or with the body politic.  So that in essence is the nature of the offensive.

You've got to preserve your own power base.  This accords with your general principles of war.  It's pointless going on to the offensive if your own power base is not secure, because if your own power base is going to be undermined, well, then you can't wage war, logically and self-evidently.  So he says you've got to preserve your own power base;  ensure that your own social and political support base and your infrastructure support base is intact and then at the same time one must obviously continue waging war against the enemy, but that's not sufficient.

It's got to work all the way down from national literally to village level or local level, be it rural or urban and it's got to be between such critical actors as the political authorities, the political elite.  It's got to be between the civilian administration and it's got to be between the armed forces.  It can't become a purely military exercise and it can't become a purely political or civilian exercise.  All these - it's a difficult thing to achieve.  It's more difficult for the State to achieve that than a revolutionary organisation.  The State has a whole lot of judicial, juridical, legal and political constraints that hamper that unity of effort, but a high level of unity effort is required in order to accomplish those objectives.

Militarily a number of strategies were followed which were consistent with the rural counter insurgency campaign.  The first was there were levels of area protection to protect the local population;  a number of cross-border raids were launched;  there were search and destroy operations in some cases across the border in Angola, but also in Angola there was a concomitant strategy of trying to empower UNITA as what was seen as a moderate option to MPLA via the provision of logistical and financial support so as to enable UNITA to establish both a presence inside Angola and ultimately to possibly constitute a government in Angola which would then advantage the perceived stabilisation of Namibia, South West Africa, both politically and militarily.

For instance the basic training provided to these people is the type of basic training you'd receive in any military organisation.  It's PT, it's drill, it's musketry, it's field craft and, I mean, that's done throughout the world, at least in the 20th century.  The type of training that they begin to receive in terms of weapons corresponds in my reading more to what would be called basic infantry weapons training or platoon weapons training.  That includes both small calibre and heavy calibre weaponry.  Once again, if you're going to train a standard infantry unit, that's the type of weaponry that they'd actually be exposed to at the end of the day, although if these units were going to be trained for more defensive purpose, I would submit that training them in mortars, in this case the small mortars, 60mm mortars, training them in rocket launchers and that, may be a useful exercise, but if the declared purpose is simply VIP protection and defensive, it's a moot point why they were actually being trained in that, but be that as it may.  Maybe that type of exposure is of benefit to the creation of military culture and a military mind.  The training in plastic explosives, in home-made explosives as was confirmed over here, is a bit more difficult to comprehend, because it's difficult to see where that actually fits in.  It's a very wide training base that you're actually providing to people, but if the declared intention was simply to train them for defensive purposes, as you mention now, then I would say two things need to be",

No type of weaponry or equipment is inherently offensive and defensive bar obvious examples like intercontinental ballistic missiles and aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons.  It's very much the intention, the doctrine and the anticipated deployment behind the armed forces.  They tell you what, whether the nature of the training is offensive or defensive or for what purpose it's going to be oriented.  So that's why I say they received training in this, but the moment one starts speaking of training like house penetration, attacks, ambushes, concealment of evidence and the other things that were actually referred to, one is moving into a much more grey area, into a much more offensive, one would read, if one is training people for those type of purposes, in which those weapons would be less used in a defensive role.  I think the Liebenberg Report, the former Chief Army General Liebenberg, refers to the type of training that a defensive element should receive and he says so in the report, it should be in basic military procedures, crowd control, protection of installations and he mentions a couple of other - I can't remember them off-hand, but - small calibre weapons, but here you're speaking about heavier calibre weapons;  you're speaking about the ability to plant and detonating - make explosives;  you're speaking about, at a tactical level, a more offensive role.  So one would read into that that regardless of whether we actually look at whether it was an offensive or a defensive unit, you're reading into that a much more proactive role for the personnel who had been trained and who you intend deploying.",

Before we resume, I think it is proper for me, through you, Chairperson, to make an observation about certain remarks that have been going on since the beginning of these proceedings.\nThe substance of the remarks, especially today, something I will comment on in a moment, but I think what we need to say is that we must support these proceedings, the sort of decorum that we accord proceedings in a Court of Law.  We have made the point that we are not in a court, that we are not a Court of Law, but the point must be made that the decorum that attaches to these proceedings is the decorum that would fit a Court of Law.\nI am particularly perturbed that I should address the remarks to my colleagues, to lawyers.  Since the inception of these proceedings there are many remarks that have been made that are of a destructing(?) nature.\nAttorneys and counsel have remarked loudly in some instances, whilst proceedings are going on.  You will recall that in today's proceedings I had the occasion to intervene when a witness had indicated where he was shot.  Now I'm subject to correction, but I think I heard the distinct remark when the witness said he was shot in the foot, that there was a remark coming from my left which is where the lawyers are sitting, that that is where his brains are.  Now I'm subject to correction.  \nNow if I've heard that remark, not only is the remark offensive for what it says, but it address what I want to be saying, namely that these loud remarks are of a nature that cause us to be distracted from the business\n /which\n2B which we are here gathered about.  Of course, if the remark that I heard is what I think I heard, it is offensive in the extreme.  It does not help the process for which this Commission was set up and given the race of the person who was testifying at the time and generally the race of those who are the legal representatives here, if the remark as I said that I heard is what I think I heard, it's very unfortunate.\nI'm not making an issue about it.  I'm simply saying I would expect that in this particular proceedings we should conduct ourselves in a way in which we would conduct ourselves in Courts of Law.  That goes generally for the public, but it goes generally and particularly for my colleagues, lawyers, who should know better.",

            "Mr Chairman, may I at this point in time - it's Mr Van Zyl speaking - before this witness testifies, there's just certain remarks that I would like to make, if you would allow me at this stage, please.\nI understand from the Committee that the position is currently that a decision has been made, a final decision by yourselves to the effect that the witness, Mr Varney, should not be cross-examined and viewed in the light of the time available for his evidence and the time constraints occasioned by the fact that he is leaving the country tomorrow, there will be no time for cross-examination at this stage.  However, there are certain aspects which I would like to place on record in this regard and the first aspect is that the clients represented by myself, about nine in number and two of these have had their names mentioned by witnesses who have already testified.  I assume that there will be no further witnesses, other than Mr Varney, who could possibly implicate any of my clients.\nThe effect of that and this is my submission that the rest of my clients, other than the two whose names\n /have\n2B have been mentioned, although one of them will also be implicated by Mr Varney's submission, that these people have been notified because Mr Varney was to testify before this Commission and during which testimony the persons would have been implicated and if that was not to be the case there would be no purpose in notifying these people.\nThe Commission this morning indicated ... [break in recording] ... and also in the search of truth.  It's my submission that in not being given the opportunity to cross-examine Mr Varney on certain aspects which relate to my clients and which implicate my clients is not, with respect, the correct way of pursuing the truth.  You have indicated that you will make no findings, but that a finding will be made at a later stage.\nWhat is however worrying in this regard is the fact that a certain value must be placed or attached to Mr Varney's submission and at this stage it's very unclear how this will be done and what value will be attached to his evidence seen in the light of the fact that he will testify without having sworn the oath and without any opportunity for cross-examination.  It also creates a problem for those people who at a later stage must make a finding, seeing as they will not have tested evidence on which to base their decision.\nAs far as Mr Varney's submission is concerned, it is also my submission that that will be a mere interpretation of certain documents and testimony adduced during the so-called Malan trial last year and that is, in my submission, the function of the Commission and not the function of a witness who, by way of submission, an unsworn submission, then puts forward his version and\n /interpretation.\n2B interpretation.\nIt is also my submission that with the benefit of instructions from certain clients who were authors of some of these mentioned documents that in all probability a very short period of time by means of cross-examination, the correct versions or the versions of our clients could have been put to this witness in order to arrive at the truth and that could also have had the effect that Mr Varney could in respect of certain conclusions and inferences which he has made could perhaps changed these or changed his views.  \nIt also would appear to a person that in the light of the fact that notice has been given that Mr Varney will testify and I assumed under oath, that such a notification was given to a colleague's attorney, to the effect that Mr Varney's evidence will be the only evidence which will implicate his client.  However, that letter was dated the 1st of August of this year and it would seem as if meanwhile a decision has been taken that Mr Varney will not testify under oath and I would like to enquire to enable me to evaluate his evidence.  I'd like to argue and take certain points of view and in order to be able to do that I would like to know who took this decision and why this was taken.\nThe prejudice to my clients is, with respect, not only a potential of prejudicial findings which could be made against them, but it's also seated in the fact that there's been wide media coverage of this matter and these proceedings, it will probably be broadcast on the news tonight and also broadcast abroad, also in the press.  Mr Varney's evidence will be quoted or will be referred\n /to.\n2B to.  This will have the effect that the image created as regards my clients and insofar as they are implicated, that this could be very prejudicial to their interests and this could mean that they will be permanently implicated in a negative sense.",

            "(?)   Mr Chairman, there's one or two aspects that I indicated that I'd also like to put on record earlier on this morning.\nPertaining to this debate about the remark, I'd like to put on record that no such remark came from any of the  representatives that represents my clients.\nThe issues that I'd like to put on record are very similar to that that has been raised by my learned friend.  Before the Committee proceeds to accept the submission of Mr Varney I'd like clarification on the following issues which are of vital importance to the clients I represent.\nThe Section 30 notice which was served on our clients is based on allegations contained in the Varney report.  At all stages we were brought under the direct impression that Mr Varney will testify in this regard.\n /I firstly\n2B I firstly refer to a letter dated the 30th of July 1997 where the chairman, Mr Lyster, indicated that cross-examination of Mr Varney will be allowed, but it will be limited.  I furthermore refer to a letter sent to General Groenewald on the 2nd of June 1997 where it is indicated that Mr Varney will be a witness.  At a later stage the Committee made a ruling that Mr Varney will no longer be giving evidence, but that he would only be making submissions.  I request the Committee to clarify by supplying reasons why the Committee decided that Mr Varney need not testify.  It possibly appears that the sole reason for this decision is the fact that the Committee does not wish possibly to have his allegations contained in the Varney report tested under cross-examination.\nFurthermore, the main reason why were here is because we were brought under the impression that he is going to testify and that we will be able to test the veracity of the allegations contained in this report.\nFurthermore, we request reasons as to why the Committee is of the opinion that Mr Varney has the necessary locus standi to make a submission.  On behalf of who does he make a submission and it's clear that in the normal procedure a submission relates to evidence that has been given during a hearing.\nThe submissions that Mr Varney makes do not relate to any evidence that has been led in these proceedings or that the Committee intends dealing in these proceedings.\nIt is furthermore submitted that it is procedurally unfair and the rules of natural justice have not been applied.  Due to the fact that the allegations contained in the Varney report have been referred in national\n /television\n2B television and in the press, it is our submission that this report contains very serious allegations against the clients I represent.  There are factual inaccuracies and inferences are drawn from the factual inaccuracies.  Obviously these untested allegations severely prejudice our clients.\nAs late as the 5th of August a letter was sent to an attorney Coetzee that states that Mr Varney will be called as a witness.  I beg leave to hand up the documentation that are referred to indicating that the information - I beg leave to hand it up to the Committee.  I'm indebted.",

It seems that there was no such agreement and we are disappointed that only at this late stage are we told that there is in fact no such agreement and that there is still an insistence on cross-examination.\nIn view of the fact that time is clearly of the essence and that Mr Varney is leaving the country tomorrow we have decided the following that Mr Varney will give\n /evidence\n2B evidence under oath and that he will do so for a period of at least one hour;  that counsel will have a very limited opportunity to conduct cross-examination of Mr Varney and this will probably only extend to about one and a half hours and thereafter, if any counsel present wish to make submissions - to submissions with regard to Mr Varney's evidence, that they do so tomorrow or at the end of the proceedings.\nIn view of the time constraints I wish to draw specific attention to remarks which I made at the beginning of these proceedings on Monday which are set out in Regulation 6.1 of the determined procedures for the hearing and also in remarks which I made in my opening address where I said that the panel will not permit any evidence - sorry, any cross-examination which amounts to a repetition of versions which have already been put forward in other forums.\nWith regard to locus standi of Mr Varney, this Committee - this Commission, in fact, is at liberty to request persons to make submissions and to give evidence before it and it has done so on many, many other occasions and it has asked people who do not represent any particular group or community or organisation to do so.  We believe that Mr Varney has locus standi.  He was - you will be aware he was appointed by the Minister of Law and Order specifically to investigate ... (inaudible) ... in KwaZulu-Natal.  He has an intimate knowledge of the political conflict in this province and we have no hesitation in believing that he is an appropriate person to make a submission here today.\nI think those are all the remarks that I need to\n /make.\n2B make.

            "  This hearing focuses on human rights violations carried out by state sponsored hit squads operating in the townships of Mpumalanga in the late 1980s and Esikaweni in the early 1990s.  This violence caused untold destruction and misery to the residents of these townships.  The wider evidence suggests that much of this organised violence had its roots in certain state initiatives taken in the mid 1980s.  These activities were the subject of intensive investigations undertaken by the Investigation Task Unit, the ITU, between 1994 and 1996.  The ITU's primary brief was to investigate hit squad activities carried out under the cover of the KwaZulu Police.  I have been asked to give an overview of the picture unearthed by the ITU.  This story, I believe, explains how it was possible for hit squads such as the Esikaweni hit squad, to act with impunity for several years.  This particular story relates to acts of violence and brutality committed against supporters of the United Democratic Front and the African National Congress by hit squads of the Inkatha Freedom Party and KwaZulu supported by the former National Party controlled South African Government and its security organs.  It does not suggest that the IFP was not the target of similar actions launched by the ANC and UDF.  Numerous IFP member, KZP members and others involved in governmental structures were the targets of hit squad actions launched by the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto weSizwe, Self Defence Units and militant comrades.

It is not the aim of this Commission to apportion blame on to one side or another.  Members on both sides have been both perpetrators and victims.  It is however plain to see that the conflict was not a matter of acts carried out aimlessly ... [break in recording] ... on all sides.  Sadly, with regard to KwaZulu-Natal we are still waiting for political leaders - on all sides of the political spectrum - to display statesmanship by revealing their roles in this war.  True conciliation and peace will not be achieved by face-saving disclosures behind closed doors and secret amnesty deals.  Only the truth boldly stated and for all to see will permit us to put the past behind us.  At the end of the Commission's term I believe that the central question it must answer on the set of facts arising out of this inquiry is whether the Caprivi operatives such as Luthuli and Mkhize who have testified in this hearing acted out a series of unconnected private frolics, or whether they were not part of a wider strategy devised and orchestrated at the highest political levels.  I will argue that the documentary and oral evidence and the probabilities point conclusively to the latter.  Moving to my introduction, in the case of Esikaweni the High Court in the matter of S v Mbambo made a finding that organised hit squads were responsible for much of the violence in the area between 1992 and 1993.

It is simply the means that I believe is the subject matter of this particular debate and it is the means I would argue have been objectionable.  Central to the hit squad actions in Esikaweni, Mpumalanga and elsewhere were the Caprivi trainees.  For this reason it is necessary to examine the source of this group in the mid 1980s.  It is my submission that those who gave birth to the Caprivi trainees are ultimately accountable for the actions taken by that group.  The training and deployment of the Caprivi trainees fell squarely within the strategies adopted by the South African State in the mid 1980s.  The State perceived itself to be facing an onslaught of total revolutionary war from within and outside South Africa.  To combat this threat the State employed counter revolutionary strategies which involved the taking of a wide range of actions.  These included political, psychological, economic and security or forceful measures.  By the mid 1980s political and violent actions executed by anti-apartheid groups such as the ANC and allied organisations had reached unprecedented levels.  The State adopted equally drastic measures to counter these threats and these measures included acts of terrorism and guerilla warfare.  They were carried out by specific security organs and \"middle\" or counter revolutionary groups within and outside South Africa.  The IFP's SADF trained offensive element was a case in point of such operation carried out within South Africa.  The operation was codenamed \"Marion\" and was executed by Intelligence Operations Directorate of Special Tasks, DST.  DST's support of groups such as Renamo in Mozambique and Unita",

I think I am going to emphasise that.  Here we are talking about or the document refers to those involved in the planning of Operation Marion may be charged with offences carrying the death penalty because offensive actions were part of Marion's tasks.  I think the Commission will have little difficulty in comprehending and understanding the meaning of such passages.  The documents speak for themselves.  To extract an innocent interpretation requires in my view the taking of an adventure into the absurd.  If the Commission declines to engage in such theatrics it must consider whether the conduct was confined to the parties actually implicated in the documents, that is the military command structure, or whether there was a connection that led to higher levels.  Put another way, did those in the organising structures at the highest political levels approve of an entirely laudable project which the military and Inkatha behind their backs subverted into something unlawful and monstrous?  There is nothing in my view to support this proposition.  This submission will endeavour to show that there was an unbreakable connection between the authorisation by the highest political structures of offensive support to Inkatha and the passages that I have just referred to.

In short, it is my submission that the references to an offensive capacity and offensive actions refer to an ability to carry out pro-active actions against enemy targets.  This resulted in the committal of an unquantifiable number of extra-judicial killings.  It is my further submission that it is not only those who carried out the ground who are responsible, but those who facilitated the launching of the operation in the first place.  So my submission will accordingly highlight the roles of those who authorised its provision and those who requested it in the first place.  It is plain to see that these politicians anticipated that the supplying of an offensive unit together with arms and ammunition to a civilian organisation involved in an on-going violent conflict would result in attacks being launched against the political opponents of the organisation in question.  Although the South African Defence Force had withdrawn support for offensive operations by the end of the 1980s and this was because the military feared exposure of its own role following the arrests of trainees who were involved in offensive actions, it was always an aim of Operation Marion to provide Inkatha with a capacity of self-sufficiency to enable it to act independently of the SADF.  Now the security concerns that I have referred to led ultimately to the placing of most of the placing of most of the trainees into the KwaZulu Police during mid 1989 and hit squad activities continued under the cover of the KwaZulu Police through into the 1990s.

In my view that was an incorrect finding.  While the offensive actions envisaged were aimed at preventing or stopping the ANC and UDF from carrying out attacks on Inkatha members, they were intended to be in the form of initiative-taking actions, in other words pre-emptive strikes.  Now seen from the perspective of Inkatha and the State, this objective can be described as \"protective\".

Before dealing with Operation Marion in greater detail, I intend to set the scene or, as one of my learned friends said yesterday or the day before, to set the stage, to explain how projects such as Marion and others came into being.  Marion did not take place in a vacuum.  It was part and parcel of the State's counter revolutionary programme that was in place at the time and it is necessary to examine this background in some detail.  So I now move to the chapter called \"Context\" and under the sub-heading, \"Counter Revolutionary Strategies\".  During the 1980s the State Security Council, which I am going to refer to as the SSC and its superior and subordinate bodies devised several strategies for deployment against the UDF and the ANC.  The government adopted the guiding strategies of Counter Revolutionary Warfare principles.  These principles involved tactics aimed at destroying or annihilating the insurgents and revolutionaries while winning the hearts and minds of the population.  Key tactics included the use of terror in certain circumstances and the establishment of \"counter guerilla\" or \"middle groups\" to mobilise politically and to act violently against revolutionary forces.  Now this is evidence from a number of documents.  A State Security Council meeting held in July 1985 a number of Counter Revolutionary Warfare principles were adopted under item 8.

The document was a paraphrasing of General Fraser's paper titled, \"Lessons learnt from past revolutionary wars\".  I shall refer to this document as the Fraser document.  Now both the Botha document and the Fraser document referred to the careful weighing up of the use of force before it is used.  Fraser's original document which was uplifted from the Defence Force's own records, specifically related the use of force to acts of terrorism in this particular chapter.  Terrorism was referred to as a particularly appropriate weapon since it aims directly at the inhabitant.  Now Fraser was at pains to caution against the indiscriminate use of terror.

The SSC at its meeting of the 12th of May 1986 tasked the then Ministers of Defence and Law and Order to create a Third Force to effectively wipe out terrorists.  The security forces were further tasked with countering the underminers using their own methods and I think we should stress that particular passage out of the SSC Minuted, \"using their own method\".  It is entirely in line with what counter revolutionary writers have been advocating.  The SADF in an earlier document compiled by one Brigadier Ferreira of the office of the Chief of Army set out to a lesser or greater degree where this Third Force already existed and according to paragraph 6 of his document this Third Force was situated within the following organs.  The SADF's counter insurgency forces;  the SADF's Special Forces;  the SADF's Special Tasks;  the SAP's Security Police;  the SAP's counter insurgency forces and the SAP's Special Task Force",

Now DST and the other departments mentioned in the Ferreira document set out to counter the revolutionaries using their own methods as directed by the SSC and in pursuance of this plan, leaders, activists and supporters of the ANC and UDF and allied organisations were targeted for elimination.  By way of an example, an aspect of Operation Marion involved the elimination of enemy targets and this I will deal with in some detail later and we have seen through amnesty hearings and other documents that have come to light that similar actions were carried out by DST's Operation Katzen in the Eastern Cape;  and operations of the SADF's Special Forces, the CCB and the SAP's C10 Unit or Vlakplaas and C4, Trewitts, which played a co-ordinating role.

Now according to an SADF general, Marius Oelschig, who was called as an expert in the Malan matter, he referred to the phases of revolutionary war and he quoted from documents as to how important it was that a state facing a revolutionary onslaught needed to know what phase that revolutionary struggle was in, in order to be able to determine the counter measures to be taken against the revolutionaries.  Now he described South African during the mid 1980s as going through a phase of revolutionary war which was going from terrorism to guerilla warfare and perhaps let's pause and look at what these four distinct phases are.  The first phase is organisation or mobilisation.  The second phase is terrorism.  The third phase is guerilla warfare and the fourth phase is mobile war, almost on a scale of conventional war.  So the State saw itself in that third phase during the mid 1980s or going from terrorism to guerilla warfare.  The State then adopted equally drastic measures, equally war-like measures to counter this threat including terror and guerilla warfare.

They have to act within the confines of the law and within the confines of the Criminal Procedure Act and they are taught that law.  These trainees were never taught that law.  However, the security structure would have been of practical assistance insofar as it would act as a cover for their offensive operations and indeed the trainees were issued with fake security company ID cards and several were issued with false KwaZulu Police appointment certificates and this permitted them to get away with murder;  it permitted them to escape detection.  In the same document, the protective and the offensive capacities were clearly distinguished as separate entities.  Now the obvious question which ought to be raised is, if we were to believe and accept the argument that this group was simply going to carry out purely protective and lawful duties.  Why then did the State simply not increase this capacity in the KwaZulu Police or establish a properly constituted and open above board community guard or reserve guard system?  Why come together with a highly clandestine covert system which is called \"offensive\"?  Now as will become evident, the KwaZulu Police was to be expanded in any event as part of the wider package, so they had another purpose in mind with this clandestine operation.

But the documents are quite clear, they were destined for Inkatha, nowhere else.  Two and a half years later, many were placed into the KwaZulu Police, but for very different reasons, as we will see.  Buthelezi's requests were then placed before the State Security Council at a meeting on the 20th of December 1985 and three Minister, Malan, Le Grange and Heunis were tasked with establishing a security force for Buthelezi.  A sub-structure of the State Security Council was appointed to investigate the implementation of this decision and a sub-committee was drawn, appointed to draw up a detailed report and if one looks under 4.1 at the notes of a member of the sub-committee of the interdepartmental committee, in his handwritten notes he made, he set out who would provide the protective support and there he says Buthelezi and VIP protection.  He attributes that to the South African Police and National Intelligence, the groups that normally supply such protection.  Then he has a heading, \"Inkatha against UDF\" and that is to be supplied by the SADF and DST or the SADF's DST and that I believe is indicative not of protective support to Inkatha, that is offensive.

I'm moving now to the Liebenberg report.  I'll try to deal with it as briefly as I can.  This report was drawn up following an instruction by General Malan to the then Head of the SADF, General Geldenhuys, to draw up a report which would include a detailed implementation plan together with an organogram and Geldenhuys Liebenberg to do so and hence we have the Liebenberg Report.  In the report it's set out that Buthelezi request had already been settled with him, confirmed with him and these included a number of things, personal protection, that of VIPs and so on.  He further required a contra-mobilisation unit for political mobilisation, defensive element and offensive element, intelligence capacity, etcetera.

Funnily enough or interestingly enough, it places the offensive element outside of the paramilitary unit, but this was no coincidence, because the original proposals in fact said that as well and one can refer to the 19th of December 1985 document to see that.  Buthelezi was listed in the organogram as the link person, the only link person between the clandestine support, Inkatha's armed wing and the overt support to the KwaZulu Government structures.

So although we are all aware that Inkatha controlled the KwaZulu Government, for the particular purposes of this project, there was a strict separation between support to the political party, Inkatha, and the support to the homeland government of KwaZulu.

It's referred to in different circumstances.  Here they're talking about the group that goes in to carry out the offensive actions or eliminations, not be used from - not to be used for other purposes such as intelligence gathering and recruitment in case they're arrested.

Under the heading, \"Offensive actions = unlawful actions and the question of legal costs\".  According to a document produced during October 1986, Buthelezi met with DST officers, Cor van Niekerk and John More.  This in fact was the only document provided between June 1986 and January 1988.  Now according to this document, Buthelezi equated offensive actions with unlawful actions and the taking of the law into their own hands.  Now that is quite unambiguous and to claim that offensive actions means one thing in this document but something else in another or all the others, is a claim that I think rings hollow.  So here he was referring to Inkatha members who had taken offensive actions against radical elements and some of these Inkatha men had been arrested and charged and he further purportedly said that although Inkatha had been approached for assistance with legal costs, if money was paid out of party funds, this would come down as - or be seen as a condonation of unlawful actions, a perception which he, as president of Inkatha, could not permit.  Now I know - I am aware that this particular passage is going to be the subject of much debate and will be hotly disputed by my learned friends on that side.  They will argue, of course, that it simply says that because Buthelezi would not approve the paying of legal costs of those charged for carrying out offensive actions out of party funds, because that would be - it will come down as",

It requires in fact the magical expunging of every other reference to offensive and its unlawfulness.  It quite obviously cannot be done.  There was never any suggestion that the offensive capacity requested in 1985 which I have referred to and granted and implemented through to 1989, changed in its essential form.  I shall revisit that particular sentence very briefly at a later stage, given that that particular passage, I'm sure, will be relied upon to paint a virtuous picture of Buthelezi's intentions and his view of offensive actions.  Dealing with the next heading, \"The mysterious year of 1987\".  No documents were made available for this entire year and being the first year of deployment of the Marion members, it would have been one of their most active.  Apart from the carrying out of the Kwa Makutha massacre in January 1987, another example of this activity was the case of the \"Eight Directors\".  Now the Eight Directors were referred to independently by Van Niekerk, who at that time was in charge of Operation Marion and Captain J P Opperman, an instructor at Caprivi and the liaison officer on the ground.

According with Opperman he made arrangements with John More and Cor van Niekerk and money and food were provided to the eight.  They were codenamed the Eight Directors and the group was eventually filtered back into society.  M Z Khumalo himself played a central role, but I'm not going to go into that detail.  Now it is unlikely that the absence of documents for the year of 1987 and the training months in 1986 and other specific documents, like the one I've quoted there and, in fact, we heard from the evidence of Brigadier John More that monthly reports were compiled.  Not a single monthly report was made available.  I don't believe that the absence of these documents was a matter of coincidence or an accident, as in fact claimed by Brigadier Van Niekerk, but according to Van Niekerk he colluded with Colonel Mike van den Berg in removing the documents from the Operation Marion file and for those of you who are not familiar with the background, the story goes that Van Niekerk kept certain documents behind in order to, so he claims, as an insurance policy and that policy related to nothing more than showing that the whole operation was of an entirely innocent nature.

That, I concede, is speculation, but it is not out of the question.  What is clear is that those specific documents were removed.  As I mentioned, I believe that Van Niekerk's claim that he took the documents to show that the project was innocent is a story that he has concocted.  If that was the case the documents could quite easily have been kept for that purpose in MI Headquarters itself and further, they would have been disclosed to nip the controversy in the bud when Goldstone investigators first approached the military and I would argue it is quite obvious that the documents were taken in order to show that the project was properly authorised from the highest level.  That's what an insurance policy is all about.  But, of course, proper authority and lawfulness are not necessarily the same thing, as in this case and others.  Moving to the role of the security branch, the SB supplied key support to Operation Marion.  Its most important function was to ensure that investigations of crimes committed by the paramilitary unit never saw the light of day and assistance was provided in concealing fugitives from justice and investigations were interfered with.

Mbele was instructed in the presence of a senior Inkatha official to take the men to court and have the charges withdrawn and he further said that two members of his investigation team were detained under the emergency regulations without being charged, following the arrest of Ephriam Buthelezi.

            "3B question to be asked is, why, if we are to believe that the project was lawful and protective, was there a need to cover up the crimes of its operatives?  The military were clearly worried and again they referred to putting into practice the aim of Marion to be self-sufficient and independent and to build in cut off points in the interests of security.  And again, this is an important point, Chairperson.  At this stage the military were beginning to get cold feet and this now a theme that runs from now on through to the rest - to the end of the story as evident in the documents, that at the end of the day they couldn't cover up and clean up every single action taken by the operatives on the ground.  Malan then requested a report dealing with the security problems to be put before him by the end of September 1988.  Buthelezi met with Chief of Staff Intelligence, Vice-Admiral Putter on the 14th of September 1988.  Again no documents were made available for this particular meeting, which is again surprising, because if one looks at the documents or the correspondence that has generated from such meetings, there are generally four, five or more memoranda that are prepared, sometimes before and after and it is likely that the security problems arising from the taking of offensive actions were discussed at this meeting and it is further likely that the idea of smaller offensive groups or cells to carry out the offensive actions was raised at this meeting and this will become evident as we look at the documents that flowed after this meeting.

Attempts were secured in the first meeting to get greater police intervention in the cover up of crimes committed by Caprivi trainees.  The Commissioner of Police, Johan van der Merwe explained that they couldn't do much in a pro-active sense, but they gave the following advice that the members concerned must be given bail and then they must simply be taken away.  And that, Chairperson, really I think points to the modus operandi of the Security Forces at the time to intervene and obstruct the course of justice when it was getting close to people involved in such operations.  As a result of this meeting and the somewhat depressing outcome for the military officers concerned, a decision was then taken that somehow they must get these people into the KwaZulu Police and steps were then taken to demobilise the paramilitary unit and most Marion members were ultimately placed into the KwaZulu Police during June 1989 and according to the documents, Buthelezi and Khumalo reported opposed the withdrawal of military support for offensive steps and this is - the security reasons was the reason in fact why these men were placed into the KwaZulu Police some two and a half years later, not because of any plan that was hatched at the outset.

It is hardly surprising that the military have no way of explaining away such crisp references.  It says volumes about the attempts to portray the taking of offensive steps as protective in nature and, under the circumstances, the description of the offensive capacity in the much-vaunted 14th February 1986 document, which talked about preventing attacks on Inkatha members, that document could only have been referring to actions in an initiative-taking or preemptive manner.  Seen in that light, the documents are not contradictory and the same goes for the 16th October document, dealing with Buthelezi's concerns around the paying of legal costs.  If we were to interpret that particular document as Buthelezi would never authorise or tolerate anything unlawful, how do we reconcile that document with this document?

Certainly mobilisation and other support continued.  The documents talk about courses that were supplied - organizational-type courses and so on and so forth, and it's evident that the final meetings with M Z Khumalo were held on the 4th December 1990 - or rather Khumalo was advised on the 4th December 1990 that the operation was being closed down and they met with Khumalo finally on the 23rd January 1991.  General van Tonder himself continued meetings with Buthelezi up until the 16th July 1991.  So, in wrapping up this section of Operation Marion, it was an aim of Operation Marion to supply Inkatha with the capacity of self-sufficiency, and I am now going to argue in the next section that Inkatha's offensive actions continued under the cover of the KwaZulu Police and that the actions of the Esikhaweni hit squad in the early 1990s is a case in point.",

There were two entities which operated  - concern to us (?), the protective and the offensive capacity.  It will no doubt be argued by my learned friends that, in fact, they acted in concert together in hostage and other type situations.  The protective unit would protect and the offensive group would retaliate, as such.  I have already explained how unlikely that was - how impossible.  In any event, in order to seal that particular proposition or rather the incorrectness of it, following the return of the Caprivi trainees to South Africa almost immediately the protective unit was removed and placed into the KwaZulu Police and so not only was their training in offensive and protective techniques quite separate, they didn't act in concert in practice.

It is evident that the actions that flowed out of Operation Marion did not only include criminal offences, such as murder, by necessity, the cover-up of crimes was the order of the day.

Most role-players have chosen to rely on the unlikelihood of an inadequate and overstretched prosecutorial service ever getting its act together to bring thorough and effective prosecutions in such cases.  They rely further on what can be referred to as plausible deniability - what I'd like to call the blind eye syndrome.  This involves placing some distance between the acts on the ground and the decisions taken at the highest levels.  The refrain has often been heard that the highest leaders and officers could not have been expected to know what was going on on the ground and if atrocities did take place this was the work of a few rotten apples.  I believe, however, that this submission has set out a story which reveals an unbreakable and consistent connection between the decisions and strategies decided upon at the level of the State Security Council and higher levels with the explicit references in the documents of operations like Marion, Katzen and others, and with the actions on the ground.  If one is to refer to rot, then it was part of the system itself, which was infected from top to bottom.  I may add that I am somewhat perplexed as to why these role-players continue with their charade.  Apart from the fact that few are persuaded by their denials, all sides adopted strategies which were designed to win the war.  During this war the struggle was seen by all participants as a life and death struggle.  Tactics used by all sides included violence and terror, which resulted in loss of life.  I think few will dispute that the overall aim of all sides to the conflict, apart from their respective political objectives, was to protect their supporters from attack and oppression.  The",

Credibility and statesmanship in these circumstances emerge from being open and honest with the entire nation.  Endeavour to confine culpability to the foot soldiers does a great disservice to these men.  They are passed off as mere thugs and criminals.  They are prevented from coming to terms with their actions.  The spinning of webs of deceit and half truths also does a great disservice to the nation itself as it retards the process of South Africa reconciling itself with its past.  It will, however, not stop this process.  While the acts carried out by members of hit squads, whether they be Caprivi trainees, Vlakplaas members, special forces, or whatever, can only be described as horrific.  They must, however, be seen in context and seen in context they are understandable and I believe that the Truth Commission should see the actions carried out by hit squads in furtherance of a political cause in its proper context.  The bulk of the activities I have described took place within state structures and it security and policing organs.  This culture of impunity and lawlessness still impacts on society today.  Those in public office and in the service of the state should, above all others, comply with the laws of the land.  They should be subject to the greatest scrutiny.

To say that that option 4 in itself was the third force, well, we are still waiting to hear whether, in fact, that was the case or not.  We don't know how far option 4 was taken and you'll read in my report that we say this requires further investigation.  We do note, however, that certain aspects of option 4 were indeed implemented.  For example, they talk of an operations room, and if you scan the State Security Council document you will see an operations room was, in fact, set up at some stage or another, but certainly that would have fed into a co-ordinating structure that may indeed have co-ordinated counter-revolutionary activities.  We suspect that perhaps Minister Vlok was involved in that particular structure, as head of the GBS, and it certainly does fall under the heading, \"Discussions of a third force\".

Our point is that if there was no such third force, and there is no evidence in that regard - Mr Varney has himself said that we don't actually know - then all the evidence which was adduced and all those documents are pro non scriptive.  It means nothing.

The State Security Council didn't establish a statutory body as a third force, separate to the SAP and the SADF.  Now I come along and I use these documents to suggest that there is a third force.

One can hardly use the Malan trial as some sort of basis for saying what type of force it was, whether it existed or not or - it simply dealt with other issues and it dealt with the third force in passing, but I think what we need to do is we need to look",

So this third force, whether it was set up or not - and I concede a separate statutory third force, a separate body to the SAP and SADF, was not set up and I've said so in my report.  If you read it closely you'll see I say that.  I concede it.  But let's look at the wider special capacity of not just the third force itself.  What is the special capacity?  It's defined as follows.  A special capacity specifically organized, equipped and trained to plan, co-ordinate and set up counter-revolutionary actions to fight internal unrest and terrorism.  So that's the broad umbrella under which the special capacity will operate.  And then, of course, they go into those different options.  Let's look at the 12th May meeting itself.

There was certainly discussion about certain options that may end up co-ordinating such actions and even seconding military and special forces people to do specific actions under this co-ordinating body and we don't know whether that was implemented or not and we certainly know that no separate third force was set up, but what I do argue in my paper is that this special counter-revolutionary modus operandi, as such, this is one of the meetings that did send a direction for such actions and if one looks at some of the decisions taken at this meeting the ...

One, of course, is relying on the face of these documents.  Buthelezi himself has not testified, but if one reads the documents and you read the obvious and most simple references to offensive actions, meaning hit squads, to people wanting protection from charges carrying the death penalty, on this one can put a convincing break in between those documents and what was requested.  Then perhaps you may have a point, but I don't see where that connection was broken.  If you look at the very first document, he wants an offensive capacity to strike at the ANC in Lusaka.

There is no manner upon which to be pro-active.  He's not making any guarantees here and his solution is as follows, \"Where a member is in difficulty, bail can be arranged\", and we know that a lot of policemen testified in support of bail applications for Caprivi trainees and others, \"But then the member must be taken away\".  There is no suggestion that the member must be taken away to interfere with the proper investigation.  The member must be taken way in order that he is - he doesn't get detected and caught again and, in fact, the evidence of others who have testified here is that, in fact, that is what happened on a repeated basis.  They got bail and then they simply disappeared.  They were concealed at Mkhuze, at a chief's kraal down the South Coast, and so on and so forth.
