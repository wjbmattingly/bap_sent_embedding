WARSA, it stands for IFP affiliated union.\n On the 28th of September in 1992, we knocked off at five o'clock.  We were on a bus.  We were commuting on a bus from Escort bacon factory, which is in Heidelberg.  We were going to Rutanda.\n As we turned at the corner towards Rutanda, we saw two boys.  They were waiting at a corner.  One of these boys I know, but the other one I didn't know.\n As the bus entered the township, they found that towards the - by the - around the hostel, they had remove the fence.  There were a lot of us in the bus, the bus was full.\n When we realised that the fence had been removed, we saw a fire and the bus was coming.  We realised when we saw this bus was standing there, one of these boys, I saw him pointing and he was pointing at this bus.  As we arrived towards the hostel, we realised that the fence had been removed by the hostel.\n As the bus was approaching, there was something they took out of the fire.  There were a lot of men there.  They were wearing white overalls and red scarfs.  And what they took out of this fire, they had put it under the fire and they pushed it and it was hot.\n They kept on pushing it and as the bus was coming closer and this thing got under the bus and the bus exploded and there was a huge hole, a huge gap inside the bus.\n The driver asked us should I stop or should I proceed?  And other people were already shooting and inside the bus we are burning and we had already been injured.  \n Other people were throwing hand-grenades.  We said, please, don't, stop!  The bus driver turned the bus and pointed it towards the Rutanda cemetery and the police were following us and throwing teargas towards the bus and the bus kept on running and it proceeded in the - behind the street that's near Proti.  So this bus, as it was running away;  there were lots of men.  They followed, they ran behind this bus.  Some of them had sticks.  Others had different kinds of weapons and others were throwing the hand-grenade and the bus driver managed to escape.\n But at the time when he stopped, there was blood flowing from us who had been injured inside the bus.  We were full of blood.  One man, Mr Dadibad and Oman Simango had her legs cut off.\n During at the time when the bus exploded, there were like wounds.  We got injuries and wounds.  Some of the bus metal stabbed us.  Even today I still have got some metal on my feet.  The doctors are not able to remove this shrapnel and metals that got into our legs and the doctors can't remove this.\n And that's the end of my story.",

            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Thank you, Mrs Jokazi.  Can I say that if you feel that you may be intimidated or harassed because of the evidence that you have given us, please do make sure that you contact us, contact our briefer, so that we can actually do something about it. Because part of why we are here is so that people can actually come forward and speak freely and we would not like to feel that in fact your position is worse, because of what you have come today to say before us.\n So if you do run into any problems, please make sure that you keep in contact with us, so that we can actually take the matter up.\n Thank you for coming today and for sharing this with us.  We have heard your request about the metal in your legs and we will certainly pass that on to the Reparation Committee, so that they can actually see if there is any way in which you can be helped almost immediately on your legs.\n We know that it's not easy for you to come and share this story, but we are very glad that in fact you have taken the trouble to do so.  Thank you very much for coming.",
