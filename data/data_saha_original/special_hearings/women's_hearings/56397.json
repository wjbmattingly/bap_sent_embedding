            "In 1986, on the 24th of March, on a Sunday, the time was 20 to three in the afternoon;  we had a meeting of Namagatle Congress.\n When the policemen from Phalaborwa came, and they got us at the meeting, they came to the Lutheran Church where we were holding the meeting and they threw teargas-canisters at us.  Then people started scattering in all directions and ran, but I never ran away.  That's when I was taken and arrested.  When I got there, there was a certain policeman by the name of Mazumba and they arrested the other people.\n At the time they did not take us to the police station to charge us, but they only took us there at 10 to six and they went around the whole location with us and at about 10 to six when they actually put us in the cells, they did not give us food, they did not give us water, they shut the toilets so that we could not go in there to relieve ourselves.\n At night, that particular night, they came and woke us up and they switched off the lights and said we should lie on our stomachs.  They started assaulting us with sjamboks.  At the time we were dressed and they started assaulting us on our buttocks up to the time that our panties were torn and our under-garments were exposed.\n They said we're not going to appear in court and they told lies that when they tried to arrest us, we tried to evade arrests, we jumped fences and that's how we got injured.\n And when they brought us food, they brought us dry pap.  They didn't give us water to wash, they didn't give us water to drink and our clothes were full of blood. They were torn and we appeared in court in that state.\n We asked to be given bail and we were granted bail of R260.00.  And when we went out an attorney took us to doctor Mongeke.  And when Dr Mongeke examined us, he found that we had been assaulted grievously and he said - and they said if we want to see Mandela, we're going to see Mandela on that particular day and that's what they told us.\n There were others who were wearing \"Release Mandela\" \nT-shirts and I was just wearing a dress which was torn, the top part.  We were taken to Dr Mongeke and they escorted us to Dr Mongeke's surgery.\n When we got there, they surrounded the surgery so they said that we wouldn't be able to escape.  Our representative was also present at that time. They did not allow us to go for further treatments, because they were always escorting us. I could not sleep on my side, because of the injury that I sustained when I was gun-butted by one policeman.  \n We went to court for about three times, that was in town and we got into the magistrate's court, he said he couldn't find us guilty.  So we had to be released.\n I wanted to know as to why we weren't being charged and why we were assaulted in the first place.  We were chased outside.  They give us R50,00 each and when we asked as to why we were getting R50,00, they said it was for transport.\n Ever since this took place, I have a problem using my right hand.",
