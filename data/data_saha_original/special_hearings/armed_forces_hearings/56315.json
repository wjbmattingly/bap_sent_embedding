I will restrict myself to one or two issues that are burning at this stage there are many other questions but I understand that this is not the occasion for that at this stage.  General Mortimer on page 49 of your submission you deal with the Civil Cooperation Bureau and you deal with the question of available records and you make the point that no documentation other than contained in the records of the Harms Commission is believed to exist.  Now is that in fact the case?",

Would you be able as the nodal point to facilitate further particulars some more information about this organisation or would you much rather refer the Commission to particular individuals who were in charge of this organisation and for us to deal with in terms of the powers that this Commission has to obtain information.",

There is also a reference to documents that have been destroyed or that have vanished.  Yes the nodal point will further assist as far as it is humanly possible to see if there are any documents available.  I am not talking about documents other than documents in official keeping.  There might be documents available with people that I don't know of.\nDenzil :  Would you be able if that is the case that there are documents with people that don't form part of your officials records, would you be able to direct us to those people.\nKlopper :  If we were to know if we had to come to know of documents in existence with people we would assist the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in finding them.\nDenzil :  Just to make sure that I understand correctly.  This organisation according to your submission here was only terminated in April 1990 and it was finally closed in February 1994, so it seemed to have continued to exist after the Harms Commission so there must have been some official record of existence after the Harms Commission.  Do I understand it correctly?\nKlopper :  The only official documentation that could exist could be on the termination, the administration of the termination.\nDenzil :  Thank you and then perhaps I don't know whether General Mortimer will deal with that.  On page 52 of your submission the last sentence of that paragraph under background where you say that the SADF was pre-eminently a peacekeeping task force but owing to the perceived threat and increasing instability in Southern Africa the SADF strategy was directed at ensuring the security of the people of the RSA by taking offensive pro-active steps.  Now firstly would you be in a position to specify that, give more particulars about the nature of that steps that you are talking about, that's the first point.  Perhaps you want to respond to that eventually perhaps not immediately and then more importantly these offensive pro-active steps did that ever amount to operations inside the country within the borders of the RSA.",

Those are the examples we have found by studying existing documentation.  At this stage from studying existing documentation we have not identified such operations internally.  However as I tried to indicate that documentation is not necessarily all available at a central point at this stage.  One would have to identify potential or possible operations.  Identify the area in which they took place and then try to trace it according to the level and the place where it occurred.  As I say from our studies at this stage, no.\nDenzil :  And then just in conclusion is that what you mean on page 61 where you say that the list of operations as is set out here may not be complete, so you may be able to come across some more operations as you do your work as the nodal point.",

It's very broad based and the time available is not necessary as thorough as it should be and so yes.\nDenzil :  Thank you very much, thank you chairperson.\nBoraine :  Thank you, Wildschut.\nWildschut :  General Mortimer my question is related to the comments my colleagues made about the narrative or descriptive nature of your presentation.  I would like you to perhaps just take us through the process a little bit, perhaps just in a few sentences.  Tell us why the nodal point and persons involved in the collation of this information decided or got to the point that this submission would be purely descriptive.  Why was the decision made that it would be just a narrative without some interpretation at least.  So take us through that process a little bit and also could you tell us if there are inferences that we should be drawing from this?  What do you want the nation to know in this public submission about the work of the SADF and what kind of inference should we be drawing from this submission.",

            "The principal problem with interpretation is that we have no authority to speak on behalf of the SADF.  There is no commander of the SADF to give me an order, do the task and interpret, give me your opinion.  If I was to interpret this then former members of the SADF would be entitled and they have already done so said you do not have my authority to speak on my behalf.  You Mortimer can go and stand there and speak but you do not speak on my behalf.  Therefore I cannot interpret because then I would be taking rights to judge other people's actions which they do not want me to do.  That is the principal reason.  What do we want people to think about about our presentation.  I think principally we want people to think that we were a professional force that as professionals soldiers we had certain responsibilities to the State.  The responsibilities that are not only written in law but are part of a professional ethic.  The professional ethic says that you must give the government of the say your loyalty.  If you cannot live with their policies then you must resign.  If you can live with their policies even if you don't agree with them in all detail it is your responsibility to give the government your honest advice and so too the soldier must give his commander his honest advice.  That staff officer who gives advice to the commander must give what he believes not what he thinks the commander wishes to hear.  However the ethic goes further.  Once the commander has made the decision even if the decision goes against your advice then it is your absolute professional duty to carry out his decision to the very best of your ability.  I think we would like to tell the nation that we did that.  We had the question did we never disagree.  We did disagree but working on the professional ethic having disagreed once your commander has made a decision then you must carry out his decision.\nWildschut :  Thank you for that insight.  I think that's the kind of insight that we would really like to have.  My second question is related to the issue, I may have missed it in the submission, which may not have been alluded to or mentioned and that's the issue of chemical and biological warfare.  Has there any been plans in relation to such warfare, and perhaps eventually as my other colleagues have mentioned it might be something that you would like to tell us about.  Could you tell us if there was such strategies?",

We were relatively sure that chemical weapons had been used on occasion by the enemy in Angola and therefore we studied it defensively.  We have not addressed the Angolan situation in this paper.  So, yes there was study of chemical and biological warfare and we have not come across any information indicating investigations in chemical and biological warfare for offensive purposes on the part of the SADF but I wouldn't like to say that it would be futile for you to question, it might produce something but I certainly cannot at this stage give you any assurance that there will be anything available.\nBoraine :  General Mortimer as you know I made a couple of preliminary remarks, I'd now like to follow that up with quite specific questions.  On page 50 part 3 paragraph 11 c2 you refer to clients.  I'd wonder if you could help us by telling us who were the clients of the directorate of covert collections.",

            "Well, firstly of course the SADF as a whole.  Should an operation be planned at the chief of the defence force level then he would be the principal client.  Should an operation be planned at army level then the intelligence available to the chief of the defence force would be made available to the chief of the army either on the request of the chief of the army but also almost as an automatic action that you push your intelligence down to your lower level.  If I could now skip the command level and say an operation is planned at group level, group could be conceivably a client of covert collection but it would now have to go up the whole channel of command so group would request information or intelligence from command who would request from army headquarters who could then eventually request it.  So really theoretically at any rate any person who has to carry out an operation somewhere in this organisation could request intelligence and could in that sense be applied.  It is however might more likely that it would be the higher headquarters who would be the client.",

In fact it was lied to, that's general facts, I am not asking you to accept it, just saying that for the argument accept that because this has now been well established.  I just happened to be there at the time, I know what was told to me and what actually was happening at the very time it was told to me by the then Minister of Defence.
