            "If the photographers and those who are filming would now begin to end please, so that we can make a start.  I think we've been fairly generous with our time.  I thank you very much for your co-operation, I appreciate that.  I would like to extend a very warm word of welcome to all who are present at this hearing today, in particular I'd like to welcome General Meiring of the SANDF and General Viljoen, who will be making a presentation very soon - former head of the SADF and will be speaking specifically on that area and the past.\n Several others will also be participating in the hearing and to all of you, we are grateful and appreciative of your co-operation.  It is our hope that we are going to have a very productive day, a day where we hear each other, where we assemble information which is demanded of the Commission by our founding act.  And that is all we are looking forward to receiving.  In particular we are anxious to know the perceptions and the motivations, the planning throughout the period of conflict.  We have asked exactly the same questions of other key role players in that conflict and will continue to do so during the course of this week.\n Yesterday for example, we listened to the APLA commanders, former APLA commanders and members of the PAC, tomorrow we will have representation from the former South African police and on Friday, former leaders of MK so that throughout the week we'll be trying to assemble a picture which will assist us in making our final report to President Mandela and of course to Parliament, which is demanded of us.\n I would like to introduce the panel.  On my right is Ms Hlengiwe Mkhize who is Chairperson of our Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee and a Commissioner who resides normally in Gauteng but like all of us travels extensively around the country.  On my far left is Mr Ilan Lax from Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu Natal, based in Durban who is a Committee member and a member of our Human Rights Violations Committee and has joined the panel for these two days.  On my immediate left is Mr Dumisa Ntsebeza who is head of our investigative unit, a Commission based in Cape Town.  My name is Alex Boraine, I'm acting Chairperson of the Commission.  Archbishop Tutu is outside of the country at the moment and will be returning only at the weekend.  \n I would like to also welcome members of the media without whom our work would be far less we think, particularly in terms of involving not only those who are here today, but so many people across the nation, both in terms of radio coverage, in terms of TV and the print media.  I'd like to say a special word of welcome to the interpreters, I think we forget sometimes the huge and excellent job that they do.  And whilst I'm talking about them, may I remind you that translation is available in English Afrikaans and Xhosa, so hand set are available - headsets are available.  \n I hope you won't take them away with you, they will be of no help to you outside of this building but please make use of this if they become necessary for you.   And just a more frivolous announcement, I'd be grateful if all cell phones including General Meiring's, can now be switched off.  I have switched mine of and I'm sure everybody will do that.  We will adjourn for tea but we'll be slightly flexible to see what progress we've made, but approximately around half past 10 and then we will adjourn for lunch at 1 o'clock.  And we hope to conclude - and we'll be grateful for your co-operation, to conclude around about 4 o'clock because of other commitments, both by the panel and indeed by those who are with us today.\n I'm going to invite now General Viljoen to make a presentation but I'm not sure if General Meiring - yes, General Meiring you have the floor, if you'll just press the red button.",

            "Thank you.  Honourable Chairperson and Commissioners, due to the criticism of the first submission made by the former South African defence force and after correspondence with Doctor Boraine of the Commission, it was decided that a second submission was necessary.  As Chief of the South African National defence force, I've facilitated this by calling up a group of retired members of the former South African defence force to prepare this submission.\n This in itself was problematic Sir, as many former members do not wish to become involved due to an inherent distrust of the TRC.  It should also be borne in mind that not everything which occurred in the past was documented.  It was thus necessary to rely largely on the memory of these former members.  I've corresponded on numerous occasions with the TRC through Doctor Boraine, requesting that the TRC provided us with an indication of those issues which the Commission would like us to address in the second submission.  \n There was no active material response to these requests, all we received were the documents attached to the Section 29 and Section 13 notices which naturally made our preparations that much more difficult.  And led not only our being in a position to present this document only today.  Due to the time restrictions which you have placed on the presentation, it is assumed that further questions arise from this.  I undertake as far as possible Sir to answer these questions within 39 days of receipt if there are any elaborate questions concerning this.\n Chairperson, I request you to read this submission not in isolation, it should be read in conjunction with the first submission which was made as well as the numerous answers posed to the questions after the hearing of the first submission.  In effect those three elements, the submission today and the first submission and the answers to the questions, questions and answers, make up the entire submission of the former SADF.\n The new submission has been prepared in co-operation with the four previous chiefs of the South African defence force and I'm honoured to have three of my predecessors here today.  Unfortunately General Malan is not able to attend, due to being overseas at the present moment in time.  For your information Sirs, the following are the terms of office of my predecessors:\nGeneral Malan, from 1976 to 1980\nGeneral Viljoen, from 1980 to 1985\nGeneral Geldenhuys, from 1985 to 1990\nGeneral Liebenberg, from 1990 to 1993\nMy own term as Chief of the South African defence force was from November '93 to April '94, whereupon in May '94, I was given the job of being the Chief of the South African National defence force.\n It's now my pleasure to hand over to General Viljoen, who will present the South African Defence Force submission.  So, I thank you and ask to be excused for a few minutes and I'll be back again, thank you very much.",

            "Mr Chairman, I would like to start by saying that my status today is the following\n After having completed the first submission, we decided on a higher level - this first submission was done by Mortimer, we decided to become involved and my colleagues asked me to present them here today for specific reasons.  I'm the oldest here today and they all served under me but a very important reason is that I was involved in the development of the strategy of the South African defence force and was involved in cross-border operations in Southern Africa.  And probably I'm the best suited to talk about this very important matter.  \n I've taken an oath to speak the truth and I will do just that.  I will refer to the matter that it had been a long time ago, it's a very broad scope, many things had happened, I consulted widely, I consulted with my colleagues because I'm going to make remarks on certain period after I've retired.  My colleagues are all present here and I've asked them - should I make any mistake in my presentation, they should bring it under my attention but I will remind you that it was a very big organisation, it stretched over a long period and many things happened.\n Regarding this document, it's a very huge thick document and I did not provide it to you or the press because I am not going to talk according to a specific order, I'm going to jump to and fro because I can't address this whole thick document.  I want to suggest that you could rather study the document at a later stage and rather listen to what I am saying.  The scope of my presentation will firstly be to make a few introductory remarks.  \n Immediately afterwards I will pay attention to the third force activities, then to the Steyn Report, then I will come back to Chapter one of the thick document in which I want to address the fundamental matter of the perceptions and motives of the defence force.  And I would like to assist you because you have a very important task without having military background and I want to put it as simplistic as possible then.\n In Chapter one, I want to discuss the context, the strategic context discussion of trans-border or cross-border operations and South African defence force involvement in the South African theatre.   I wish to start then by certain introductory remarks.  The purpose of our submission is to assist the Commission in it's investigation regarding gross violations of human rights.  It is not our purpose today to use this time to criticise the other side against whom we acted and to put ourselves in a better light.\n Today we wish to assist you in your task because we have reason to believe that we can make a contribution to provide a more balanced final report in the end.  A one-sided report will harm reconciliation and will do no good to our predecessors if this is not placed in the right perspective.  This is why we wish to assist you in this regard, not only today but even when you write the report and need further assistance.\n Our collective group, the old South African defence force - we still have strong ties.  The solidarity and ...[inaudible] which you find a defence force can't vanish overnight when it's changed into a new defence force, therefore we as commanders are dissatisfied especially under old members, people who served in a dedicated way and tried to follow a career in a dedicated way.  It's in the interest of our country that this feeling will not run out of control and this is why we wish to provide better perspective to the Commission.  Many lies are told in this process which is rather a process to tell the truth and wrong perceptions are created.  \n The first submission made by the ...[inaudible] of the defence force was criticised by many of your Commissioners, even you yourself.  We realise that there was prejudice and there were also main articles written in newspapers in this regard.  We tried out utmost best from that time up till now to find what your needs are and to determine what we should submit to be complete.  We've written a lot of letters to you, you did not answer these letters and we still do not know what exactly you expect from us.  In August, we took the initiative to say - and in August that in the interest of - in the national interest and in the interest of the army, we will make the presentation.  \n A few days before this presentation, it was cancelled and this was followed by this process for which we were subpoenaed.  This submission which is important for your task - we still want to present that.  It is clear to us that none of the Commissioners have an insight in military operations.   In the first instance or the first submission, we perhaps made a mistake using military terminology and that is why we want to assist you.  And we request that you will treat us fairly and that will be the path to reconciliation and peace.  That is just as important for us as for any other political party.\n One of the problems which became clear during the previous presentation was that there's a difference in political culture.  The previous defence force was politically neutral while the Commissioner and our previous political opponents were politically highly motivated.  Our first submission was clean from politics with the exception of General Magnus Malan who was a previous minister.  This problem was ...[inaudible] that no political party handled the interest of the previous defence force.  The previous Government, they did not support the interest of the previous defence force. \n General Malan was the most senior member and I'm nearest the active politics and I'm assuming responsibility to talk here today, not as a politician but as a former head of the defence force and I've given this undertaking to my former colleagues.  In the first place, I request the Commission to try and understand the reluctance which there against the previous defence force, it comes from our ...[inaudible] - we served the former State with effectiveness.  During this transition period we also served effectively.  \n After '94, this same group formed a core to handle the assimilation of the other security forces into the army.  This we also did with dedication.  This dedication and effectiveness came from the patriotism which we felt for South African and from our professional approach to the noble task of a soldier in uniform.  If we look to the previous constitutional dispensation, I would just like to make a few remarks.  The previous defence force served the sovereign State with a legal Government and not political parties.  \n The State's international defence was handled by us and the State's obligation to act according to it's mandate to protect the people and also to protect South Africa in this regard.   Our internal behaviours was according to the previous constitution of South Africa.  The old defence force was during the previous dispensation, a builder of bridges - I'm sorry, I've omitted one paragraph.  The old defence force strived to - in a practical way politically and on a racial basis, to incorporate everybody into the defence force.  We've developed a defence force from the nation.\n It was under difficult circumstances when the political policy of the past made it difficult and the defence force's acceptability was not good but we achieved some success.  During the previous dispensation, the defence force was a builder of bridge who promoted good relationships between all peoples in the country.  This approach corresponds with our strategy would not have been possible.  The old defence force, due to it's professional approach served the Government of the day without fear and even acted outside our mandate to inform the cabinet about the necessity for making political adjustments for the sake of peace.\n We often and honestly warned that the defence force operations were only gaining to time to achieve political stability.  Then there was a change of Government in a very dramatic way, the defence force still kept on acting professionally.  If there was any complaint against the defence force, it was that it was so effective that the politicians gained a false sense of security instead of realising the necessity for political change and to retard this political change.  The eventual stability during the political negotiations must be due to the effectiveness and loyalty of the old defence force.\n It remains an open question whether the opposing military forces would have worked out better peace time proposals than the politicians did.  As an old defence force and if MK and other forces opposing us, it seems as if we're finding it easier to establish reconciliation as we can in the political sphere.  Despite the virtually faultless service of the defence force and during the transition period, it did not avoid political suspicion.  We as representatives of that organisation feel alienated by what we consider to be the unjustified hostility of the Government and organisations against us.\n Firstly, the previous Government, when a new dispensation started becoming possible and which served the Government of the day was ignored and at the same time the previous Government - without any valid reasons, started discrediting the old defence force.  One example was the Steyn Report which I will deal with later.  An incredible list of allegations were investigated, assassinations, destabilisation, train murders, gun running, illegal training, manipulation of the negotiation processes and general criminal activities were some of these allegations in this report.\n A police investigation by three senior policemen and various internal investigations were undertaken and even 5 years after, no proof could be found of any of these allegations and no legal steps have been taken to substantiate these.  Yet the previous defence force - Government allowed the services of 23 of our colleagues to be ended.  This incident and additional to the other untested evidence of third force activities contributed to discredit this highly regarded organisation of ours.  We regard these as scurrilous allegations.  \n These attacks were followed by you Mr Chairman of the TRC.  Just after the first submission you - I want to quote from the media:\nYou referred to the SADF as our military machine.\nWe were not this and we were not the military wing of the National Party.  \n\"This submission flies in the face of facts\".\nWe don't know which facts you refer to.  This hurt us very deeply because it created the impression that we have distorted the facts and that is not our intention.  You used the words:\n\"It was breathtakingly one-sided and audacious in it's failure to acknowledge culpability\"\nYou also used the words:\n\"That that defence force, thank God, no longer exists\"\n We want to ask you that this - we want to tell you that this creates a perception of our organisation and that we are not being trusted, that we are not being honest in our actions.  Apart from this, the decision to hold the Kwamakuta trial in Durban brought further discrediting of the defence force.  Various previous heads of the defence force and other officers were humiliated for more than a year.  All of them were found not guilty but the discrediting of the old defence force continued.  During this incident a lot of pressure was applied to me personally from Government circles to convince these accused to change this whole trial from a judicial trial to a TRC trial.  They did not accept this because they said they were not guilty and they wanted to prove it in court.  \n A year after the finding, the TRC have again tried to do that which could not be proved in court - to prove it with untested evidence here.  These incidents, especially in the absence of investigations into other parties, which creates the impression of a witch-hunt.  That the new Government is allowing this is also proof of antagonism at Government level against the old defence force which served the country so loyally and of which most of the members are still the most important part of the new defence force.\n We will work with the new stated aims of the TRC.  We are also interested in putting the past behind us.  We want to assist with gaining better insight but not in the sense of persecution.  We don't want to be used as a group for propaganda purposes and to be victimised.  We don't say that we're the angels of the past, what I do want to say is that we as the former defence force believed with integrity and our knowledge of this sort of war, of which many case studies were studied to find the best methods.  We discovered that it was all about the hearts and minds of the people and therefore these violations of human rights would have been contrary to our aims.  Therefore, we deliberately avoided these and trained our forces accordingly because the battle was about the hearts and minds, there was a lot of propaganda on both sides and this propaganda is aimed at changing people's perceptions.  It changes facts to achieve it's purposes and all these accusations against the old defence force is an example of this sort of propaganda.  \n What I want to point out is that the nature of the operations of the old defence force were determined by the strategic actions of our erstwhile enemies.  We referred to the ANC's strategy which was instituted after visits to Vietnam. The ANC then looked for, developed and recommended a strategy:\n\"The combination of a political and military struggle, the mobilisation of the whole of the people to fight the army, the unity of the internal situation and the international solidarity and the party's leadership role over the armed forces\"\n The underground ANC actions led to various results such as the isolation of South Africa.  With some exceptions the politicians showed little appreciation of these elements and it was in fact the old SADF which played a leading role in developing this security service of the State - you must adapt or you must die.  The State security system also poses questions which we will try to answer.  We say that the old SADF did not act without authorisation, it always acted with the sanction of the Government.  The strategic sterility of the previous dispensation drew the defence force closer to the political centre of things but this was only to oppose the revolution.  \n It was therefore the ANC which devised the international role of this battle, this struggle.  There was involvement with the USSR and the use of neighbouring countries basis and this also led to joint operations with other countries against this tendency.  The TRC cannot give international amnesty for cross-border operations, so there's general agreement that cross-border operations and the details of these cannot form part of this amnesty process.\n Regarding your investigations, it is very risky to investigate these cross-border operations but to help you to extend or expand your report, we would like to explain how in theoretical terms, the SADF conducted it's operations.  Our legal advice is not to get involved in the details of cross-border operations.  I saw the Minister of Justice, Mr Omar and I approached you and Bishop Tutu and nobody could supply a solution to this dilemma.   I fixed your attention on the negative factors which are unproductively acting on us.\n Now, the rest of the presentation will deal with several subjects which will answer some of the questions that you have put.  We hope sincerely that the misperceptions about the SADF and it's operations will be cleared up and we are pleased to be able to help in this.  I want to say a few words to draw a conclusion - I'll do this in English.   To sum up, let me put the following submissions on the table Mr Chairman.\n The intention of our defence force in Southern Africa and South Africa, was just in that it was to maintain peace for the sake of a peaceful negotiated settlement under stable conditions.  The force that we used was well trained and well disciplined and we were justly proud of this force.  \n Secondly, all our actions served the purposes of the international self-defence, mainly against Soviet expansionism and the maintenance of internal order.  \n Thirdly, the proportionality of force that we applied was always in accordance with what was the minimum needed for the self-defence of our State or for the maintenance of internal disorder.  \n Fourthly, we are satisfied that in the context of the cold-war situation, force was the only resort as both sides politically were not initially politically prepared to negotiate.  Ever since 1975, we the SADF advised the then Government to explore other solutions too.\n Fifthly, the production of non-...[inaudible] has always been respected by us.  We were faced with the most difficult situation when the war was taken to the \"human bush\" by our opponents, using them as human shields.\n Sixth, the conflict ended in a negotiated settlement, there was no military victory nor a military defeat.  The constitutional accord which followed we all should respect, states on national unity of reconciliation that there should be understanding, not revenge, reparation, not retaliation, ...[inaudible] victimisation.  For this Chairperson, we will settle and be part but not for less.  The SADF was the legal instrument of a legal Government.\n Seventh, we specifically request that your report should be fair and even handed.  For this reason we offer our co-operation and offer to give further assistance if you require some to put our part in the conflict for your sake, in the right perspective.  As former leaders Chairperson, we accept the moral responsibility for the conduct of our subordinates in the execution of our command.  That by means of the preliminary remarks by way of introduction.\n Chairperson, I now wish to switch over to the important aspect of the accusations of a third force.  There was a general concept of a third force and in our position today there are actually two concepts applicable.   Firstly we have the tuitional concept of a third force being the kind of force running parallel between the SAP and the South African defence force.  In other words, it's a third force much the same as you have in Italy of the Carabanarian.  \n Now the Oxford dictionary defines a third force as a political group or a party acting as a check-on between two opposing parties.  A specialised force - it's a specialist force parallel to the police force and defence force with para-military functions, specifically organised, equipped and trained to plan, co-ordinate and execute counter-revolutionary actions and to quell civilian riots and to combat internal terrorism.\n Chairperson, the SADF's disposition towards this third force is very clear.  There was on 4 November 1985 - four days after my retirement, the State Security Council issued an instruction to a working committee to launch an investigation into a possible establishment of a third force.  And I can understand because I could remember in the last months of my service, I could remember the problem of the internal situation building up.  And I can recall that the SADF was not really looking forward to this and I think the South African police also had the problems of dealing with this because they had their own normal police functions to carry out.\n And there was a discussion as to whether a third force to deal with the internal situation to take over from the police, to take over from the defence force, whether that would be necessary.  So this commission was established and eventually it reported back on the 8th of May 1986 and the commissioner of the then SAP informed a committee of the State Security Council that it was not feasible to establish a third force because of legal and financial implications.\n The Vlok Committee consequently recommended that a third force should not be established but that the capabilities of the South African police should be expanded to cope with the internal situation because that was the prime responsibility of the South African police.  So the third force in that sense of running parallel between the defence and the police was never established but there had been some discussions in this regard.\n I think it was the discussion in this regard that eventually led to the discussion of the other kind of third force that will be available.  There is apparently another commendation attached to the idea of a third force, that is when perpetrators to incidents of violence, murders and atrocities, cannot be identified or traced and it is suspected that such perpetrators or organised, managed and employed to promote hidden and sinister objectives to the benefit of organisations that handle them.  \n I want to refer to Commissioner Listner in the Kwamakuta investigations, actually came to the conclusion that the third force of which the accusations were made was not part of a third force that was considered by the State Security Council for implementation, as a parallel force between the police and the defence force.  So regarding the other kind of force, I can say that there is no indication whatsoever of any official sanction for actions within the defence force in line with this paragraph 12, that is sinister actions of operations.  It was certainly not sanctioned at any level and I can say that categorically for my period and I've also consulted with my successors and they have also given me the assurance that there is no such force.\n Can we now turn over to the Steyn Report and the Steyn Report was actually a report which started off as the main accusation against the idea of this sinister kind of third force that people suspected, or the people thought that we were guilty of.  I am aware that this Commission has had discussions with the Steyn Report, so I assume that it will not be necessary to read out again all the details but it is well known that Lieutenant General Steyn was appointed to conduct an investigation.  \n This was the result of certain indications from within the defence force - the counter-intelligence within the defence force, became aware of certain actions of certain actions of the ...[inaudible] collection that might have involved criminal or other dubious activities.  They then reported it as just a function of counter-intelligence to make such a report but another organisation, the National Intelligence Service which had the responsibility for analysing the political spectrum and regular briefing to the State President, they also carried their own investigations in this regard.\n This National Intelligence Service was of opinion that the South African defence force could stage a coup if the negotiations went the wrong way.  This opinion was conveyed to both the Government and members of foreign intelligence agencies.  The NIS also conducted it's own investigations into the activity of the directorate of ...[inaudible] collection.  The South African defence force's role in the national management system has already been substantially reduced by their - at this stage and in the light of the views expressed by the NIS, National Intelligence Service, the perception seems to have been created in Government circles that the South African defence force could not be trusted.\n It is believe that this was discussed at cabinet level too.  So that led to the Steyn appointment and this followed after the 16 November '92 raid by the Judge Goldstone Commission of the ...[inaudible] office in Pretoria and they thought that they had now discovered the heart of third force activities in South Africa.  Lieutenant General Steyn made use of the information of the investigations internally within the defence force and also the National Intelligence, what they were prepared to give to General Steyn.\n Available information indicates that Steyn's various reports rely heavily on NIS material and not on the internal material of the defence force.  Allegations in the Steyn Report alleged that various elements of the South African defence force were involved in the planning and the execution of such acts as - and I mention them all, assassinations, inter-organisational conflict, ...[inaudible], train massacres, discrediting - I've mentioned the lot of them.  \n The important aspect of the Boipatong massacre - a terrible incident, destabilisation of internal and external situations, stockpiling of arms abroad, training of resistance movements, internal military training, arms smuggling, manipulation of the negotiation process, setting up CCB type of organisations as a resistance movement, involvement in right-wing activities, chemical and biological warfare programmes and general criminal activities.  A formidable accusation of which many of them were on the ideas of the third force accusations.\n Then General Conradie of the police investigated this and he went through 200 files at the Directorate of Covert Collection.  Their conclusions - Brigadier Blignaut and Lieutenant General Conradie, was no illegal activities had taken place, the methods of the handlers and the performers were professional, DCC was well structured and no evidence of hidden agendas, there was an overlap in domestic intelligence collecting functions, there was no evidence that the DCC was operating outside it's line function, all evidence indicated that the DCC personnel were engaged in their professional tasks.\n There was a briefing then of the State President after General Conradie's Report had become available but apparently the General Conradie Report was not submitted.  General Steyn then briefed the State President using the unconfirmed information from NIS and NID investigations.  Media reports indicated that he reported the following:  \n Firstly, definite signs of a third force activity or an unofficial revival of the CCB.\n Secondly, a number of individuals within the structures investigated had an influence to the top management - on the top management of the SADF, thus by implication the South African defence force could be construed as being involved in the creation of violence and intimidation.\n Thirdly, there was a need for encompassing action at all levels including the top, personnel should be dismissed, strong control should be instituted and where possible court action should be instituted.  He recommended that Generals Liebenberg, Meiring and CP van der Westhuizen be confronted for various misdeeds and that they be requested to take early retirement or be forced to do so if necessary.  He recommended simple action or prosecutions should be applied to sub-ordinates within this organisation.  He recommended also new appointments which should be made and new operational and financial control procedures to be instituted.\n General Steyn also recommended that some issues be referred to the South African police, the Attorney General, the Auditor General and the Goldstone Commission.  In January '93, the documents used for the briefing were handed over to the Attorney General of the Transvaal and to date, no prosecution has been pursued.  In the meantime we had the dismissal of 23 of our colleagues.  In General Steyn's opinion the revelations had caused an embarrassing problem to both the defence force and the State.  A decision was thus taken to purify the SADF, apparently before the cabinet was briefed. \n General Liebenberg was produced with a list and told to select the names of personnel against whom immediate action should be taken in the light of the Steyn documentation.  General Meiring and van der Westhuizen assisted in this selection.  General Steyn also sat at the first meeting in this connection.  In the meantime Mr Roelf Meyer who was then a Minister, was in the United States on an official visit and he apparently phoned the State President on two occasions and probably emphasised the United States requirement to see the State President acting forcefully.\n The names selected were presented and negotiations took place on the dismissal of these people - the early retirement of these people and others were placed n compulsory leave.  General Liebenberg was given one week to advise the personnel concerned but on arriving back in his office the news had already been broken in the media.  Apparently it was leaked in the United States.  The following investigations were also conducted in pursuance to the Steyn Report:  the SA police and the Attorneys General, the finding of which indicated that there was not a shred of evidence that could be found.  \n Although requested on various occasions by various people, the NIS, National Intelligence Services were not in a position to provide any further information or they refused to make available their sources.  By the ...[inaudible] Committee to investigate and the re-appointment of CCB members which cleared DCC of all allegations.  The ...[inaudible] Committee oversaw the termination of the DCC front companies and the restructuring of the DCC.  \n And then there was a Gleeson Board of Enquiry appointed, also to investigate the allegations against certain individuals.  This board was terminated because of the pending investigation by the Attorney General of the Transvaal.  So Lieutenant General Steyn persisted with his own corroborated allegations and suggested to the Minister of Defence that the Goldstone Commission investigate allegations in connection with taxi and train killings.  Following this the SAP spent 14 days of intensive investigation at 5 Reconnaissance Regiment, allegedly one of the main perpetrators but could find no evidence that the unit had been involved in instigating violence.\n We have a doubt about the role of National Intelligence Services in this regard.  In October '92, Judge Goldstone raised his concern about the role of the National Intelligence Services, with the State President.  The Commission only had access to two MID source documents dealing with alleged criminal activities.  The allegations relating to the involvement in violence, the train violence, the IFB violence etc., emanated mainly from the National Intelligence Services and the Goldstone Commission had failed to obtain access to their source documents despite the seriousness of the allegations.  The National Intelligence Services could thus not substantiate them.\n Further developments - a senior officer in the group whose services had been terminated, wrote to the State President requesting a court martial to clarify the aspects on which was being accused in this whole case but despite several reminders he received no reply whatsoever.  In addition, civil applications were instituted by three individuals in connection with their dismissals - all these cases were settled out of court by the payment of relatively large sums of money to the applicants and their names were cleared.\n In conclusion, no written report by General Steyn could be found.  He appeared to have made use of unconfirmed and uncorroborated allegations supplied by NIS and MID, the counter-intelligence of the defence force themselves.  General Steyn did appear before your Commission - we tried to get a report from your Commission but it was impossible, so we are not informed about anymore information that might have come to your knowledge in this regard.  \n I have made this report on this situation but there are now a number of unanswered questions.  Firstly, in this briefing of the State President, General Steyn suggested a further investigation because none of the allegations had been confirmed, yet the State President went ahead with his action.  The question is, why?\n The Conradie Report, secondly, was available before the briefing of the State President, yet not mention was made of it's findings - why?  The rules of natural justice state that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, yet these were not followed - why?  Much of the information used in the decision to terminate the services of the 23 officers emanated from the National Intelligence Services who could or would not substantiate it or disclose their sources, yet it was acted upon the to the detriment of 23 of our colleagues.\n Now some 5 years later after numerous investigations - I think this case has been over-investigated, no prosecutions have taken place, no concrete evidence has come to light.  It seems the major role players and the 23 officers were the victims of actions based on unsubstantiated reports and rumours, more likely emanating from dubious perceptions that from hard realities.  It appears from an objective evaluation that the conduct of dismissal of the officers concerned was arbitrary and arose from a subjective perspective.  Whatever the motives of the main role-players, the facts appear to indicate that a gross injustice had taken place.  In fact I think if ever there is something possible such as a gross violation on the damage or the violence supplied to the minds of people, it must have been to these 23 officers and I know most of them personally and I was completely taken by surprise when I learnt from the press what had happened to these people.\n Chairperson, this has been the main accusation of the third force activities and this has been as I said, over investigated and there is no substantiation of such an allegation.  I realised that there are some thoughts regarding the idea of  false flag operations and that the false flag operations could be coupled with the idea of the third force activities.  \n If you consider the way in which our opponents operated within the townships - they also operated in civilian clothes, they also pretended to be civilians, I would say that must also be a false flag.  So, if we operated in civilian clothes too, it cannot be regarded as a false flag type of operation but I end off by saying that we categorically deny that this kind of allegation has been part of our policy within the defence force.\n Chairperson, I would like now to switch back to document 1 of the document here and that is the development of the South African National and Defence strategies.  The background of these external operations of external involvement, the background of the internal strategies that now developed, we think are aspects of great importance to the Commission when you have to write your report regarding what happened in the past.\n I'm sorry that I will not be able to deal with this in all the detail that I would have like to because of the time limit but I still regard it as very, very important.  In dealing with the South African National Defence from 1960 onwards, it is necessary to place the development of the military conflict in Southern Africa during that time, into the right historical context so as to review the motives and perceptions for military activities in the proper perspective.\n Politicians of the previous Government and senior officers of the South African defence force often publicly referred to a term: \"total onslaught\".  This term comes actually from Andre Bufre who is a French strategist and the terms used to describe the situations that existed at that time.  The term: \"total onslaught\" actually contains two sub-terms: \"total war\" and  \"revolutionary war\" and this is actually in my opinion, the essence of the conflict of the past.\n Let me first deal with the concept of the: \"total war\".  We had the first and the second world wars.  Wars are good examples of total conventional war,  total in the sense of involving just about the entire population of the entire economical activities of a country such as Germany, such as the UK and total in the respect of great violence being applied in trying to coerce the opposing group to surrender.\n I would like to refer to the strategic bombing offensives that was taken in these wars, from Germans on to the UK and from the UK on to the Germany side of it.  And also towards the final developments in the second world war when we had the application of nuclear power in the battlefield.  The strategic bombings as well as the nuclear power application, led to heavy loss of civilian life.  \n Further characteristics of these kinds of war as they developed was that of the psychological operations which was a new introduction to war. These operations were aimed at encouraging the one side's population and the forces and discouraging those of your enemy.  This resulted in dislike and hatred of the enemy and this was the inevitable result also in the case of our own conflict.  \n Another feature of: \"total war\" was that military resources were often used for the purposes other than primary aims, for example the air bombardment to effect economic warfare to destroy the armaments productions capability of a place such as Germany.  Objectives such as the destruction of industry and for psychological objectives such as the destruction of civilian moral.  So war has always been - in the last two world wars, also very much directed against civilian populations too.  \n \"Total war\" can be defined as a conflict in which political, military, economic and psychological resources of at least one belligerent State are fully engaged and the survival of one or more of the belligerent States is at stake.  For South Africa it is well known that we had in this conflict, political, military, psychological and economic factors ever since we started the war in 1960.  So that is the concept of the idea of: \"total war\" as it developed in the second and the first world wars.\n Now the: \"revolutionary war\".  I think one must accept the fact that there was a total rejection within the feeling of especially the Western world but I think in mankind, that the destruction of civilians and the number of casualties, considering the destructiveness of nuclear weapons was a fact no longer acceptable to mankind.  And therefore we had new kinds of war developing especially after the second world war.\n One of those revolutionary wars - and this became the major form of conflict in the post-world war two period, can be described as a modern adaptation of total war with progressive application of political, that's ideological, economic, for example sanctions, psychological, the application of the factors of fear, allegiance etc.  And those were combined with varying degrees of military action and violence.  Military action and violence in our case for example, mass action, intimidation, bombs, mines and attacks.\n Basically \"revolutionary war\" is the pursuit of the policy of a politically inspired and organised group in the country, by all means available, also by outside support and the success is obtained by the creation of a situation of instability inside the country and political intolerability through the war of attrition.  Thus producing a climate of political collapse which is exactly what happened within South Africa with and the acceptance of a negotiated solution  without necessary defeating military opponents on the battlefield.  In this kind of war the objective is very seldom, it's hardly ever that of a military victory but rather of a political collapse.\n So in the South African situation, we had the situation developing that there was never a defeat on the military side, there was also not a victory on the military side but the instability and the war of attrition and the political collapse eventually had caused the developments in 1989 to 1994.  The key ingredients of the South African war therefore, I would say was violence, the military side of it, the mass action side of it, the terror side of it.  The terror aimed at non-combatants became a very important ingredient.\n The terror aimed at non-combatants is actually coupled to the concept of psychological war because war still remains a means of coercion and the idea was that through terror and through the actions also against civilians, the other side would be coerced in order to surrender.  Another key ingredient of the South  African war was that of propaganda and I'm referring to Radio Freedom, Sishaba and also to the own forces papers and the SABC.\n Then another key, the last key or the second last key ingredients that I want to mention is that of intimidation.  The kind of revolutionary war we had is a war directed at the minds of people, it influences people to think and act a certain way.  And the intimidation factor through necklacing, burning, threatening etc., and discipline within especially the townships, that factor of intimidation was a very important key ingredient of the South African war.\n So if you add to that, the concept the \"total war\" aspects of political initiative and also economical isolation and the idea of killing the opponent economically - the war of attrition idea, if you add that that gives you the concept of the kind of war which we've had up to now.\n The intention therefore was, to promote fear, instability and mobilisation of the masses.  Fear, instability and mobilisation of the masses then would add to psychological situation and that would add to the political collapse or be the final coercion that would be sought in this way.\n As there has been news during world war two, the intensive use of psychological operations bred dislike and hatred or creates sympathy on the one or both sides.  External support as well as the need for external manoeuvre and freedom of action is of vital importance to the revolutionary movements.  The external areas must also be chosen so as to inhibit and paralyse the external freedom of action of the Government forces, compelling them to be on the defensive, thus creating a scope for the revolutionary forces and making their opponents commit vast resources on the protection of the population and infrastructure.\n So this is where the external operations came from.  It was not possible to apply the key ingredients of the war from the liberation side without having external support in the South African situation.  The external support of the ANC came mainly from the USSR and it also came from external areas within the front-line States where they operated.  The Soviet attitude to such conflicts, the conflicts - the revolutionary wars was originally defied by Lenin who stated that they could only develop effectively in direct association with the revolutionary struggle of our Soviet Republic.  \n This became the permanent strategy of the Soviet block which saw the solidarity with the liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America, as a permanent area of collective action of communist parties.  Thereby revolutionary struggles were made an integral part of the Soviet global strategy during the cold war era.  And that brings me to the concept of the cold war era.",

            "My apologies Chairperson, but we regard this as very important.   Chairperson, if you come to the cold war, then what happened in the post-world war two situation, is that it was no longer acceptable to have wars between - for example the USSR and the USA because of the destructiveness of a nuclear war.  In other words the nuclear power became a deterrent in itself.\n The cold war situation developed and eventually we had in South Africa, on the one side the USSR block as a super power combining within the possibility of internal blocks such as for example, Angola, Mozambique and the liberation movements.  In 1970/75 round about, this was opposed by another super power, the USA, and they gathered around them the ability of some other groups or proxy forces such as Unita, such as South Africa, such as Renamo etc.  \n So we had a situation developing where it was not possible or where it was not likely that there would be a complete total war situation.  The people sort of followed the concept of fighting through proxy wars.  And this is what happened in South Africa, we had the interests of big or major powers, super powers amplified and cared for by the proxy wars in situations such as this.  So here we had the two opposing groups.\n I'm now trying to speed up Mr Chairperson. \n Most revolutionary wars were thus not only wars of liberation in Africa but also proxy wars for the super powers.  The revolutionary war situation in Southern Africa was therefore not only a war of liberation, it was part of a bigger struggle in the world - the USSR and their satellites versus the USA and their satellites.  There was a major conflict of ideologies such as communism and interests such as economic interests and this was complicated in Africa by the anti-colonialism situation and also by the anti-apartheid sentiments that existed in the world.\n Soviet policy had some explicitly declared objectives in Southern Africa,  firstly to establish and improve relations with the front-line States of Angola, Mozambique, Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia.  Those were strategic political objectives.  The USSR also tried to support and strengthen the national liberation movements in South Africa.  That was the indirect war idea, the idea of proxy wars.  And the USSR also decided to support progressive programmes adopted by African Governments which had embarked on non-capitalist development.  That was the economic side of the war.\n I'm now referring to the idea of a total war and I'm just listing the different aspects of participating.  Then the reaction of the United States and the reduction of the United States and the Western European influence.  That was another objective that they could achieve by proxy wars instead of a direct confrontation, USSR / USA.  And then to obtain the right to bases and reconnaissance in the area, thereby establishing their influence, thereby also make it possible for them to eventually dictate a presence in specific areas.\n The USSR also had the idea of limiting American and West European access to mineral resources in the region which considering the mineral wealth of the countries in Southern Africa, is a very important factor - that's an economic part of the total war or the cold war.   And then the threatening of oil supply routes of the United States and Western Europe around the coast, is another economic and military strategic aspect.  So this was a good example of major power interests served by the proxy war situation to keep yourself as a major power into a position - into a favourable position.\n The USSR therefore gave military aid and weapons and pre-positioned weapon systems, such as the anti-aircraft system in Angola, they gave technical assistance such as operating these, such as flying sophisticated aircraft.  They gave economic aid and they supplied the intelligence and the intelligence training. And through this they established in Southern Africa, socialist orientated States such as Angola with the MPLA as the main instrument in 1975, such as Mozambique with Frelimo in 1975, which followed the idea of Marxism communism and it was intended for South Africa too.\n So in this way the USSR was for us a conventional threat, a real physical conventional threat because they were actually present and they had their proxy agents present in Southern Africa.  And there was the revolutionary threat that is, the assistance to the liberation movements fighting against us.  So South Africa saw itself on the side of the West as an ally in the cold war conflict.  They worked with the international anti-Communist forces and they had to counter the internal insurrection or revolution within their own areas.\n I would just shortly go through the development of this strategy.  The threat did materialise, South Africa became only to feel the full effect of the threat when we had the Soviet intervention as a dominant feature in anti-colonial revolution such as ...[inaudible], Angola, Mozambique, Rhodesia, from the late '60's to the early '70's.  Prior to this, the South African defence force had actively begun to study revolutionary wars and we did so because we realised what the opposing side was going to use in South Africa.  We used the cases of Malaysia, Kenya, Algeria and we studied the works of Bufre, CA Frazer, John McKewan, Mao Tse Tung, etc.  This is how the was developed or the revolutionary war developed in Southern Africa.\n So just quickly to remind you that in Angola, the South African defence force started with helicopter support to the Portuguese when they were still there. In Rhodesia, the police assisted the Rhodesian security forces - the SADF's involvement was very small, only regarding some aircraft and especially helicopters.  In the case of Mozambique, the South African defence force involvement was very limited, logistical support, military liaison and exchange of intelligence.\n During 1975, the SADF had taken over responsibility from the police for counter-insurgency operations in South West Africa/Namibia.  It was our responsibility to do this in terms of the mandate of league of nations and we did actually do this for the sake of the defence of South Africa too, because it will be come clear to you with my further arguments, that we had a strategy of keeping the attacking forces as far away from the home or the heartland's of our territory as possible.\n The Cuban involvement which was part of the USSR block, started in 1974 with - no it was already in the '60's, with some 200 instructors to the train MPLA in the Congo Republic and Russian aid to the MPLA between '74 and '76 - estimated by the Western military sources, had been in the area of 400 million US dollars and it grew to 4 billion dollars by 1987.  \n The 200 instructors that we started off with in 1965 eventually grew later on to 7.000 troops in October '75, 14.000 in February '76, 17.000 in March '76 and at the end of the war in '76, the number of Cuban troops increased gradually to counter the military threat of Unita and Kabinda and separate movements and to maintain the MPLA in power.  At the height of this level in 1985, it reached the top of about 50.000 troops in December 1988.  I mention this to give you the idea as to what developed in our perception, as a real threat towards the security of not only South Africa but the whole of Southern Africa.\n This caused the Vorster Government - the then Vorster Government, to become involved in a total war situation and I was personally involved in this.  I was the representative of the South African defence force that first negotiated with the idea of giving support to Unita and FNLA and this was because of the Vorster's Government's expansion of their ideas of defence of South Africa - their participation in a total war.  \n This was a significant change in our defence strategy and to side on the side of FNLA and Unita against a Soviet backed MPLA in Angola, was a step in a direction which associated the South Africans with real Africans because previously we had been involved with colonialist forces.  I'm referring to the Portuguese situation in the Angola/Mozambique situation, I'm referring to Rhodesia too, now Zimbabwe.\n In 1975, we found it necessary - at that stage the situation had collapsed totally in Southern Angola and we found it necessary to protect the economic interests by taking the ...[inaudible] Ruakana scheme and protecting it and keeping it in operation for the purpose of supplying electricity and water to South West Africa.  \n So the aim of this operation by the Vorster Government was to have a political, economical and military enforcement.  It was therefore a start of a limited war and it started actually with the problems of the Alvor Agreement that was not kept by the forces within the Soviet block.  \n On the 5th of December the US Congress voted against further covert assistance and the amounts that I've mentioned on US aid, was the maximum that could have been given without Congress authority.  And when it was taken to Congress for the increase of this, the Congress voted against this mainly because of the Vietnam syndrome and the other problems at that stage within the United States.\n We were involved in the Angola war for the specific reason to enable Unita and FNLA to enforce the ALVOR Agreement which they thought would be enforced by the OAU and it would only be enforced if they could recapture their traditional areas after the occupation of these areas by the MPLA backed by the Cuban forces.  And they could only recapture that with some assistance from us because Unita and the FNLA forces were forces trained in guerrilla warfare and they did not have the ability to do some kind of conventional attack.  \n This is why we were involved as instructors and also assisting them in recapturing their traditional areas.  And that we had done exactly according to the plan and by the 9th of November 1975, we were in a position that the OAU could then enforce the ALVOR Agreement.   And the ALVOR Agreement basically determined that there should be a Government of national unity, there should be a Government of all the different groups in Angola participating.\n This we had in position by the 9th of November 1975 but the OAU failed politically until about 26 January 1976.  On 26 January 1976, the OAU eventually had a vote on this and it was 22 versus 22, so this then caused the collapse - the political collapse or what we tried to do in Angola.  Although we succeeded every inch of it militarily, we failed politically.\n What is important is to realise why we had to eventually withdraw in March 1976.  It was never the intention to capture Angola, it was a limited war enforcing the Agreement and the political siding with the anti-Communist forces of Unita and FNLA.  It was also because of very strong political pressure that the USSR exercised through the United Kingdom.  That was then eventually decided that the operation had failed because of the OAU failure to apply the principles of the ALVOR Agreement.\n We had certain lessons learnt from that.  Firstly, we had to update our armaments package, which we did.  This led to a very major or great development in the armaments industry inside South Africa.  Secondly, it was established that the build up of surrogate forces and Soviet armament on the South West Africa/Namibia borders was continuing at an alarming rate.  This was also aimed at providing SWAPO with secure bases in Angola and inhibiting any large scale intervention by South African forces.\n The South African defence force's need for intelligence reconnaissance and a widespread covert capabilities made it essential to continue with the development of special forces these specific reasons.  And I'll come back to special forces just now.  The third lesson emphasised the value of the link to the anti-Communist movements such as Unita, after which the revolutionary take-overs in Angola and Mozambique became one of the remaining buffers against the further east block expansion in Southern Africa.\n So eventually - if we now think back, we have learnt some valuable lessons but what the final contribution we feel that we have made - and I say this because of the discussion of motives and perceptions, we feel that the downfall of communism in 1989 was actually caused by a number of Vietnam's of the USSR of which the Southern Africa theatre was one and we were one of the major role-players in the Southern Africa theatre.  The other theatres are of course Afghanistan and the Middle East.\n I'm sorry Chairperson, I have to skip over a number of very important points but I will have to do this otherwise I will not come to the real crux of the matter.",

            "The problem is Chairperson, my presentation - I amplify the presentation with my personal experience in this because I didn't write the book itself, so I'm putting in practice what is in theory.  I'm coupling the practice - what happened with the theory which is in this.  If you just read the theory, you will find it very difficult to follow and that's the reason why I'm trying to deal with this.  So Chairperson, this is how the idea of international involvement of South Africa across the borders in the affairs - let us say, of countries such as Angola.\n It was all connected with the important international conflict of international - of communist expansionism.  This is the way we saw it and this is as far as we are concerned, a very, very, important motivating factor for us.  In fact it was certainly the major motivating factor and the fact that eventually this was achieved through the collapse of communism in 1989, at least gave us the satisfaction that this part of it, we did contribute some important aspects in this regard.\n Chairperson, I now want to read to you on the issue of cross-border operations and cross-border raids.  What Mr George Schultz, the United States Secretary of State had said.  He said: \"From a practical standpoint a purely ...[inaudible] defence does not provide enough of a deterrent to terrorism and the States that sponsor it.  It is time to think long, hard and seriously about more active means of defence, defence through appropriate preventative or pre-emptive actions against terrorist groups before they strike\".\n So this is basically the approach that we had also with the idea of cross-border operations.  It was therefore in this time of 1976 when we returned after the Angola assistance towards Unita, that we completely withdraw to behind the border of South West Africa but soon after that we found the SWAPO forces moving down, establishing basis just across the border and we had to apply the principle which I just read out to you about Mr George Schultz.\n From 1976 onwards - also regarding the ANC situation, now I want to switch away from the South West Africa towards the RSA front.  The ANC by now had the new strategy based on what they called: \"The Four Pillars of the Revolution\", a strategy for a people's war.  The Four Pillars were: the underground structure, mass mobilisation, armed offensive and the isolation of South Africa.  From '76 onwards, Angola became the maintaining centre of the ANC with Lusaka as the main operational centre.\n After '78, Mozambique became the pivot for armed action against the RSA with regional headquarters, the so-called machinery, being established at Botswana, Swaziland, Mozambique and Lesotho.  South African was being encircled from the North.  By the late '70's, both SWAPO and the ANC therefore had achieved two major requirements and that is, they had extensive external support and they had a source of arms with this external support.  And they had also achieved the principle of external manoeuvre.  \n They could effectively force us, or limit our freedom of movement within the other areas because we did not cross the border just for the sake of crossing the borders.  It was also a very, very, serious consideration before we crossed the border because of many implications such as international diplomatic security council - UN Security Council resolutions, we all had to bear this in mind.\n So what I want to emphasis at this stage Mr Chairperson is the fact that our operations across the border and in neighbouring States - was actually put by General Malan, the Minister then, when he said: \"in the present operational situation there is no controlled neutral zone between the RSA and the host countries of it's enemies.  The result is that the enemy is able to establish and operate it's bases, arms depots and logistical roots close the RSA borders with the approval of the host country concerned\".\n This means that the enemy can cross the border to lay mines, kidnap and intimidate and then within a few hours, return to the host country where he is unassailable.  No Government in the world can afford to tolerate a situation of this nature, consequently when the situation arises, the SADF has no other option than to launch pre-emptive operations across the border in order to destroy the enemy bases, depots and logistical roots and in this way to discourage the enemy actions on the other side of the border.\n So Chairperson, skipping a number of aspects, we at that stage - we were confronted on the Western front and the internal front with two problems.  The one problem was that in the South West Africa situation SWAPO situated their bases in Angola close to MPLA and Cuban force's bases, thereby making it difficult and risky for us to attack these bases.\n Inside South Africa, the ANC - we thought that eventually they would follow more or less the same strategy as SWAPO did, but they soon found out that it was not possible for them to do that.  And eventually the Cuban forces - sorry, eventually the SWAPO forces operated with the MPLA forces inside Angola and they assisted each other mutually whenever we tried to get at the SWAPO forces.\n In the case of the ANC and the PAC it was slightly developing differently,  their cadres were not operating from bush bases as we had in the case of Angola and South West Africa but mostly from houses, camps, similar facilities in or out of the outskirts of towns such as Maputo, Matola, Gaberone, Maseru and later also in Harare.  There bases were mostly clandestine facilities, small facilities and they often changed regularly.  A targeted bases could therefore be active on the one day and be gone the next day.\n Military factors such as accurate intelligence, security, surprise, infiltration and ex-filtration for the attacking force were of primary importance.  Because of this there has always been the danger that such facilities could included civilians, thus endangering the lives of property.  So SWAPO used the proximity of the Cuban bases and the ANC used the proximity of the human bush principle, firstly in the exterior situation and then later on interior situation too.\n Now in doing this, the ANC made a very important decision when they said in around about 1985/1983/84: \"we do not have forests in South Africa, the military machine would smash us if we would send a force from outlying areas, our masses have to serve as our bush, the Black community is our bush.  This was a very, very, important strategic change.  And Chairperson, strategies follow strategies and I would now like to take you back to this position because the year 1986 has been a very, very, influential year as far as the development and the character of the conflict in South Africa is concerned.",

            "Can I have transparency number one please.  Now this is just to show to you the rise of violence in South Africa.  In the first incidents we had an average of 52 incidents over the years '76 to 1983.  That virtually doubled towards the end of 1985 and it became 97 and then we had a rather steep rise to 1989 of 153.  I just emphasise that those were the average violent incidents in South Africa.\n Next transparency please.  Chairperson, this is a very important transparency.  The problem that I had personally, is to understand why it was ever necessary for the defence force to go to the establishment of an organisation such as the CCB.  And then I started to work on the figures and I want you to look at those graphs.  The soft targets - that was the number of incidents on soft targets, that is the dotted line.  You can see how that rose from 1983 until 1986 when it reached the peak of '83.  \n On the other hand the solid line was the one of hard targets - security forces, that dropped down to 17 in 1986.  And what I'm emphasising to you is, this is what happened when this decision was taken - the Black community needs to be our bush.  So here we had a complete new situation. We could deal militarily with the kind of threat which we had in South West Africa, easily but we were confronted in 1986 with a special situation.

So there you can see - and this is now the development of what has taken place on the instruction of the ANC and this is the effect of their new strategies.  \n The point I'm making - 1986, the year immediately after my retirement was a crucial year and the people really had to think hard towards finding new directions.  You will also recall that in 1986, the then Government found it necessary to publish some special regulations, some safety regulations in order to reinforce the ability of the people.  Those were emergency regulations.\n So the point I'm making - this let to the greater involvement and the greater importance of special forces and the CCB.

What I want to emphasise is, when we come to page 2.7 at the bottom, is that it stands\n\"the reason that all activities with the respect of special forces are planned and authorised under strictest security at the highest level.  Non-...[inaudible] is a requirement for external activities\"\n And I want to switch over to page 2.8 by saying that South African defence force special forces had the functions of intelligence gathering of deep penetrations attacks and applying force discriminatorily, not indiscriminately.  Which is a very important motivation with us when we decided on this kind of forces because if you think about the indiscriminate use of force in the second world war in bombing - strategic bombing, then this was a much better system and much more in line with the tradition of a just war principles, than to apply small scale forces that can discriminantly use the necessary force.\n Economic way -  there was also an economic way of using force and it was preventing escalation in Southern Africa.  It was easy to use a small force like this and then there would not be a heavy big reaction on the other side causing a lot of lies and more fighting.\n Now on the command and control, all I want to say is they were highly trained, they were specialists, they were a scarce commodity and a very valuable force and usually engaged in rather sensitive operations.  So invariably the level of control used to be very high.  In my case and I think also afterwards, it was certainly the case of the South African defence force.  \n We had one very interesting case - let me tell you about this.  We were attacking - also a cross-border operation and we were using vehicles and we had the worry as to what would happen if the other forces would find out and they will chase us.  And then we said that would cause a big fight and that a lot of unnecessary loss of life, so eventually we came to this very good solution - \"perde myne\", and we made a lot of \"perde myne\" - you know ...[intervention]",

            "Thank you very much.  And it did happen exactly this way and when we through this out without firing a single shot we avoided a rather big fight.  So the point I'm making is, this kind of special forces had some very, very valuable and good applications provided it would be handled at the top level.\n Now regarding the CCB, I will deal with the CCB and the functions.  Firstly, the CCB operated externally and internally.  There was an increasing requirement for clandestine and covert operations of a new kind in 1986.  A small group known as D40 was originally organised for this purpose.  D40 developed into Barnacle which later was transformed in the CCB.  The CCB was a covert military organisation managed by a managing director under supervision of a senior officer special forces.\n The function were - and that's very important, infiltration, in other words deep infiltration within the enemy itself and penetration of the enemy.  Penetration also in the areas - the deep areas where the enemy operated and secondly, the disruption of the enemy.  The CCB was organised into 10 regions, of which 7 of the 8 regions were operational regions.  Each region was responsible for the collection of it's own intelligence including region 6 which was the internal region where they collected military intelligence internally.\n Although this was a private structure for the purposes as I said before - in order to be able to handle with the situation after 1986 when the graphs changed, the Government - the military structure still had to be authorised by the Government and the military structure had to follow within our defence force, certain military procedures for authority.\n General Malan's remarks in this regard - I just want to mention two points that's on 2.10:\n\"In times of warring conflict people's perceptions change and they act differently to just viewpoints and actions in times of conflict from a narrow peacetime perspective is dangerous and negates the reality of experience in times of conflict\".\nThen also he said later on:\n\"During this time the Government's policy was clear - stop the perpetrator of violence at all costs.  The carrier of the car bomb, landmine, limpet-mine from the neighbouring States had to be destroyed outside the borders or inside the country before he could commit his atrocity.  The destruction of the terrorist is based and his capability was the mission of every soldier\"\n I'm referring this to you before you cut me - no, I still have some time.  I would  like to say that we developed some special strategies around about this time and now I want to have the transparency on the strategy please because at that stage we were looking for strategies and ever since 1980, we thought as to how to handle the change in attitude and the change in strategy by our enemy.  And this then gave us the defence strategy.\n Defence of South Africa with all available means within the law, against external aggression or internal revolution.  \n Secondly, suitable conventional capability to defend the RSA against the outside aggression pro-actively.  I'm referring to situations such as the Cuban involvement in Angola.\n Thirdly, effective intelligence network to support operations.  That for example included the CCB action.  Cross-border operations into neighbouring States has a preventative action in self-defence.  Many, many cross-border operations were coupled to this.\n Prevent a build-up of hostile terrorists or conventional forces outside the South Africa situation and support of anti-Marxist movements in Southern Africa to buffer Soviet expansion.\n Chairperson, I specifically mentioned this here because this was our mandate.  This was the political instruction as a defence force and it is around this strategy that we carried on after 1980 and especially in the very crucial stage of 1986, some important decisions had to be made in this regard.   Chairperson, from 1984 onwards - can I have the next transparency please, the conflict started to really enter into it's worst and most uncompromising phase.  \n I'm just going to mention in the transparency what happened in the period September '84 to August '90, the destruction of so many homes 7187, 1779 schools, 1265 shops and factories, 81 offices, 66 post offices, 49 churches, 29 clinics, 12.188 delivery vehicles, over 10.000 buses, over 4.000 SAP vehicles, 152 trains - all damaged and destroyed.  The financial loss from '85 to '86 - 90 million rand in this regard.  Necklaces and burning - you have already seen the graph, but it was 399 necklaced and 372 burnt to death.\n Chairperson, this was a crucial challenge to us, how do you deal with a situation such as this.  It was our responsibility to protect the people.  We were not involved with the internal situation of taking the war to the people, we had to protect the people inside.  That was our mandate and that is the reason why we went on.  \n And I now want to emphasis to you that within the RSA, the police were still the primary responsible organisation and we had to quickly find ways and means of co-ordinating between the police and the defence force because accountability wise, the South African defence force co-operated - and I'm reading on 3.37, the South African defence force co-operated with all departments and other role players in joint planning and joint execution of operations and accepted full responsibility for the execution of allotted operations or tasks.\n The South African defence force could not accept accountability for determining tasks or decisions to undertake an operation or activity because of legal restrictions.  The police remained the accountable insistence internally throughout for all security force deployment but we co-operated with the police.  In the national management context, each department acted in accordance with it's mandate and it's budget within each line department.  \n The South African defence force observed this principle and never infringed on the terrain in this respect but I must say it was difficult.  We were suddenly confronted with a situation where complete in strategy by the enemy and we were rubbing shoulders with the police.  We were very close to each other and it was not always easy to exactly discriminate between the tasks of the police and the other people.  I'm referring to the issue of accountability and the importance of close co-operation between us and the police.",

I ended by showing to you the development mainly in 1986 and I just wanted to say to you that this to us was a real worrying factor because previously we were fighting a military kind of was in bush, in isolated situations.  Here we found the war overnight or within a couple of months, completely transformed.  The protection was our responsibilities,  We could not send our troops in uniform into the townships because if you send a man in uniform there they are immediately seen, so, we had to find some other ways of operating in the townships but not being seen in the townships.\n The pressure of the Government was also heavy because the Government also had a responsibility especially towards their 3rd tier Governmental officials which were entitled to protection.  The revolutionary climate within the townships grew and the whole operation became most unpleasant.  And the flow of intelligence was very, very difficult and we had to do some special arrangements in order to get the flow of establishments going again.\n So we therefore found from 1984, but especially from 1986 onwards, a situation where the operations had a complete new character characterised by a total disregard of human values and thereby causing permanent damage to the human kind that we worked with.  I've shown you the transparency on the damage done, just think about the damage on education, the damage on the attitude of the people, just think about the damage done in reconciliation, the problem that we are faced with today.  \n This to us was difficult - how to approach this thing because in approaching this thing we have to be very careful because in the application of the just war tradition we had to bear in mind as to how do we react on this because if we now start fighting terrorism with terrorism, it would be equally bad as the terrorism itself.

And I would like to conclude by saying a few things and I will switch over back to Afrikaans again.\n In conclusion, I want to refer to our acceptance of responsibility.  As previous heads of the army, we do not want to avoid responsibility for our activities.  We want to put it on our shoulders of our subordinates who acted in a disciplined way in executing their duties.  We will not follow the way and try to place all the responsibilities to the top structures of the politicians.   This old defence force was undisciplined and would not have acted without authorisation.\n This struggle cost many lives, not as may as in big wars but these incidents were accepted so intensively by the people in the communities.  It caused a lot of hatred.  Every life is precious and the loss of a life is not acceptable.  We would have wished to avoid that but without negating our accountability, we did not choose this struggle, we reacted.  The strategy of terror had in itself the essence of the violation of human rights.\n The inter-action between strategies caused an unworthy character on both sides.  The world reacted against the destruction by nuclear war and certain steps were taken to avoid that.  And this war to interact on the spirit of people, this should also be regarded as unwanted.  This is a war in which people become victims.  In my contribution I wish to warn against easy judgement against uniformed people from both sides.  It is easy today during the luxurious circumstances where you can have a good night's rest to criticise the army and also the revolutionary people.\n These judgements will debase the spirit of these people.  This positive observation is the spirit between these people and can take place much easier than in the political atmosphere.  To put it shortly, we who fought against one another can make peace easier until the politicians come between us.  Forgive easier and make peace easier until political intervention, then the relations tend to harden.\n And a last observation.  The Commission was dissatisfied that so few defence force members applied for amnesty.   So few, almost a million were involved in operations over the years and that's true that a very few people applied for amnesty.  I want to give a few reasons.  In the first place the army is by far consists of conscripts, they came from all levels of society and for all political spheres.  I was not possible to contravene acts or these things would become known and the conscripts changed too regularly to become part of the gross violations of human rights.\n The defence force made a study in the 1960's and realised that good relationships should be maintained because we want to operate correctly and we tried to establish training programmes in this regard and there was no place for violation of human rights.  The most operations of the liberation armies were illegal.  There should be more applications from that side than from our side.  We can understand the position from the other side, they had to do these things to arrive to their purpose and that was why we requested general amnesty for situations of war.\n The argument which is posed that the army was an unfair situation is propaganda but legally that does not put the actions of the old army against the laws.  The old army - our primary task which has been given to us in a legal way, it was necessary to do these things and this will be the test of a reasonable person.  Another reason why so few applications for amnesty came from the army was that we respected the non-combatants.  We know terrorism and counter-terrorism ...[inaudible] killed non-combatants is not morally justifiable, that's why we had to avoid that.  \n There are sources available to saying that in a struggle like this, certain officials may be targets on moral grounds.  Regarding the principles of a justified war, activities should be planned in such a way so few people from the civil society should lose their lives.  This was not always possible but we never - we always took this principle into regard.  If this happened it was unavoidable but we do not regard that as gross violation of human rights.  The army followed a progressive training policy and with regular intervals these people were re-trained as new tasks and strategies developed, new training was done.  People were just not pushed into a certain situation, we had high level commanding officers, very high discipline and it had very good results. These people should not be estranged when they try to reach for reconciliation.  \n We always subscribed to high principles.  We've tried to explain why in the South African defence force there's no reason for many amnesty applications.  It is a very painful recollection that there has to be a few amnesty applications.  The people who deviated from the norm should not discredit this massive organisation who did their work well, this would create a negative perception.   You were wrong in your supposition when you asked the question that the army was responsible and that they have to apply for the gross violation of human rights but thank you for allowing us to be able to bring this under your attention today and that we could have been any assistance to you.

On his behalf I am instructed to inform you that you are at liberty to take note of the full contents of his amnesty application ...[inaudible] want to regard it as part of his testimony today.\n You will note from the amnesty application - it comprises out of two section, a general section as well as a section regarding four incidents.  His request today is that he is prepared and willing to testify and answer any questions that the Commission may deem necessary on the general side of his amnesty application but regarding the four incidents that is noted in there, he did not intend to testify on it and he will request the Commission to make a ruling that cross-examination will not be allowed on those incidents.\n The reason why I request the Commission to make such a ruling is that - as you are well aware, he has to present his amnesty application at a later stage before a different forum and cross-examination at this stage regarding those incidents might detrimentally effect the finalisation of that application.\n Furthermore, as far as his personal background is concerned, he has himself prepared a very short summary of how he perceived his role as - and I want I want to put it on record at this stage, he acted as a senior through his career mainly in an operation capacity as a General in charge of a unit that were deployed operationally.  He'd like in his own words, to give an indication what was his motivations for that and I would ask you the indulgence to allow him to give that to you and thereafter, he will be more than pleased to answer any questions.\n Finally, I'd just like to point out that his application not to be cross-examined no the incidents must be seen as an attempt to try and hide anything, it's an attempt to protect his interests and rights as far as his own application is concerned.

            "GEN JOUBERT",
            "Mr Chairman, may I start with the background?  When I left school in 1961, I joined the SADF as a volunteer, I had 32 years service as a soldier.  I've never had any other profession and only know one life and that is of a professional soldier.  During my career I had many command posts of which I would like to mention some - commander of junior infantry training, commander, 5th infantry battalion, commander 1, SA mechanised infantry battalion, infantry battle school, commander 82 mechanised brigade, commander sector 10, Ovambu in the present Namibia, commander in general of special forces, deputy head of information, deputy staff head of general staff.\n My career can be summed up in four phases.\nPhase one, mainly training before the war started.\n Phase two, mainly conventional corporations.\nPhase three, mainly involved in unconventional clandestine covert operations.\nPhase four, mainly in a staff and consulting capacity.\n In a historical context I would like to highlight the following:\nWhen I became aware - during those years of the previous dispensation and it's philosophies became widely known and became part of everybody's daily lives,  it was a time in which White people, especially the Afrikaner were politically very highly active and children were also being indoctrinated.  Even at schools, the previous dispensation's philosophies were openly propagated.  It was a shameful thing to think differently.\n The philosophy of military service as an honourable thing was already instituted in cadet training at school, section 31(a) of the Defence Force Act and the conscription service.  The likelihood of a war to gain control of the Republic was generally accepted.  These are the times in which we grew up, nobody doubted that the future belonged to the Coloured people but we must stress that the enemy was not the Coloured population but the churches propagated this as gospel.  \n And the activities of the liberation operations - when I started becoming self-sufficient around about 1961, was then in force.  Everyone, not only myself were exposed to one philosophy without question it.  As a soldier since 1961, I was already the product of perceptions formed beforehand and the protection of this former dispensation became my daily task.  I lived under military discipline and applied it.  I executed orders which I received from my superiors and I tried to execute these as best I could and I expected the same from my subordinates.\n I never doubted the political integrity of my leaders and accepted that the strategies, policies, planning which had been formulated at the highest level were in the best interest in the survival of South Africa.  My motivation was to execute the policies of the existing Government and to maintain order.  I believe that if I had to lead operations against the enemy, this was to combat communism and to prevent the subversion of the State.\n As a soldier my task was - as it was with everyone else, later on in the Defence Force Act, especially section 3(2):\n\"The defence of the Republic, prevention or suppression of terrorism, prevention or suppression of internal unrest, the preservation of life, protection of property, maintenance of necessary services, the maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime and co-operation with the South African police to be used in policing activities\"\n My motives were always my duties.  My duty was always to execute my duties as a soldier, it has nothing to with racism, it was coincidental that the majority of the enemy had a particular skin colour and it's for this reason that my activities were associated with a certain skin colour.  If I'd still been in the defence force, my duty towards the present Government would have been exactly the same.\n It was mostly people of my group who needed the protection of the defence force.  The protection of the inhabitants of South Africa is apparent from many documents.  Since the early '60's, the enemy attained a certain identity, namely that of a liberation movement.  You've listened to a lot of submissions in this regard so I'm not going to expand on this.  It's also quite clearly quoted in General van der Merwe's application.\n It is not surprising that there was a strong perception under South Africans that liberation movements were the aggressors and that the security forces had to counter this aggression.  It is abundantly clear that the battle or the struggle took on dimensions where the security forces either had to give up or start using unconventional methods.  It was clear that the ANC rejected a peaceful solution, this is also known to the Commission and I won't expand on this.\n I would like to sketch the general aspects which I included in my application and I would like to quote because this fits in with what the Commission demands from us:\n\"Through my position as commander of special forces and in the course of my duties as commander of the special forces and within the environment of my wider competence and general orders which I received from my superiors, to the extent which I did not get detailed orders, I believed that I still acted within my competence\"\n My application for amnesty is  - the actions I took were aimed against liberation movements and political parties, the ANC which was involved in a political and military war against South Africa.  And then also their assistants, activists and other people involved in the struggle with the aim of maximally disrupting these political and liberation movements.  All my actions were done bona fide in the belief that it was necessary to counter the military threat and due to my training and background, I believed that each action during this phase of the struggle was necessary and just to counter this threat.\n I received no compensation except my recognition which I got and no actions were made due to personal ...[inaudible] or any other considerations.  Through the support of the NP and the Freedom Front, I made these applications solely on the grounds of my position as a commanding general of special forces.  As a professional soldier, I was trained in a particular military culture and all that it entails.  Part of that was to execute the policy of the Government of the day as it was set out by the Government of the day.\n I never had any other motive than to perform my duty as a member of the defence force.  Every action I performed and every action in which I was involved was according to my perception, in reaction to the threat from the revolutionary forces.  The main aim was to stop this revolutionary onslaught.  I did not doubt that my actions were approved by my superiors.  The political military climate before and during these periods are contained in this submission.  By the nodal point of the SADF and also in what General Viljoen said, with which I agree and which I request that it be part of my application.\n The war had a clear military character which escalated up to the point that violence on all sides had grown enormously and that the actions by everyone impacted on helpless people.  Each party guilty of violence found it's own justification for it.  Any condemnation of this must be subjective or based on subjective moral considerations.  I want to refer you to the following information which is contained in this submission.  The nodal point where the nature and intensity of the struggle is apparent.  The quotes are here in the application, I'm not going to repeat all of them. \n What I want to say, in the middle to late '80's, one of the main aims of the security strategy to halt the mobilisation of these revolutionary forces, especially the ANC's.  The acceptance of this aim contained far more than was immediately apparent.  In the mid '80's it was clear that the onslaught could not be countered in normal conventional ways, so the defence force or the security forces had to become unconventional themselves.  Military reaction depends on violence, uses violence as a means of achieving peace.\n The success or value of violence lies in it's intimidatory nature on participants, sympathisers and helpers must be disrupted and destroyed.  Against this background a large percentage of my training took place and as a result of this I took over command in 1985, as a result of my training.  I also briefly want to stop with the CCB and special forces and I refer to the submission on the nodal point where it refers to the special service and the CCB and I want to add the following:\n The special forces was a unit for overseas and internal operations.  They were there to gather information on operations and external affairs as the intensity of the struggle increased.  And before I took over command, the special forces started executing clandestine operations outside the borders against ANC bases but it's operations were for a long time restricted to intelligence gathering operations overseas.  Special forces consisted of reconnaissance units and a small group known as D40 which eventually became Barnacle and then the CCB.\n Under my command their task was generally expanded into a - to support the SA police in it's internal covert operations.  The members of Barnacle were all in civilian garb and the name was never was never accepted.  And because civilian front organisations were created, the name Civilian Co-operation Bureau was used.  It was done with the full knowledge of all people at the highest level but it operated according to it's own set of financial rules and regulations which had been approved at the highest level.\n Insofar as my actions are to be considered by this Commission, I declare that I committed these acts in my capacity as General Commander in the special forces, I saw it as part of my duty and that no personal enmity or any personal gains played a role in this at all.  My actions were never motivated by racist considerations, personal enmity or personal gain.  It was aimed at ensuring the survival of the Government of the day.  \n Individuals who were eliminated were identified as people who played a material part in the struggle or could play such a part and were thus a serious threat to the State.  I regarded it as my duty to counter this threat.  I considered the country to be in a state of full scale war.  I never questioned the validity of the war and only served the country to the fullest of my ability and convictions.",

I found that unless you are analysing a very particular situation, that there could be other and better models, but in general terms, except where there is an immediate take over of power or a coup d'etat, that is to say in all other cases, where the battle had been fought, or the war had been waged over a longer period, the revolutionary war would more or less go through these four phases.",

We get all sorts of things, rumours, allegations, information, sworn statements, amnesty applications and because we are  a Commission charged with an investigative process, we wouldn't be able to ignore rumours, but what we think we should to is to be fair in our procedures.

Yesterday you may have heard that we were at the receiving end of precisely the same tenner of perception from members of APLA, that the TRC is on a witch hunt, it is seeking to criminalise acts which they were genuinely believing were acts in furtherance of a just cause, but central to their submissions was the fact that they have no confidence in the TRC.\n You have not gone that far, you have indicated what you conceded to say it is an inherent distrust.  I will want to say for purposes of today's record that there is no attempt by the Commission to call upon any people to apologise for things that they did if it is their view and perception that they did them for a good cause.\n Secondly the Commission seeks to say that we were appointed in a belief that we are men and women of integrity.  That is a difficult thing to defend, one's integrity, you can only state it.  And whilst I am very sad that it is clear from what you said, there is an inherent distrust of the TRC process in the members of the South African Defence Force, we can only say that we will try our best. \n If we put questions that are vigorous and robust, if as I indicated to you for instance, that there are people who would regard the sort of answer that you gave to a specific question, with a pinch of salt, it is not in any way an indication that we have predetermined issues that we have a witch hunt for specific institutions.\n It is all in an endeavour maybe a lame endeavour, to arrive at a balanced view.  I think part of these hearings, part of the reason that we have these hearings was because we felt that people were in the armed forces, whether statutory or non-statutory, have not had an opportunity to give a perspective.  Their perspective as people in the armed forces.  So to the extent that you have not only come but have stayed even beyond the hours that you were supposed to be here, you have assisted us and I need to record my personal and sincere appreciation for that effort.\n I also have to thank you for having indicated that some questions should be put and you will do your best to reply at them within the next 30 day period.\n I would only hope that since you represent the future, certainly in the armed forces, in so far as you have transcended the barrier of the past and you are part of the future, you should be one person that should make sure that all of the things that were contained in the Steyn report, remain only rumours and allegations certainly for the future because this Commission would have been in vain if any of the things that are mentioned as allegations, were to come about in the future and you are part of that future, and a very central figure in that future because you are at the Head of the armed forces.\n I believe that subject only to those questions which would be put to you and which you have indicated you will reply to, we should bring the proceedings today to an end, but your legal representative indicates that he possibly needs to respond or you need to respond to the remarks that I have made.",
