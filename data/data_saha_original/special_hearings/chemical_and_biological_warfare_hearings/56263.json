Welcome to the continued hearing into the Chemical and Biological Warfare programme.  \n Before we proceed I think it's perhaps appropriate for me to just again put on record the names of the panel presiding, whereafter I will ask the legal representatives to do the same again.\n On my right, extreme right, is Dr Wendy Orr.  Next to me is Yasmin Sooka.  On my left is Dr Fazel Randera.  And I am Denzil Potgieter.  We are the presiding panel.

            "Thank you.\n\"In my opening statement in my evidence to the TRC on Thursday the 11th of June 1998 I outlined the role that I played with respect to the TRC investigation; the Office of Serious Economic Offences investigation; the investigation by the Office of the Attorney General; the investigation of the National Intelligence Service and later the National Intelligence Agency which resulted in the production of the document known as Project Cloud I made available to the TRC in 1997.  And finally my relationship and responsibilities with respect to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Non-Proliferation Council within the Department of Trade and Industry.\n I also indicated that in the above period I had to brief and advise all the relevant Ministers as well as President de Klerk and President Mandela personally on certain issues and indicated that I had briefed certain Parliamentary committees on the CBW programme.\n I then indicated that I would be referring to all the above activities and to documents that had a bearing on the programme including my briefing to the TRC on the 21st of January 1997 and the Project Cloud document of the National Intelligence Agency dated October '97 with the understanding that I could not be held responsible for any information that would lead to proliferation or a threat to the RSA's international relations if it became available to the media through my testimony.\n Since that statement I have been questioned on a number of issues on which the answers provided by me may have created the impression that I did not act expeditiously on information that became available to me at the time. \n Furthermore it came to my attention that I had erroneously referred to a meeting with the National Intelligence Service as having occurred on the 24th of September '94 instead of the 24th of September '93, which clearly added to the impression that I had allowed a long time to pass before I acted decisively.\n I therefore wish to put all the events that took place from '92 onwards, and in which I played a part, into perspective so that -\n One, the true position as I experienced it can become visible and,\n (b)  all the actions that I took can be valued objectively.\n With reference to my concern that some of the information in this affidavit may have a proliferation danger or may have a negative effect on the RSA's international relations I have made a copy of it available to the office of the State President so that it's legal representative may advise whether the statement can or should be made in an open hearing or in camera.\n A copy has also been made available to Mr Mike Kennedy.\n After I took over as Surgeon-General on the 1st of March 1988 and up to November 1992 I was satisfied that Project Coast had been managed exactly according to the official mandate as conveyed to me according to the political decisions that had been taken by the Ministers of Defence since 1981, as well as by the State President, Mr de Klerk on the 26th of March 1990, as well as by the special Cabinet committee on Sensitive Projects appointed by Mr de Klerk on the 20th of September 1990, and as confirmed at a mini-defence command council meeting on the 25th of October 1990.\n The briefing to President de Klerk and the minutes of the mini-DCC is included in Appendix A.\"\n Now Mr Chairman, at this point I would like to refer to that Appendix and draw your attention to certain things in it.  May I proceed with that?",

            "Thank you.  If the Commission looks at the briefing to the State President, I am not going to read the entire briefing, you have it available if you wish to do so at your leisure.  I want to refer to page 3, paragraph 10, in which a discussion was held with the State President with regards to the nature and the effect of chemical and biological weapons and the explanation that is given here is -that in the Western world there was a change taking place.  It reads as follows\n\"It was moved away from research and development regarding weapons of destruction and two new approaches were taken\nA. The development of chemical weapons which are not non-destructive that can impair the brain function of the target groups that they cannot function properly and can easily be attacked by conventional weapons\".\n Then I want to refer you further on, after we discussed with the President the aims and objectives of the project and the way that it has been run up to then, page 4, paragraph 18 under the heading \"Threat to the South African Defence Force\".  I want to draw your attention to the second half of that paragraph which reads -\n\"We, however, in 1986 found certain bomb shrapnel after a supposed attack on Unita and we tested that for chemical agents, namely with the code name DM. This agent is an incapacitating agent which causes irritation of the eye and throat, disorientation, nausea, vomiting and depression\".\n A discussion then follows about the developments after that finding, and on page 5 I wish to draw your attention to paragraph 23.  This is with reference to the chemical company that had been established and what it was working on -\n\"This plant concentrates on research in and the production of incapacitating and irritating agents.  These agents are built into weapon systems together with Armscor.  A new type of teargas was developed which could be used effectively\".\n Finally if you would allow me with regards to the biological research and development, page 6, paragraph 27 -\n\"Our biological plant, this is RRL, is responsible to keep up to date with all potential threats, and to do this it is continuously producing new organisms so that the threat can be updated and that preventative and treatment methods can be updated\".\n In essence that document refers then to what we put in front of President de Klerk and what he approved.  His approval was that we could continue with the incapacitating agents and with the irritating agents as had been presented to him; that we should stop all further research on any deadly agents.\n The next document, if I can take you back to my statement where I refer to the second document, namely the minutes of a mini-DCC, that's what you have in front of you in that same Appendix, and you will see it's a thick document.  You will see that it reads:\n\"These mini-DCC, Defence Command Council meeting held on the 25th of October\".\nYou will also see, by the way, that General Steyn attended that meeting.  And here I want to just very briefly take one or two paragraphs on page 1, paragraph 2:\n\"The purpose of this meeting was\n 1 - to provide background regarding the status of development of chemical weapons in the Project Coast.\n 2 - the decision regarding the research should be re-established based on the present directive and the State President's instruction regarding the establishment of technology\".\n Why I am showing you this, Mr Chairman, is to show you that the decision of the State President was carried through to the Defence Command Council and from there obviously to the Co-ordinating Management Committee.\n And then on page 2, paragraph 5(B):\n\"The State President provided authority for research into chemical weapons and not into the production of deadly chemical weapons\".\nand let me explain what that means.  It means incapacitating agents or irritating agents.\n I want you then to turn to the appendix to that document which was a document to the same mini-DCC with the proposed new philosophy for chemical and biological warfare. Again you will notice that the person who drew up the document is Brigadier Basson.  He will, if I take you to the relevant paragraphs, if you look at page 3, paragraph 10A, that the decision that was given to us or the direction that was given to us through our State President is reflected here:\n\"The development of chemical weapons which are not deadly but which can impair the brain functions of target groups so that they cannot function in an orderly fashion, and they could be approached easier than with conventional weapon\".\n It also deals on page 4 with the implications - \"the implications of the chemical threat for the South African Defence Force\", a discussion of that.    I am not going to read it all Mr Chairman.\n And then I refer you to page A6, the main conclusions of:\nThe chemical warfare and the conclusions and what was decided then during this Council.  Paragraph 32.\n\"To avoid this threat the Defence Force has to do the following\n Keep up-to-date about the research regarding the offensive threat;\n keep up-to-date regarding research regarding the latest technology to protect against chemical weapons and a system of training of chemical warfare and to maintain that as if the physical threat could be fought against and,\n to develop a command structure which can take proper decisions\".\nOn the next page -\n\"The technology in South Africa establishes and provides protective clothing according to the new standards and to improve this ability and to establish the technology in South Africa, not to produce chemical weapons of mass destruction.  And to develop operational activities in which the above five points can be incorporated, rationalisation of functions will take place and central co-ordination is also important\".\n And further on that same page under the heading \"Offensive chemical warfare philosophy\".\n\"It is proposed that the South African Defence Force develop a research capability regarding limited production of non-deadly chemical weapons and maintain that\".\n And regarding the defensive policy, page A8, paragraph 35, \n\"It is also recommended that the Defence Force should develop an offensive capability which should entail protection\".\n Finally if you look at page A12 -\n\"Establishment of the production technology for non-deadly weapons\".\nParagraph 59 deals with the steps that will be followed in achieving that.\nAnd then finally paragraph 60, the first sentence -\"In this regard Project Coast has already developed one chemical warfare agent, namely the so-called NGTR, a new generation teargas\".\nAs you will see later on that refers directly to the CR that was developed in the programme. I use these two documents to illustrate to you that the guidance that was given to us by the President were followed through into the Defence Command Council and were applied exactly in that fashion and was carried through into the Co-ordinating Management Committee and into the project.\n If I can now take you back to where we were on my statement. \n\"During December 1992 President de Klerk announced the early retirement/retrenchment and/or dismissal of some 23 military officers after General Pierre Steyn had submitted his report on the alleged activities of the South African Defence Force to the Cabinet on the 18th of December 1992.\n Brigadier Doctor Wouter Basson of the South African Medical Service was one of these officers.  At the time I was in London on the way back to the Republic of South Africa, having attended the AMSES Congress in the USA and visiting the Boots Pharmaceutical Plant in Nottingham in the United Kingdom.\n The Chief of the South African Defence Force, General Liebenberg, phoned me in London to inform me about Mr de Klerk's decision and to enquire whether I would be available to be appointed as Acting Chief of the South African Defence Force over the Xmas holiday period, with the responsibility to deal with the administrative process required to carry out the instruction of President de Klerk.  I indicated that I would be available.\n On my return to the Republic of South Africa, I immediately enquired as to the circumstances that led up to this decision with specific reference to the position of Doctor Basson and was simply told that it could not be discussed in detail with me but that the President had appointed the Steyn Commission in additional to the Harms 1990, Goldstone 1991 and Hiemstra 1991 Commissions, to conduct and investigation into the Intelligence Services of the South African Defence Force and the South African Police, with special reference to their role in possible third force activities.\n In addition I was informed that all findings would be handed over to Mr d'Oliveira of the Attorney General's office for possible criminal proceedings against individuals found to be involved in such activities.  \n Not satisfied with what I was told and quite alarmed about the position of Doctor Basson who was playing a critical role in the privatisation of the front of Project Coast, and I'm referring here specifically to DG Scientific and R&L, as well as to recovering some funds and closing accounts which were still in existence in Europe.  I tried in vain on two occasions to arrange to see Mr de Klerk personally through the office of the Minister of Defence which was then Mr Louw.  \n I also had telephonic discussions with General Liebenberg in this regard and was eventually asked by him to visit him at his holiday home near George and to bring Doctor Basson with me.  At this meeting I was asked to allow him to speak to Doctor Basson alone and thereafter informed that he had explained to Doctor Basson why it was found necessary to put him on early pension, but that it would be appreciated if he could still be available to the Surgeon General after the 31st of March 1993, in a voluntary capacity in the Citizen Force Reserve, to finalise outstanding issues within the project.\n I was again assured that the d'Oliveira investigation would undoubtedly deal with any so-called third force activities.  Somewhat reassured I proceeded to deal with the documentation of the 23 officers involved, with the help of the Chief of Staff Personnel of the Defence Headquarters and with a rather serious negative reaction with the Defence Command Council with respect to the role played by General Steyn in what seemed to them to be an unfair dismissal of senior officers in the South African Defence Force, without any visible application of the rules of natural justice including the audi alteram partem principle.\n In this regard I had several discussions with General Pierre Steyn, who was clearly also disturbed by the animosity of his fellow members of the Defence Command Council.\n Important to note was the fact that General Pierre Steyn indicated at the time that he was not at liberty to disclose what he had reported to President de Klerk and that we should leave the matter in the hands of the d'Oliveira investigation.\n In this regard the contents of the so-called Steyn Report was not revealed to me in any way until I received a translated copy of the staff paper used by General Steyn, from Mr Mike Kennedy in February '97\"\nAnd you have this document in front of you as Appendix B.  This document was as far as I can judge, a translation of the TRC document number 111 in the bundle of documents for this hearing.\n On the 7th of January 1993 - I beg your pardon Mr Chairman, if I can just refer to that document.  I'm not going to discuss the contents.  You will see at the bottom right-hand corner where it was handed over to me by Mr Mike Kennedy on the 25th of February 1997.\n\"On the 7th of January 1993, the new Minister of Defence, Mr Louw, was briefed about the state of the project and what the implication of the pending signing of the New Chemical Weapons Convention by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, due to take place on the 14th of January '93, would be.\n The full briefing plus confirmatory notes of the briefing drawn up on the 8th of January '93 and signed by the Minister are included in Appendix C\"\nMay I please refer you to that document?  Again Mr Chairman, I am not going to read the entire document but I'm simply going to point out to you that in this document the entire project as it was mandated and initiated initially by General Malan, with its aims and objectives, with the phases that it went through, is described in some detail.  Particularly I want to refer to page 4, paragraph B, Heading: \n\"Phase 2: The Commercialisation Phase\"\nwhere it reads as follows:\n\"Continuation of research and identification of research objectives for production owing to guidelines given by the State President after briefing given to him in 1994\"\nAnd then the next paragraph C:\n\"Phase 3\"\nparagraph (iv):\n\"A submission to the Parliamentary Committee regarding sensitive matters being investigated by the State.  This Committee consisted of various Ministers and during this the contents of the project was made clear to them\"\nThe rest of the document deals with, in some detail, with these different phases to bring the Minister totally up to date.  I would like to refer you to page 7, paragraph 27:\n\"Offensive Equipment Obtaining and Research.  According to the guidelines by the present State President in 1990, only irritants and incapacitating measures were made which can be used in counter insurgence.   These are a CR derivative, an irritant B, which is a BZ variety incapacitating, C, a methaqualone derivative which is incapacitating, D, dimethyl amphetamine which is incapacitating\"\n We then proceeded to discuss with the Minister what the implications of these substances were with regards to the pending CWC Convention and this is what is reads on page or rather paragraph 28 on page 7:\n\"The BZ variant leaves us with the least problems.  We produced 1000 kilogram's for weapons which would take place in 1993. This substance was on the list: \"Prohibited Agents\" and we were compelled to announce this or destroy it.  The last option will be the preferable one\"\nAnd the next paragraph, 29:\n\"The NGT provides fewer problems\"\nNow Mr Chairman, I can deal with this in great detail but basically what it says there is that CR as an irritating agent is not prohibited by the New Chemical Weapons Convention.  You do have to declare that you have it in your possession but no other requirements are necessary.  We therefore indicated to the Minister that we could carry on with the CR although we were going to sign the Convention within a week.\n And then on page 9, the confirmation again with regard to the incapacitating agents, sub-paragraph 37:\n\"Incapacitating agents as previously described, the Defence Force has two incapacitating agents\"\nMr Chairman, that refers to the BZ variant that I've already dealt with and the second was the dimethyl \"ketoon amfetamien derigaat\"(?) ...[no English translation] which will come forward again later on in the hearing.  And then finally under recommendations on page 10:\n\"It should be continued with the defensive projects under Armscor\"\nWhat is meant there is the production of masks, filters, clothing, detection apparatus, decontamination.  42:\n\"That the SADF will not declare that it has this agent and will go ahead with the production of this in the form foam until its been completed.  This work should be done covertly to be able to be protective\"\nMr Chairman, I would like to explain in this regard.  Signing the Convention means that South Africa becomes a State party to that Convention, however the Convention must then be ratified and the number of countries that have to ratify it in this case were 65 and after 65 countries ratified it, then it enters into force 6 months after ratification.  \n So what we said to the Minister here is: \"We can carry on, we don't have to declare it now.  When the Convention one day is ratified and enters into force 6 months later, that is when we will have to declare that we are in possession of CR.\n And third recommendation 43:\n\"That all work in connection with other the two incapacitants should be ceased and that all raw materials should be destroyed in the presence of a member of the South African Police so that a certificate of destruction be supplied\"\nBecause I realised that this was an important meeting and these were important decisions taken by the Minister, I had the secretary of this meeting, which was Colonel Steyn, draw up confirmatory notes immediately. That is the second part of this documents.  You will see:\n\"...[no English translation] George on 7 January, the date here is 8 January\"\nAnd I only want to refer you to the final decision by the Minister, page 3: Decisions, paragraph 13:\n\"The Minister accepts all the above three recommendations as described here\"\nAs I read it to you from the original meeting.  And 14:\n\"The Minister gives instructions that all technical and scientific documentation regarding this programme should be put in a safe place so that the programme can reactivated if necessary.  The Defence Force should not limit the capability to prevent anarchy and they should not leave these capabilities\"\nYou'll see my note there in my own handwriting, the instruction to Brigadier Basson with regard to recommendations, paragraph 12:\n\"To have negotiations with SAFCOL\"\nIn other words to go ahead with the process of destruction and obtaining a certificate to this effect from the police.  And you can also see right at the bottom in the handwriting of the Minister what he said about: \"NGT\".  I have difficulty in reading it but I'll try:\n\"Because NGT is not a listed agent regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention and because its regarded to be used in the control of riots.  I approve it, but before this agent is used it should first be cleared out with the Minister or the State President\"\nThat deals with this Appendix Mr Chairman.  If I can go back to my statement.\n\"After this briefing I also privately brought the Minister up to date with the position of Doctor Basson, as outlined above\"\nMr Chairman, if I may just explain this.  I'd already told you that I'd seen General Liebenberg at his holiday house and discussed the position of Basson and what he had said to me at the time.  This is what I have related to the Minister then.  \n\"I also informed the Minister that I had received a letter from the Offices of Serious Economic Offences, the date of it, the 8th of December 1992, informing me that they were conducting an investigation in accordance with Section 5 of the Act on the Investigation of Serious Economic Offences, 117 of 1991 in Armscor, with special reference to Brigadier Basson.  This letter and my reply to it dated the 11th of January 1993 is of importance because it contains a lot of information about Project Coast and how it was managed and in particular it mentions the fact that I had experienced some difficulties with the control over Brigadier Basson with respect to operational use of products with the project and how I tried unsuccessfully to rectify it.\n A copy of the letter from the Offices of Serious Economic Offences and my reply to it, which was also made available to the Minister of Defence, is included here, Appendix D\"\nIf I may refer to Appendix D and again Mr Chairman, I will not deal with the entire document but only the relevant paragraphs.  First of all at the back of the document is the letter that I received, dated the 8th of December, with a whole number of questions.  I refer specifically to paragraph 12 which reads as follows:\n\"Under whose control did he work and who authorised his activities\"?\nand in my answer, I want to refer you to the answer to that question, page 13, question 12:\n\"Under whose control did he work and who authorised his activities\"?\nAnd I will read that to you.\n\"Brigadier Basson was after his appointment in the Defence Force, under the control of the Surgeon General and he is responsible for medical and other activities responsible to the Surgeon General.  Brigadier Basson was under operational control of the Commanding Officer Special Forces and the Defence Force as from March 1981 and all his military activities were controlled by this instance.  Since the 1st of March 1988 I personally controlled him and it was confirmed by his appointment as Director of Research and Development in my headquarters.  Regarding the project under discussion, Brigadier Basson was responsible for the Co-ordinating Committee for the management of this project.  This includes research, development and production and his activities were authorised by this body.  The situation regarding the operational application of the products delivered by this project was different.  In this regard Brigadier Basson was tasked by the user or the person who gave the instructions.  These people who gave instructions were the Minister of the Defence Force, the Minister of Defence, the Head of the Defence Force, the Commanding Officer Special Forces, the Head of Staff Information, the Commissioner of the South African Police, the Commanding General of the South African Police and the Director General National Intelligence Service.  The above state of affairs was not acceptable for me and I objected to this to General Geldenhuys, the Head of the Defence Force.  He took note of my objection but the practice continued.  In the cases where Brigadier Basson was tasked operationally by the abovementioned people, the Management Committee of Project Coast only knew about that after the operational need had been satisfied\"\nI would like to explain this.  The main product at that stage was the CR that had been produced and we had in our possession and was being utilised by all of these instances that I'm mentioning here.  And let me just make it clear Mr Chairman, the Medical Service is not a combat arm of service.  The Medical Service cannot apply any of these substances, it can only be done by Combat Services and that is why these individuals that are mentioned here are all in charge of combat or operational forces.\n Perhaps I should refer to page 16 where I repeat to the Offices of Serious Economic Offences what I have said to the Mini Defence Command Council in paragraph 63:\n\"Furthermore I want to indicate that the present State President on the 26th of March 1990 in the presence of Malan, Geldenhuys, Liebenberg and myself was informed by Basson regarding the status and scope of Project Coast.  The State President provided approval that the project could be continued regarding the offensive research objectives and that attention should be given to the irritants and incapacitants.  This instruction was followed to the letter and in a cabinet meeting regarding sensitive projects consisting of du Plessis, de Villiers, Coetzee and Viljoen, Brigadier Basson on the 20th of September brought these people up to date with the present state of affairs\"\nMr Chairman, obviously this letter is to the Office of Serious Economic Offences, they are looking at financial abuses and that is why the answer is directed more towards the financial side in which they had an interest in at the time.  I add to this that during this briefing I was not present because of other responsibilities.\n Then Mr Chairman, simply to show you that the process that had been followed by myself was one of, in my opinion, responsibility to ensure that the guidelines given by the State President is conveyed to everybody that had to know it and that the circumstances around it was explained in every case.\n Now I go to my statement:\n\"On the 14th of January 1993, Mr Pik Botha signed the New Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention in Paris.  I was part of the delegation that accompanied him as an advisor and in this regard I confirm that I had briefed him before the time about the fact that we had a Defensive Chemical and Biological Warfare Programme but that its mandate was within the provisions of the original Geneva Protocol of 1925 as well as with the Biological Weapons Convention of 1975 and would remain so with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention, also after ratification and entry into force.\n During February 1993, Brigadier Basson reported to General Liebenberg and myself that a transaction that had taken place in Croatia on the 6th of November 1992 had resulted in a loss of project funds because of the arrest of the agent he used to facilitate the transaction.\n As it was believed that these funds could be recovered quickly, General Liebenberg approved personally that Brigadier Basson could return to Croatia to attempt to rectify the situation.  This ultimately resulted in Brigadier Basson himself being detained in Switzerland together with the agent on charges of fraud in June 1993.  These happenings obviously impacted directly on the Office of Serious Economic Offences and Auditor General's investigations.\n Along with these events, my and Colonel Ben Steyn's activities were directed to carrying out the instructions of the Minister of Defence as given the briefing of the 7th of January 1993 and reporting the relevant facts to the Co-ordinating Management Committee at its meetings on the 29th of January 1993 and the 31st of March 1993. \n In particular the procedure followed to terminate all work on the incapacitating agents and to destroy all ground substances and existing agents and to obtain a certificate to this effect, were confirmed and were documented.  All of these and other relevant documents are included in Appendix E\"\nAnd please, I write an NB here, these documents should be read with what I dealt with in Appendix C.  Mr Chairman, if I can take you through that very quickly.  The first document in this bundle is a quotation that was received from Medchem Technologies for a substance called DNA Dimethyl Phenathelimine, code name Baxil and it is dated the 30th of July 1992.  And I then sign an order directed to Doctor Philip Mijburgh of Medchem Technologies, dated the 7th of August 1992 and I say, I refer to the substance DNA Dimethyl Phenathelimine, Baxil and I then place an order for the production of 1000 kilogram's of this product.   I want to draw your attention to what I add in my letter:\n\"Regarding your request for protection against prosecution, I want to inform you that it is just within our ability to protect you regarding the provision of raw materials and the production of the products.  Any irregularities which occurred during the production and the illegal provision to other people will be the full responsibility of the management\"\nMr Chairman, that substance that is ordered there is the second incapacitating agent that I referred to in my briefing to the Minister, that had developed and that had received.  In other words on the 7th of January the next year we had received it and that we were ready to weaponise it.  However, in view of the State President's decision, he would have to decide whether we could go ahead.  That refers to the briefing to the Minister.\n The next document in that bundle is dated the 9th of November, it says:\n\"Confirmation of the receipt of products received from Project Coast injuta\"\nI want to take you specifically to the last paragraph, paragraph 4:\n\"At the moment the following agents are available which we would be translated into certain products:  1000 kilogram's product  B\"\nThat is the BZ product that I referred to before when I briefed the Minister later on.\n\"And 500 kilogram's product M\"\nThat is the Methaqualone on which we briefed the\nMinister.\n\"30 kilogram's product C\"\nThat was a cocaine derivative substance that we also included at that stage.  \n Now what I want to point out is, this was on November.  I believe that Doctor Koekemoer in his evidence here indicated to you that the delivery of the Baxil took place early in January, that is why it is not reflected on this document.  However, if you refer back to my briefing to the Minister on the 7th of January, you will see that I say that we have in our possession two incapacitating agents and I indicate 1000 kilogram's of each.\n The instruction of the Minister that these products had to be destroyed is contained in the next document, the document dated the 30th of March:\n\"Certification regarding the destruction of chemical products on the 27th of January 1993\"\nI refer you to paragraph 2:\n\"The load consisted of the following: 18 blue plastic drums, weight so and so, product M.  73 metal drums, product BX.  C: white metal drums, D: small plastic containers, F: green metal drums\"\nMy copy is a bit unclear, it looks like:\n\"21 green metal drums, B: four papers drums and two cartons\"\nMr Chairman, these products refer to the products which were given to the Minister in his briefing:\n\"M being Methaqualone, BX being Baxil, C being Cocaine and B being BZ\"",

            "I apologise for that.\n If you then look at the rest of the document you will see that at the time it was decided to take blind samples of four categories of drums that were destroyed and they were destroyed by flying them out into the southern Atlantic ocean, deactivating them and then throwing them into the ocean and we had attached to this document - or rather, before we get to that, a signature of a Commandant de Bruyn which was the representative of the Chief of Staff Intelligence and a declaration by Doctor Basson which says:\n\"The samples were later handed over to Commander de Bruyn after they were deactivated.  The samples were taken on the day of the destruction\"\nIn accordance to what the Minister authorised us to do and in accordance to my instruction to Doctor Basson, this was taken to the forensic laboratory of the police and the next attachment to that same document is the declaration by Brigadier Strauss in which he then certifies what he had received as samples or \"monsters\", paragraph 3:\n\"During he proceedings of my duties I received the following sealed samples from Colonel Steyn: A holder marked product B, a holder marked product BX, one marked product C and one with no alphabetical identification.\nAccording to my information it was marked product M, it did not remain clearly visible but in his following paragraph he says:\n\"During the carrying out of my duties I analysed these samples and identified the contents.  Product B was BZ, product BX which I told you was Baxil, product C\"\n With all respect, I'm not a chemical person.  We can ask Professor Folb if he can confirm whether this was the same product that I signed for but I was satisfied that this was Baxil.  Product C is the Cocaine Hydrochloride and the fourth is Methaqualone.\n He gave us a further statement, it was excluded.  Paragraph 3:  \n\"Further to my statement of the 6th of the 9th, I rectify a typing error\"\n There's another document attached to this document and that was an exercise that had to be performed at a later stage.  We had to give information to the Auditor General about the value of the substances that had now been destroyed and there is a document which says: \"afskryf waardes\", which was drawn up by Doctor Basson.\n At a later stage, there's a letter attached here which had to be signed by the Chief of the Defence Force as the Chief Accounting Officer of the Defence Force, that was the letter in January '95 where he repeats the information that Basson gives here and he signs the document to say that that was the value of the substances.\n I just want to add one additional point Mr Chairman.  If you look at each one of these substances: M, BX, C, P and B and you look at the quantities and where the values were estimated, then you will see that those quantities are in agreement with the amounts that I gave to the Minister and I said they were in the  possession of the SADF.  I was satisfied that all the products which had to be destroyed were destroyed.  \n Just to complete the picture I also added the minutes of the meetings, the CMC.  The first one you have there is the 29th of January.  You will see from the certificate of destruction that it took place in the evening of the 27th.  In these minutes which took place on the 29th, in paragraph 5 Brigadier Basson also gives feedback regarding the destruction of all measures and substances which would not be used in future and this includes the incapacitants.   I think that that is all that I want to point out in that particular minute.  \n If you look at the next one dated the 31st of March 1993, paragraph 3:\n\"Brigadier Basson handed over the destruction certificate, it was given.  The samples were still in possession of the Sectional Commander and Brigadier Basson said that these samples were taken and destroyed and after a long discussion it was said that these samples would be analysed at the forensic laboratory and thereafter destroyed and the certificate would be attached to the destruction certificate\"\nThis is to demonstrate to you that the Co-ordinating Management Committee was kept in the picture as to this process as it developed.  \n Lastly, much later - the document I attached here, because there were questions whether that flight actually took place or not, I have a letter which was written to the Chief of the Airforce by the Office of the Attorney General.  It's addressed to General Hechter and it says:\n\"During the investigation of Doctor Basson it was it was found that allegedly certain substances were, fell into the sea on the 27th of January.  All flights were scheduled flights.  There was a certain flight, H28 which on the 28th of January was tasked for training via Waterkloof and this flight went over the sea.  It is important to note that the flight plan of this flight used by Wouter Basson should be made known.  The name of the navigator, the name of the pilot and the list of all the passengers should be provided and also what type aeroplane was used and the route it followed and also the contents of the freight.  The declarations are necessary for the legal process\"\nAnd the reply to that by the Chief of the Airforce dated the 27th of May 1997, is the next document and he gives the information with regards to the flight, the name of the navigator, the pilot, the passengers:\n\"Unfortunately no passenger list could be found.  The four or five passengers who were there were not known to them\"\nHe tells the type of flight and then he says:\n\"...[no English translation] because no reports were made for training and it was not available for this specific flight.  The co-ordinator cannot be determined.  As far as it can be established it was south of the Agulhas plateau about 150 sea miles from the coast.  Regarding the contents of the freight, the crew was not aware of the contents of the freight but it was ensured that it was safe for air travel.  It contained 20 blue plastic drums.  During the flight these bags were filled with some or other substance and when they landed this was taken from the aeroplane\"\nMr Chairman, I now come back to my statement, page 5:\n\"While the above took place I was also fully occupied in supporting the investigation of the Office of Serious Economic Offences and parallel investigations of the Office of the Auditor General into the possible financial abuses of the programme by Brigadier Basson and others.  In this regard Brigadier Basson was encouraged to cooperate with both the Office of Serious Economic Offences and the Auditor General in every respect\"\nIf I can interrupt myself I've provided many letters and documentation in this regard.  I was a State witness for the Office of OSEO.  If it's necessary I can make this available.\n\"With the appointment of Mr Coetzee as Minister of Defence in April '93, I was again instructed to brief the Minister with respect to Project Coast  although a full briefing only took place on the 10th of August 1993.  The Minister was given a copy of the 7th of January 1993 briefing to Minister Louw, as well as the confirmatory notes dated the 8th of January '93 on the 30th of April '93\"\nIf you look at the next Appendix, I'm not going to read it again, you've seen the document already, it's simply to show you, that is the actual document or a copy thereof of which I handed over to the Minister with my signature there.  We were getting so many Ministers following one another that it was becoming very difficult to keep them in the picture Mr Chairman, and all that we had chance to do at that stage was to give him this and say: \"Read it, you will get an idea what's been going on.  It's a whole description of the programme and it's a description of instructions given by Mr Louw in accordance with the State President's guidelines and at a later stage we will brief you fully about the project\".  I did at that time discuss with General Liebenberg, the need to bring the Minister up to date with the problems around Basson.  I'm coming back to my statement:\n\"Although I recommended that the position of Doctor Basson, with special reference to the Creation problem as well as the Auditor General and Office of Serious Economic Offences investigation should be discussed in detail with the Minister by the Chief of the South African Defence Force, General Liebenberg indicated that he did not think that this was necessary until after the Minister had been briefed fully on Project Coast.\n The Minister did however indicated to the Chief of the Defence Force, that the research on the water soluble, CR, should be reinvestigated and that he wanted to be briefed about that separately\"\nMr Chairman, he was referring to what he had read in the briefing that we had given to Mr Louw and the remarks that he made with regard to CR.\n\"Such a briefing did take place on the 22nd of June 1993 where Mr Coetzee approved that a demonstration model of the CR containing water cannon could be manufactured but that the Foam Project of CR, Foam Project, could be terminated.\n After the return of Brigadier Basson from Switzerland on the 2nd of July '93, a briefing was given to him to myself, Colonel Steyn, Mr Pierre Theron and Mr van Heerden of the Office of the Auditor General on the 6th of July '93, which outlined the events in Switzerland, the nature of the problem in Croatia and the fact that no funds had been recovered.  At this I insisted that the Minister be informed about all the above events immediately.\n At a discussion that followed on the 8th of July and later also on the 15th of July '93, the Minister was fully briefed by the Chief of the South African Defence Force, the Chief of Staff Finance and myself and handed a document drawn up by Brigadier Basson about the events in Croatia.  There documents as well as related documents obtained later are contained in Appendix G?\nMr Chairman, I don't propose to spend a lot of time on this document but basically Doctor Basson gives here the whole chronology of what had taken place in Croatia, how the transaction went wrong and how the money was lost, what efforts he did to try and obtain the money and also two documents that I'd received.  One by way of a letter from the agent that was involved here.  The letter I'd already received in May and secondly, an affidavit by the agent which was drawn up in Bonn in Germany and sent through to my by our Military Attache and that was the 13th of August, quiet a lot later, the next year.\n The point that I want to or the items that I want to draw your attention to is that a lot of what is being said here by Basson confirms the process that had taken place before, it confirms the fact that the Chief of the Defence Force said: \"You could go back and try and recover the funds\".  But the fact that I wanted to bring to the Minister's attention was, here were serious problems with regard to the financial management of the project.\n Now, back to my statement on page 6:\n\"All these events were obviously also brought to the attention of the Office of Serious Economic Offences by myself.  I now took the further initiative on insisting that the Minister be briefed fully about the past history and the status of Project Coast by myself and Colonel Ben Steyn as soon as possible and the briefing was finally given on the 10th of August.  This document is contained in Appendix H\"\n Again Mr Chairman, the document you will see looks very much like the document that we presented to Mr Louw, in terms of the background history and the phases and the development and where we stood, but basically I want to draw your attention to paragraph 31 which discusses again with the Minister the whole history about the incapacitating agents.  Paragraph 42, which again points out to Minister Coetzee as Minister, what had happened in the process of destruction of all the substances, including the incapacitating agents. \n And lastly paragraph 44:\n\"As soon as the last two projects, the water cannon and the data capture processes were completed, the final closure will be continued with\"\n If I may use this opportunity, you will see there's an Annexure.  The Annexure refers to all the front companies that was in existence and were established with the approval of the Minister and also deals with other companies.  And I just want to underline here what I testified last week:  Protechnic was not a front company.  As far as my knowledge was concerned, it was a private company and that is why it is mentioned like that on page 2, also to this Minister.\n If I may go back to my statement:\n\"After this briefing I privately requested the Minister to allow me to begin direct liaison with the National Intelligence Service, with regard to the Offices of Serious Economic Offences Investigation in general and the situation of Brigadier Basson in particular.  This I did because of the fact that I developed the distinct impression that my efforts to deal with the situation solely within the South African Defence Force was not clarifying issues adequately and I had been approached by Mr Mike Kennedy from National Intelligence Service with the request that this should be arranged if possible, as the National Intelligence Service was also busy with an investigation into the CBW programme, with special reference to the role of Doctor Basson emanating from the Steyn Report.  I also learnt later that National Intelligence Service had also approached the Minister in this regard\"\nMr Chairman, at that time the Minister of Defence was also the Minister responsible for National Intelligence.  \"With the approval of the Minister of Defence the Chief of Military Counter Intelligence, Major General Nieuwoudt and I briefed the Director General of National Intelligence Service, Mr Mike Louw and the Director of Counter Espionage, Mr Mike Kennedy on the 24th of September 1993.  At the briefing which took place in Cape Town I gave the full background on Project Coast and Doctor Basson's role in it and again emphasised the situation with respect to direct control over the operational activities of Doctor Basson.\n I also dealt briefly with the fact that there had been a number of Military Counter Intelligence investigations into Doctor Basson's activities to establish where he had abused the project for personal enrichment and indicated what had emerged in the Office of Serious Economic Offences investigation up to date.  This document is contained in Appendix I.\nYou will notice on the front page in my own handwriting on the top:\n\"Purpose to divide the research into Basson's activities from the objectives of the project.  This would give him the opportunity to provide answers himself as requested\"\n That I think is an important aspect.  If you look at the document, the document deals again with the entire background, the phases, the developments, the processes that were followed, the decisions by the State President and the Cabinet Committee, the development of incapacitating agents, the destruction thereof, the development of CR, where we stood with that.  And then finally, all of this is really what we said before Mr Chairman, finally, if I take you to page 11, we then spoke about the position of Doctor Basson.  I wrote the following:\n\"Brigadier Basson was appointed in the South African Defence Force on the 2nd of January 1979 as a Medical Officer and he was a Lieutenant.  He was used at Military Hospital from the 2nd of January till the 28th of February 1981.  During this time he followed various medical services and became a first specialist in internal medicine.  He had this rank since 1980.  His military rank was a substantive Commander.  As from March 1981, he served as a specialist advisor at headquarters and as Project Officer for the Special Projects for the Surgeon General and was added to the Special Forces headquarters under the operational command of the Commanding Officer Special Forces of the Defence Force.  As from the 1st of January 1985, he had the rank of Colonel and he became head of a new division, the 7th Medical Battalion.  It provided medical support to Special Forces and the paratroopers and the South African Police and the NIS.  In this capacity he undergoes various courses and became a Brigadier in 1988 and became the head of Medical Staff Operations.  In this post he remained for nine months till I appointed him as the Director General responsible for Research and Development in the South African Medical Services.  Based on an instruction by the State President in December '92, he was placed on compulsory leave and he was placed on pension as from the 31st of March 1993\"\nAnd then a little lower down, in terms of his involvement with the project:\n\"49, the CMC was the controlling body of Project Coast.  Decisions regarding the type of activities and products was taken by the CMC\"\n Pointing out again that at that level it was a broad guideline, the detailed research development was done at the level of the technical work group of which Basson was the chairperson.\n Now page 13:\n\"Particulars regarding control over Brigadier Basson.  Brigadier Basson, since his appointment in the South African Defence Force, was under the functional control of the Surgeon General and had to report to the Surgeon General, but as I've indicated previously he was under the operational control of the Commanding Officer Special Forces and all his military activities were controlled by this instance.  Since the 1st of March 1988 I had personal control over Brigadier Basson and confirmed this with his appointment as the Director for Research and Development at headquarters on the 1st of October 1988.  Regarding this project, Brigadier Basson was responsible to the CMC for the operation and management of this project and his activities were authorised by this body.  The situation regarding the operational application of the product delivered by this project was different and his activities were authorised by the person who gave the instructions.  These people were the Minister of Defence, the Head of the South African Defence Force, the Commanding Officer Special Tasks, the Head of Staff Intelligence, the Commissioner of the South African Police, the Commanding General of the South African Police and the Director General National Intelligence Services\"\nIn other words Mr Chairman, I have repeated here to National Intelligence, exactly what I had said earlier on to the Office of Serious Economic Offences.  I say again:\n\"The abovementioned state of affairs was not acceptable for me and I lodged my complaint to General Geldenhuys.  They took cognisance of this but it continued, this practice.  In the cases were Brigadier Basson was tasked operationally by the abovementioned people, they took notice of Project Coast.  The last was then regarded by CMC as part of the total programme and it was approved\"\nThen I have a short paragraph on:\n\"Research into Basson's activities:  During the past two years, because of various allegations and questions and Counter Intelligence reports, the investigations were conducted into Basson.  It usually had to do with suspicions that Basson enriched himself to the detriment of the State.  In-depth investigations by the staff of various of senior people, in conjunction with the Auditor General was done without any proof being found.   During December '92 an investigation concerning Section 5 of Act into Serious Economic Offences was undertaken by OSEO.  On the 8th of December I was asked to comment on certain questions regarding the person of Doctor Basson and written answers were given to OSEO\"\nThis is the document that I referred to earlier in one of my Appendices where you saw the answer that I gave to OSEO.  And then under final comments, if you will allow me, at page 15, paragraph 59:\n\"I want to indicate once again that the present State President said on the 26th of March ...[indistinct] in the presence of General Malan, Geldenhuys, Liebenberg and myself ...[indistinct]\"\nI'm not going to read it all, you've heard it before Mr Chairman.  I repeat exactly what I said before, not only to the Defence Command Council but also to the Minister, I have now repeated to National Intelligence.  And finally I say in 62:\n\"I propose that Brigadier Basson in the future must be given the opportunity to answer any questions regarding his person to personally answer to NIS.  If possible or where necessary I will assist him in that regard\"\nAnd I also add the same Appendix with the front companies and the other companies.  That brings me to page 7:\n\"Because I believed that it would help me to finalise the Office of Serious Economic Offences investigation and moreover give Doctor Basson the opportunity to clarify his position in terms of the decision of the State President, that he should be put on early pension, I recommended that Doctor Basson be given the opportunity to cooperate fully with National Intelligence Service\"\nAnd then I say in brackets:\n\"(it must be borne in mind that he had consistently indicated to me that he was not guilty of any misconduct, either within the project or in any other capacity.  He further said that he was being confused with other persons also known as W Basson.\n At this stage I had no concrete reason to doubt his word).  Mr Mike Kennedy then indicated to me that National Intelligence Service was in fact investigating issues far beyond the scope of the Office of Serious Economic Offences investigation and that they also believed that Doctor Basson would able to clarify some of the outstanding issued in their investigation.  After the briefing\"\n...[intervention]  May I interrupt myself Mr Chairman? You must understand that at this stage Doctor Basson is on the Citizen Force Reserve, he's in a voluntary position helping us to conclude issues around the project and I had to deal with him fairly delicately at the time.\n\"After the briefing I persuaded Doctor Basson to cooperate fully with Mr Mike Kennedy personally as I believed that this would finally give him the opportunity to clear his name\"\nIt took quite a bit of time to persuade him to cooperate but he did.\n\"To the best of my knowledge a number of discussions did take place between Doctor Basson and Mr Mike Kennedy, the results of which only became known to me in February '94\"\nI will came back to that point just now.\n\"It was at about this time that I was requested by Mr Meyer to see Doctor Jan Lourens in connection with some concerns that he had had in relation to the project.  As he testified to the Commission, he did to the best of my recollection, mention the fact that he had been requested by Doctor Basson to manufacture various instruments or gadgets during the time that he was working at SRD, later to become Protechnic.  It is further true that I  indicated that I had not known about this and did in fact not want to know about this as I believed that it had nothing to do with Project Coast\"\nAnd if I may just explain Mr Chairman.  SRD was founded early in the '80's when I wasn't even the Surgeon General and I was really not aware whether it had gone on there and I was convinced that these activities were outside the project.  However, I didn't leave it there.  May I just read what I said further?\n\"It is further true that I indicated that I had not known about this and did not\"\nSorry, I've read that already:\n\"He then indicated to me that he had in fact been confronted at a social function of the special forces of the South African Defence Force by General Liebenberg with a remark to the effect that he, Lourens should look after his, Liebenberg's toys carefully\"\nI believe he testified that as well last week.\n\"I then advised him to bring this to the attention of the authorities that were investigating such allegations and to give the facts as he knew it\"\nWhat I meant by that is that he should go to the d'Oliveira Commission and give them the information.\n\"I informed General Liebenberg\"\nAs I testified last week.\n\"I informed General Liebenberg about the incident without disclosing to him that Doctor Lourens had in fact referred to him directly, to which he gave what was now his standard answer, namely that the d'Oliveira investigation had dealt with these types of allegations and had up to date not acted against any person on the basis of information contained in the Steyn Report\"\nThis was in the middle of October to the best of my recollection.\n\"General Liebenberg retired as Chief of South African Defence Force on the 31st of October 1993 and was succeeded by General Meiring as Chief of the Army.  From 28th of February 1990 up to the 31st of October '93, General Meiring was a member of the Co-ordinating Management Committee and familiar with the major developments in the project.  Certainly I did not have to brief him extensively about the programme and the process of privatisation and commercialisation as approved by the relevant Ministers and the State President before and in any case he had available the Chief of Staff Finance, Vice Admiral Murray and later Lieutenant General Raubenheimer, Chief of Staff Intelligence, Lieutenant General van der Westhuizen, later Lieutenant General Verbeuk and Chief of Staff Logistics, Vice Admiral Malherbe, to bring him up to date in details in this regard\"\n You must remember Mr Chairman, the Chief of the Defence Force is the Chief Accounting Officer and is accountable to Parliament with regard to all funds, also funds that are coming out of the special defence account and this is why I mention this specifically, that he as the new Chief of the Defence Force appointed in November, would have to prepare himself to appear in front of the Parliamentary Committee in February of the following year.\n\"Furthermore, his main role in the Co-ordinating Management Committee was to help me finalise a number of issues before the final termination of a project.  These issues are clearly documented in the last four Co-ordinating Management Committee meetings which he chaired on the 24th of January 1994, 29th of March '94, 2nd December '94 and the 9th of January '95.  These documents and other relevant documents are contained in Appendix J\"\n Mr Chairman, I'm almost through but they are important.  In this document I use not only the minutes of the Co-ordinating Management Committee but also two other documents which have relevance and which appear in the minutes as well.  You will see that on the 22nd of March 1994, this is quite a bit later, I received a letter from Viljoen, French and Couter on behalf of Mr Brand from Organochem, with regard to the fact that this client of theirs had not been paid for the support he'd given the Defence Force with regard to the Baxil Project.  There's details about the sum of money that he was supposed to have been paid for it.  \n If we now go to the minutes of the Management Committees that was cheered by General Meiring, the first one on the 29th of March and we just scan it Mr Chairman.  It indicates that the destruction was completed, that the data process was going on, the water cannon process was going on.  It is really confirmation of everything that I said before.  It ...[indistinct] a section where I'd recommended that Protechnic as the private company should be taken over by Armscor and where we stand with that and there's nothing really much to be concerned of.\n If you look the next one over, on the 2nd of December 1994 under:\n\"Outstanding claims\"\nParagraph 2:\n\"G Brand, Brigadier Basson gives the background of this claim regarding R350 000.  It's decided that this claim should be paid but that R250 000 would be a reasonable amount\"\n What had happened there Mr Chairman is that Brigadier Basson was called to this specific meeting to come and explain why we have now received a letter from an attorney about a claim that should have been paid more than two years before.  \n If we then go to the next meeting on the 24th of January '94 - no, I beg your pardon, I've got them in the wrong order now, I've read that one.  On the 9th of January '95, again a short description of what had happened.  If you look at page 2, paragraph 10:\n\"Brand gives a motivation why he thinks the full claim should be paid and it should be paid according to standards, all his costs and R60 per hour seeing that it was an accepted formula.  Brigadier Basson should calculate all these\"\nNow I want to refer you to the other document which is also a document in the possession of the TRC.\n\"At the discussion of the previous meeting when it was suggested that he should be paid only R250 000 although the agreement was R350 000, I questioned it and the discussion led us to ask Brigadier Basson to obtain for us a detailed description of what Brand had in fact given the Defence Force, what formula did he give us, was it of any value\"\nThe document that you have in front of you is dated the 24th of November '94:\n\"Claim by Mr Branch for Technical Aid\"\nThere is a description of the dealings with Mr Brand, what he had given to us, what the agreed sum of money was that we would have to pay him and added to it is a document signed by Doctor Koekemoer who testified here last week, and he then does an analysis of the scientific synthetic process that was followed.  And this certainly I will not be able to read as clearly to you as Professor Folb would, but again to help the Co-ordinating Management Committee to decide whether this was really in fact a valuable contribution made by Mr Brand.  And you will see if you look at the first document dated 24 November, Doctor Basson writes the following in paragraph 4:\n\"According to Doctor Koekemoer's calculations, the raw materials costs for the \"safrool\" part was R1,927.00 against the R326.34 for \"die glediese ester part\", a savings of R1.600.00 per kilogram was achieved.  It should be taken into consideration that there was an amount of 1000 kilogram's end product delivered, the total savings in raw material for the clycerium provided by Mr Brand is 1.6 million rand\"\nThis was then presented at this meeting of the CMC on the 9th of January and it was then decided to pay him according to what is recorded here in the minutes.  But it also confirms the production process that was followed with Baxil, as testified to by Doctor Koekemoer and as delivered according to his testimony, early in January '93.\n Now I want to come back to my statement.  I had just been telling you what General Meiring's role was and how he chaired the meetings and the decisions he had to take there and how he had to help me with the privatisation and commercialisation and final termination of the project.  What I now say is the following:\n\"What is important however is that I shared my alarm about the position of Doctor Basson with him and brought him fully into the picture with regard to my co-operation with Mr Mike Kennedy of the National Intelligence Service.  In this regard I arranged for a number of meetings between myself or rather between himself, myself and Mr Mike Kennedy during the following year to ensure that he would be fully informed of any new developments with respect to Doctor Basson\"\nThis brings us towards the end of 1993.\n\"Towards the end of 1993, the National Intelligence Service received information that the United States of America and the United Kingdom Governments were preparing to challenge South Africa's confidence building declaration, so-called CBM declaration, in terms of the Biological Weapons Convention at the United Nations and that the USA and UK ambassadors were being prepared by their respective governments to deliver a joint demarche to State President de Klerk.\n At the time the Department of Foreign Affairs who dealt with the CBM declaration at the United Nations on behalf of the SADF and the South African Government, indicated that they were going to submit a similar declaration to the 1993 declaration.  In essence the 1993 declaration referred to a defensive biological weapons programme which according to USA/UK submission to Mr de Klerk, was incorrect or incomplete.\n During February '94, the State President was briefed by Mr Louw, Doctor Scholtz and Mr Kennedy of the National Intelligence Service, on South Africa's CBW Programme and alleged abuses, with particular reference to the so-called: \"unofficial programme\".  \nThis is their terminology.\n\"A week later the briefing was repeated to the Minister of Defence and myself.  I again confirmed that I was totally unaware of any so-called: \"unofficial programme\" or alleged third force abuses.  I further indicated that if there had in fact been abuse of the programme in the form of third force activities by Brigadier Basson and/or members of 7th Medical Battalion group, it was either on their own initiative or through a second channel of command and control\"\nNow if I may interrupt myself Mr Chairman, I think with the wisdom of hindsight, at this point I was finally convinced that there was a serious problem, not only on the financial abusive side but certainly also on other activities. \n\"The process that followed hereafter is described in great detail in the Project Cloud Report of the National Intelligence Agency and will not be outlined here\"\nMr Chairman, I am prepared to take you through 211 pages of this report, however I don't think we have the time and I think the members of the Commission have read it and I would seriously ask them to read it very carefully to see exactly what the process was and the chronology.",

            "We appreciate that General.\n\"Suffice to say, that after the briefing given to the Minister of Defence and myself by Mr Louw, Doctor Scholtz and Mr Mike Kennedy during February '94, it was abundantly clear to both the Minister and myself that there were definite indications that Doctor Basson had acted outside the mandate of the project and had probably abused capabilities that had been researched and developed in the project.\n This impression was further strengthened by the detailed document of the United States and the UK Governments, dated the 11th of April as contained in the Cloud Report and of which I was given a copy on the 12th of April '94 to prepare comments for the State President.  My full comment is also contained in the Cloud Report dated the 15th of April.\nAnd that is my Appendix K which is now the Cloud Report, but this is a document which I believe to be one of the documents in the bundle of the TRC and again if you study that document, if this document is studied by the TRC, it will reveal exactly what my knowledge and impressions were at the time.\n\"Furthermore, at that point my views were shared with the Chief of the National Defence Force, the Minister of Defence and the State President, as well as with Doctor Scholtz and Mr Mike Kennedy.  After a discussion of my comment as well as inputs given by the Minister and the National Intelligence Agency, it was my impression that the main priority at stake was to deal with demarche with the USA and the UK primarily from the point of view of what would be in the best interest of the Republic of South Africa and to deal with the issue of abuses and possible criminal activities internally,  through the already established Commissions of Inquiry and Investigations.  This is also clearly visible in the follow-up process as contained in the Project Cloud Report\"\nAnd I see:  see Appendix K, pages 45 to 103.  \n\"My own personal role and further activities from then on are clearly and accurately reflected in the Cloud Report and I am prepared to discuss any aspect thereof if so required\"\nThat is from page 103 to page 211.\n\"Finally I would like to confirm again, that at no time prior to the events that led up to the day marsh with the USA and the UK in '93, did I have any knowledge of so-called third force activities carried out by members of the South African Medical Service under my command or by any person or persons associated with or involved in Project Coast or any of its front companies or private companies utilised in its programme\"",

I agree with you that it would have been wiser now looking back to insist that there should be a board of enquiry as I explained right at the beginning of my testimony. All members in the medical service are not only under the disciplinary code but also under the professional code of conduct of the medical or other professions that they are registered with.

This is what the field workers of the Intelligence community thinks about the Defence Force and then particularly here with regard to Project Jotta. This is what they have picked up on the ground from sources and from discussions that they have heard. This gives us an idea of whether security is being breached or not.

He was arrested, he incurred some expenses in terms of his arrest. The Defence Force took responsibility for all those expenses and for his legal support, etc that was given to him. He was asked to put in front of the CMC, in fact in front of the Chief of Defence Force the expenses that he has incurred and then he was reimbursed after it was properly evaluated by the Chief of Staff Finance.

And where you have to do management services you have no choice other than to rely on experts in a particular field. I do that exactly as I think this Commission operates. This Commission and the Commissioners have to rely on their experts and their field workers to advise them and to guide them. It would be totally impossible for an organisation like the medical service to have at its head somebody who can deal with everyone of the issues on his own personal basis. It is not possible.\n So what I am saying to you is here is a man who became a brigadier at a very young age just before I became Surgeon-General. He obviously had the trust of the entire Defence Force and of the Cabinet because that type of appointment is approved at that kind of level. He had the total support of my predecessor. The system that was created to run this project and the way that he had operated was then running already for 8 years when I took over. It is quite impossible to then begin to question the way that he carries out his dealings. His word was accepted. I say that and it is true. His word was accepted not only by me but also by the co-ordinating management committee. \n I said to you although I was project manager the control over the project was done by a committee. Whether it was wise or not I don't know. But the committee shared the responsibility. The Chief of the Defence Force was the chairman of the committee and it had three sub-committees. The one was designed to look after security. The second one was designed to look after financial affairs and the third one was the sub-committee of which Brigadier Basson was the chairman that was the technical committee that dealt with the actual research and development at grassroots level or ground floor level.",

And I do not know whether that exercise has been gone into and what the outcome thereof is.\n Secondly you indicated that new evidence was brought in this morning in the form of documentation from General Knobel that it was your view that in order to do justice to your case you might need some time to look at that document. I don't know how far you have gone.\n We have a time problem. There is a scheduled meeting of the Commission at half past two that is intending to look at a wide range of issues including issues that deal with the final report. I think arrangements have been made with a number of Commissioners to be present and I have seen some that are present. So I don't know how long you were expecting to be with Dr Knobel. But I was not hoping to be here later than half past two. At the very worst quarter to three. So I need to know where we move from here. I do not know what the position is with regard to Dr Wouter Basson. What the position is to Dr Mijburgh and whether you still need to call further evidence in the event those two are going to testify or one of them is going to testify. So I need to be guided by you but I have already indicated what my own time constraints are and I am speaking on behalf of the panel when I say so. It has nothing to do with any other events which are of a national interest today.",

The documents that my learned friend, Advocate Arendse and I were supposed to go through are the very same documents which were presented to us by Dr Knobel this morning. It will not be possible for us to have gone through all those documents. So we will have to do it at some stage. Which leads me up to the next point that in view of these new documents and we may have to ask some questions pertaining to those documents that we may have to recall General Knobel to another day where we can go through these documents with him. If that is going to be agreeable then we can get as far as we can by half past two and if necessary we can then postpone this hearing.\n It will also be necessary to call Dr Mijburgh. We have just had an indication for the very first time that he has now agreed that he will give evidence. So what we could do is co-ordinate with the various legal representatives suitable dates and then we can complete with General Knobel, deal with Dr Mijburgh also on that date.

I did as you have noticed this morning in my statement try to indicate where the information is contained in what I called appendix K which is the Operation Cloud report. And I steered away deliberately from dealing with it point by point. It was before you arrived that I was going through some of the other documents.

            "DANIEL PETER KNOBEL",
            "Well Mr Vally in the case of this project is was reasonably clearly conveyed to me by my predecessor and it is also contained in some of the documents that have been made available including the briefing that I gave to the TRC initially. I think I did testify the previous round of testimony that the problem that you have with such a project it is a very complexed project. It has lots of technical aspects. It has complexed financial arrangements. It has very complexed security arrangements. And this necessitated in this case that the project was managed by a committee with all due respect a committee is not always the best structure to control any project. However in this case it meant that the chairman of the co-ordinating management committee who was the Chief of the Defence Force like the vice-chairman who was a certain General who was also the responsible functionary because the project officer came out of the medical service. And because the medical service as an independent arm was chosen to deal with the scientists and deal with the subject matter, namely chemical and biological defence.\n Both those functionaries, the chairman and vice-chairman was totally dependent on the sub-committees that existed within the co-ordinating management committee. Which meant a division of responsibilities and the position of the project manager was to try and co-ordinate those functions and bring them together. \n But I stress again on the financial side the complexity of the front companies and how you structure their financial arrangements and how do you structure the payment of accounts overseas in such a way that it cannot be traced back to the client which is the Defence Force was to a very large extent planned and approved and suggested and controlled by Chief of Staff Finance. And in particular the name came out this morning on that document Brigadier Koertzen who is very familiar with the arrangement of such financial arrangements where you have to transfer money overseas and then allow it to flow to different accounts so that it cannot be traced back and so on.\n On the security side the same situation arose where the Chief of Staff Intelligence through his sub-structures would look after the security arrangements in such a way likewise that neither the project officer nor the project nor the Defence Force is compromised or in any way revealed in transactions that take place. Which is after all as came out clearly this morning transactions which are geared to overcome the situation of isolation and sanctions and all that sort of thing.\n I think the third sub-committee I think has become clear to you all which is really the technical committee. The research development at grassroots level. The handling of the scientists, the co-ordination of their activities and also keeping it apart, keeping it separate, that was the direct responsibility of the Project Officer.\n In the co-ordination role of the Project Manger, it was to ensure and to represent to the Chief of the Defence Force that all three these functions were brought together in budgetary allocations in presentations of the kind that I've been making to all the various Ministers and all the various parliamentary groups, etc., etc., and to do so with total reliance on those three sub-structures.  \n You are correct if you say that the details contained within those presentations or briefings that refer to the scientific or the technical aspects, that had to be provided by the Project Officer.  The privatisation, commercialisation phase, all of that was planned by the Project Officer in conjunction with the Chief of Finance at that time, considering the various company regulations that existed and that is why, you will have noticed, that is why all the documents of financial transactions have had to be kept and they were kept, none were destroyed as far as I'm aware of.  Those are the 14 trunks that I've referred to before.  \n The Company Act provides that you cannot destroy that, whereas other documents in terms of regulations within the Defence Force and in terms of directions that we got either from the Chief of the Defence Force or from the Minister were in fact destroyed or so, that's my information.  It certainly is a bit frustrating that  you don't have that type of information available today.\n Certainly, when I took over and when I became aware of the financial problems I started keeping every single document that was under my control because I realised the important of, for example the support of the OSEO investigation.  \n At the same time I have to admit to you, the issue of privatisation and commercialisation and whether it was in the best interest of the country and whether it was a reasonable way of doing it, if you look at it today you might think that it was not a very good way of structuring that whole process but the fact of the matter was, at the time with the security constraints, with the guidelines that we had from our own Minister at the time and the fact that the Auditor General was closely involved in the whole negotiating process about how that process should be structured, the State Attorneys were involved in that and ultimately the Minister of Finance approved it along with the Minister of Defence.  \n Quite frankly it was so complex that I was not capable of dealing with that on my own and I had to rely totally on Chief of Staff Finance.  To what extent the Project Officer had understanding and influence and control over that, I can really not tell you.  I think it was really the Chief of Staff Finances structure, how it should take place.\n It was so complex that even today at the request of the Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts, the Joint Standing Committee, that have asked questions about that process, the answer to that as far as I know has not yet been provided for the Standing Committee.  It was given to the Auditor General to investigate and to take statements from everybody that was involved right from the beginning of the project.  In other words, they go back to Admiral Becker who was the First Chief of Staff Finance involved in the project, followed by Admiral Murray, followed by General Raubenheimer etc., etc.\n One of the difficulties is if you look at the, my notes, I can provide them if you want me to, if you look at the changeover in the positions of the members of the Co-ordinating Management Committee, we are now talking of about 25 individuals.  The Co-ordinating Management Committee consisted as I've said many times now, of the Chief of the Defence Force, the Surgeon General, Chief of Staff Finance, Chief of Staff Intelligence, Chief of the Army, later on the Commanding General Special Forces and later on the Chief of Staff Planning and so on.\n If you take the incumbents of those posts, from 1981 onwards we're talking about 25 different people and to preserve continuity within that as Project Manager, first of all my predecessor for the first eight years of the project and then myself for what turned out to be the next five years of the project, is extremely difficult and also to change a system which is working and which is producing results and giving what we're aiming to try and achieve through the objectives is virtually impossible.  You inherit a system that is working, that everybody is satisfied with it, with its shortcomings and to come in as a newcomer and now say that: \"I'm not satisfied with this process, I want to reverse the whole process or change it or I want to re-evaluate it and so on\", that I think is not possible.\n And I must say that this is one of the issues which to me became very difficult to handle and that is what I tried to explain this morning in my statement when I said that I found I could not really achieve the results and the answers that I wanted to achieve within the Defence Force alone.  I thought I had to get the permission to move outside.  I had already had the permission to work as closely as possible with the OSEO investigation and I did.  I have spent five years now giving documents and giving inputs at the OSEO investigation.  I'm the State witness for their entire case at this stage against Doctor Basson.\n I believe there are going to be more charges at a later stage and I will still take part in that entire process.  But at the same time the second component which I described this morning as being the second channel of command and control or what was described by National Intelligence as the unofficial programme, that as it emerged in the end of '92 if you like, and in as far as I am concerned the end of '93 with the demarche, that has resulted in an investigation mainly by National Intelligence but certainly by the Attorney General's office, in which I'm very closely involved and which in exactly the same way all these sort of documents that you are showing to me and other documents that have been found in the trunks and other documents that are official documents still today in the Defence Force, even the documents that are in the archives, are brought up and we look at them and we decide together where we can give comment on it.\n Likewise, there I'm very limited.  The fact that I'm limited is the fact that I wasn't involved in it to begin with until the realisation occurred in '93 and since then Mr Kennedy and I have been working absolutely together in every possible way in every respect and this is why my suggestion to the Commission was that it would be extremely important for the Commission to listen to the evidence of Mr Kennedy.",
