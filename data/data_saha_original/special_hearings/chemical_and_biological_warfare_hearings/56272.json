Mr Chairman, we've indicated yesterday to Mr Chaskalson that, I don't want to use the word: \"object\", but we would put a request to you regarding Doctor Wouter Basson's evidence, the view of the pending criminal case.  And the basis for that, the basis is Mr Chairman, that at this stage he is being forced by legislation to give evidence about a matter related to his pending criminal case and the charges against him and consequently he has a right to keep silent according to the Constitution and he must not be pressurised to show his hand at this stage.\n Yesterday you saw that we've received a note from the Attorney General regarding the various charges against Doctor Basson.  This was done by Doctor D'Oliveira's investigative team.  This is also a charge regarding conspiracy.  We will argue this in detail and will refer to the necessary authority.  \n At this stage I want to mention that we discussed this with Mr Vally yesterday and I and Mr Cilliers, we together appear for Mr Basson, and Mr Vally felt that the correct time to pose argument is when Mr Basson is supposed to give evidence.  Mr Vally said that perhaps they could do it earlier but Mr Cilliers is not available today.  I cleared with Mr Vally before these proceedings.  He is still doing research about this matter.  We haven't made a final decision.  He will be back this afternoon.  He's available tomorrow morning and I think we will be in a position to argue the matter.

Doctor Mijburgh told me that he had obtained an official order from the Surgeon General for this compound and that it was envisaged that it would be used as potential incapacitant.  So in order to try and remain on the legal side where this was concerned, I and Mr van der Spuy actually went to see Doctor Lothar Neethling in this regard.  We had a discussion with Neethling concerning this.  \n Neethling was, during that meeting, very non-committal concerning this so-called Baxol Project, which was MDMA Hydrochloride but he started arguing, he asked me what chemistry I envisaged and so on and we argued about the chemistry and from our discussion I deduced that we had his tacit approval although he didn't want to commit himself to this project.\n I then went back and eventually developed quite a novel process for making MDMA Hydrochloride.  This was implemented on plant scale and materials, the pure materials, and it was very high purity, it was 99.5% plus pure material, was delivered by myself over a period from the 4th of February 1992 to about the 5th of January 1993, to Doctor Mijburgh's offices at Henopsmeer, that is Medchem Consolidated Investments.\n Apparently the delivery notes were made out to Kowolsky International.

Nothing was said of an incriminating nature against my clients and that's why I do not have any questions to ask at this moment.  Regarding my clients, should there be incriminating things, my point of view is still the same regarding all the witnesses that not one of my clients were giving notice of factual incriminating evidence here.  I can give you the assurance that we will not ask people to recall witnesses, but I can't give up the rights of my clients.  This person only testified today but I can give you the assurance we do not want to call witnesses back if it is not necessary.",
