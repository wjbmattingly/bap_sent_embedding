He said to us we should go the kitchen.  We did as we were told, we went into the kitchen. When we arrived in the kitchen there were two groups.  On the other side it was a group of those who stayed with us in the house and on the other side it was a group.\n I did not know them - these people, I only knew two people from that group.  If I still remember well, it was Xoliswa Falati and Nompumelelo.  Among these people there was a person wearing a khaki overall. He asked a question to Xoliswa Falati, who they are, and Xoliswa Falati started mentioning our names. She said: \"It's Pelo, Thabiso, Stompie\", and Kenny was mentioned also.  She said Kenny was too clever and he can't just be left behind. \n And thereafter they said we should leave with them.  We left with them. When we were outside they took us into the bus that was parked just further down the road.  There was singing in this bus. We were told not to sit down, we should sin. Then we joined in the singing and the bus started moving.  This bus drove until at a certain house in Diepkloof - that I learnt later.

In that room we heard the reason for us to be fetched.  \n Slash started by asking Stompie: \"Stompie, why are you an informer, why are you selling out our people\"?  Stompie tried to explain to Slash that: \"I've never sold any people to anybody\". He asked him: \"Where did I sell the people\"?  Slash said to him: \"In Parys\".   Stompie said: \"Who are these people that you allege I have sold out?\"  Slash said: \"Three members of the MK\".  \n Stompie said: \"I do not know anything to that effect, I do not even know the people you are talking of\". He referred him to me because I knew Stompie from Parys, and I understood Stompie very well.  We used to go to Potchefstroom with him when there were funerals. We would be together and meet there.  What Slash was alleging I did not even know, I even asked him myself: \"Who are those people, I do not even remember the names that you have just mentioned.  I don't remember of  any three MK members who were arrested in Parys because of Stompie.  I do not believe that Stompie was ever an impimpi because he was very young at that time\". \n I said: \"He might have taken out names because he was assaulted\".

Even that relevance seems to us to have disappeared, or at least to have been substantially diluted, because those who made the allegations have all retracted them.  But the witness nonetheless wishes to have an opportunity to deal with that issue. \n   There are broader issues, however, you might enquire - he might be asked whether he'd ever molested anybody else, whether he'd ever engaged in sexual activity with any other people.  He might be asked about his sexual orientation. He's willing to give that evidence if it were relevant and helpful to your enquiry at all.

He was going away on holiday, and apparently had consulted with the community of Tumahole about where Stompie could be placed, and ultimately the decision was made that he be sent to my house.\n I haven't got the sequence of events completely correct, but I did have a meeting with the leadership of that township at one stage because these allegations had started raising themselves, and I was told that that was precisely the reason that they had sent him to my house, because they felt it would be a safe place for him.   Now what I haven't got clearly in my mind is whether that happened before what I'm going to tell you now or after.\n But I returned home one evening and there was a gathering in the kitchen, and Stompie was being interrogated. That's the way I interpreted what was going on.  He was sitting with his hands [Tape ends] ... didn't take any time with that. I immediately intervened and called Mrs Falati out and said that under no circumstances did I want my mission house to become what was happening in every police station. \n And that if there was any chance Stompie was an informant, then we needed to clearly understand two things: if he gave information under torture it was understood, I thought, by most of the people of the movement at that stage that you were not expected to hold out against the odds, and particularly for what really was a child - number one.  And number two that if the police had decided to make anybody an informant, there was absolutely nothing you could do about it. They could arrange matters so that you could look as if you were an informant, and there would be nothing that you could do about it.

You see, if you spread propaganda of that sort, that we go so far as to kidnap children to compel them to join Umkhonto, what could be more damaging to the community than that\"?\nShe goes on to say:\n\"We do not abduct children to compel them to join Umkhonto weSizwe, it's purely voluntary on the part of those youths who do not leave the country to join the military forces of the ANC, and that is what is being said.

            "Well, again this is - I have to emphasise - I as yet did not know about this abduction, so this is what was reported to me, but that David Ching, one of the staff members of the Central Methodist Mission telephoned Reverend Paul Verryn to say that Kenny Kgase - now Kenny Kgase had a link with the Central Methodist Mission, he was a semi-staff member there and did some work there and earned a little bit of money that way -  that he had arrived in a bad physical state, and Paul apparently went to meet with him and his first question to Paul Verryn was: \"Where is Stompie\"?  And then he told Paul that he was very traumatised and one of the things which he blurted out was: \"We are being trained to kill\".  Paul Verryn then met with his Superintendent Minister, the Reverend Otto Mbambula, who indicated that he had been engaged with the Reverend Sizwe Mbabane in some discussions with community leaders since the 2nd of January about this issue.\n Paul then took Kenny Kgase to the doctor because of his head injuries. He was x-rayed and it seemed that no serious damage was diagnosed, although he was still having trouble with his eyesight and there were other problems.  Kenny was then taken to Mr Geoff Budlander, a lawyer and he made a statement, and Mr Budlander placed very strong conditions on how that statement might ever be used.\n And then on Monday the 9th, I was told of the situation and began to enter into the dialogue about how we could handle it.  And I first got a full report from the Reverend Paul Verryn as to what he knew and what he could tell me about Kenny's return and the report that Kenny had made.  And then on the 11th of January I was called by the Reverend Frank Chikane, who said that the community was deeply concerned about what would happen, and a Crisis Committee was taking up the matter with Mrs Mandela, and would be seeing her that morning.  \n And he was asking that the church and the community leaders co-operate very closely in this matter.  And I agreed with that. I recognised the sensitivity of it all and it was quite clear that we would need to work with and through community leaders to try and obtain the release of these youths.",

On Thursday the 12th, he reported to me that he and Aubrey Mokoena and Sister Bernard Ncube and Sydney Mufamadi had visited Mrs Mandela on the 11th.  She had told them that she was protecting these youths and that they were not abducted, they were there of their request.\n Initially she agreed that they could have access to these youths immediately, but she had changed her mind and told them to come back later in the day.  Mr Chikane also at that time spoke to me about serious concerns he had for Paul Verryn's safety.  He said, and I quote: \" The football team members are ruthless and well armed\" unquote.  Now the Crisis Team then returned in the afternoon of Wednesday the 11th, this time without Mr Chikane, and I think it's because he was going overseas - I seem to remember that he had a trip and had to catch a plane. \n When they came in the afternoon, Zinzi Mandela, who was there in the house, indicated to them that one of the youths had quote \"escaped\" unquote, and they regarded that statement as being fairly significant because of the implications of the word \"escaped\", if you apply it to people who are there of their own free will.  They chose to ignore this remark but they noted it.  \n When the access was granted to the youths, they noted that Pelo and Thabiso had fresh wounds on their bodies, that Katiza  did not.  All three youths maintained that they were there of their own free will, that they had been subjected to sexual advances by Paul Verryn.  \n However, one of these youths at some point - according to the report I received from Mokoena, Ncube and Mufamadi - found himself alone with them, and he broke down under questioning and admitted that they were being held against their will and that they had been told to tell the story about the sexual advances.  He said, I quote: \"I'm going to die anyway, so I may as well tell the truth\" unquote.  Now, it seems that that was Katiza.\n The group then left the children there and gave no indication that any one of them had broken down, for fear of their safety.  What they were really concerned about now was Stompie, knowing that if only one of the youths had quote \"escaped\" unquote, it must have been Kenny Kgase, so where was Stompie?  Chikane said he was leaving for Europe and he indicated that he would contact Oliver Tambo and that Mr Nelson Mandela was also to be contacted and shown written statements about this abduction, which were prepared by the remaining residents of Paul Verryn's house. Those who had remained in Verryn's house, in the church house, had in fact put together a statement about what happened on the night of the abduction.  Then I - Frank Chikane asked me if I could make Paul Verryn available that same afternoon of the 12th of January to meet with the Crisis Committee to answer some questions which they wanted to ask of him, related particularly, I think, to the allegations of his sexual misconduct.",

Their reply was that nothing substantial was said in this regard except in the case of Katiza, who referred to Paul rubbing against him.

It is possible I say, that in this meeting he also conveyed a message from Oliver Tambo to release the children, because we'd been working with Mr Tambo to get such a message and we know that one did come.\n Mrs Mandela repeated to Mr Ayob her allegations about Paul Verryn, and he said: \"Well, if theses allegations are true, then let me take the children to Bishop Storey where they can make these accusations to Mr Verryn's Bishop\".  She agreed at first - according to Mr Ayob - but then she called in Xoliswa Falati, and said that Xoliswa must accompany the youths to see me.  Then she changed her mind again - according to Mr Ayob - and said that I must come myself, I must come to her home on Saturday the 14th.\n Now I received that message at about 10 o'clock, she wanted to see me at 11.30 on Saturday the 14th.

I wanted to contact the community leaders and my own presiding Bishop before visiting the home.

Later in the day I came home and found a message from somebody, speaking for Mrs Mandela, who indicated that she had waited for me and had left.

            "On Sunday the 15th of January, Mr Ayob went to see Mrs Mandela and was again unsuccessful in obtaining the release of the youths.  We were very, very frustrated by this time, and we were willing to try any method we could - any avenue, so that afternoon the Reverend Sizwe Mbabane and Mr John Reece and myself went to see Doctor Nthatho Motlana, who had just come back from Lusaka and had discussed this matter with ANC leadership there.\n Doctor Motlana first of all said he was extremely glad I had not gone to the home the day before.  He confirmed to me that when he had first visited Mrs Mandela, she had not given access to the youths, and he agreed that he would have one more attempt and try later in that day.  Then a little later in the day I received a message from Mr John Reece, which had come via Mrs Albertina Sisulu who he had seen the previous evening, and the message was to the Reverend Paul Verryn that he must stay out of Soweto because his life was definitely in danger.\n Doctor Motlana visited - according to him - his report to me, he visited Mrs Mandela at around 5 p.m. on that Sunday the 15th and spoke - he said - extremely strongly to her.  I had to make a decision, and I would want this Commission to understand that one of the many dilemmas related to Mr Verryn's safety: on the one hand, he had been subjected to vicious allegations about his character, and I did not wish to take any steps which would give the slightest hint to the public, to the media, or to anybody else that I had any doubt about his integrity.  \n And so I didn't want to withdraw him from Soweto, I didn't want to take him out of that house, I wanted to leave him where he was so he could get on with his job, and it would be clear that his church had confidence in him.  And at this point - having received a warning now from Mrs Sisulu, whom we respected very, very deeply - I had no option, and I ordered him out. And we took him out of Soweto and placed him on a sort of leave for the time being.  Then a little later in that day I was again asked to prepare accommodation for the youths because they were coming out. That was a phone call from Fink Haysom.  Then in the evening Xoliswa, Jerry Richardson, and three youths were in fact brought to Ismail Ayob. Ayob was told that before they could be handed over, there were certain matters to discuss and conditions.  \n He replied that his instructions were that they must be released unconditionally, and there was a fierce disagreement apparently, and they left with the children still in their custody.  On Monday the 16th of January, sometime in the morning, they were handed to Doctor Motlana and they wanted to go to the mission house, but he refused.  \n He then - through Mr John Reece at 3.30 in the afternoon, I got a call that Doctor Motlana was taking the youths to the offices of Krish Naidoo in Johannesburg. He said:quote: \"There are four of them and one seems high on drugs\" unquote.   I then spent a little while getting hold of two community leaders because I wanted credible community leaders to be present when these youths were handed over.\n And Stuart Ngwenya and Maths Ramagope arrived. Then I went to Krish Naidoo's office and I found four people.  There was Gabriel Mekgwe (Pelo), there was Thabiso Mono, there was Katiza  Cebekhulu, and then there was an older man of about, in my judgement, 30 who gave me his name as Manwa Maseko.  He was later identified by the youths, once they were out of earshot of him, as Jerry Richardson, so I realised that he must be some form of escort and not one of the youths themselves.\n There was a long discussion in the office. Mr Krish Naidoo indicated that these kids just want to lay allegations about Paul Verryn. And I replied that I would certainly listen to any allegations very, very carefully, but that I would also be having questions I would want to ask them about the circumstances of how they left the mission house, and who did it and why.\n Then Mr Naidoo indicated they wanted to get clothes at the mission house, and I indicated that that could happen. Somebody could fetch the clothes for them.  I then in the meantime had heard that this promised community meeting at last was taking place that night at a secret venue, and it seemed to me fortuitous that these events had coincided.  And I indicated to the youths that this meeting was about to take place that evening, and that it was to address the whole issue of how they had left the mission house and why, and whether there were true allegations against Reverend Verryn, and all the other things surrounding this crisis, and, therefore, would they be willing to come to that meeting?\n Two of them that is, Pelo and Thabiso agreed, they said they'd be happy to go to the meeting but Katiza  - who I think is the one that earlier Dr Motlana had suggested might be high on drugs, was extremely upset throughout the time that we were in that room together.  He couldn't sit still, he was very emotional, he was talking to himself quite a lot, and he refused the invitation to go to the meeting, and said he would not return to Soweto because he was afraid.\n Krish Naidoo then offered to look after Katiza  and said: \"Can I take you into my care\", and he agreed to that.  So at about 5.15 after a fairly tense hour or so in that office, I left with Gabriel (Pelo) and Thabiso, and we walked a block or so up to the Central Methodist Mission where the two civic leaders were waiting.  The man who later I discovered was Jerry Richardson followed us and then peeled off and went his way.  And it was clear that, when he had finally left the scene, there was a little bit more relaxation on the part of these two.\n In the meantime I had instructed Reverend Paul Verryn that he was not to communicate in any way with the released youths until after the community meeting had had a chance to question them.  So we got them some food, and then I drove them - and it was one of those things that happened in those days, you went to one place and they told you another place and you went to another place and they told you another place, and we finally ended up at the Catholic Hall in Dobsonville.\n In the car the two of them volunteered the following information: they never wanted to go back to the Mandela house, that they were badly beaten and the phrase that sticks with me is the phrase: \"Our eyes could not see for a week\".  They were worried about Stompie, and they had been told to accuse Paul Verryn or be killed.  They were also assaulted by Mrs Mandela herself and their companion earlier they revealed to me was Jerry, who they said is the worst of them all.\n Then we got to the meeting, which finally started at about 7.30 in Dobsonville. There were some significant church persons there, Father Lafont, a Catholic priest, Reverend Mbande of the Church of the Province, Reverend Bangula, a Methodist Minister, Mr Verryn was present, as was I.  There were about 150 people there representing every civic movement and trade union around at the time.\n And there were also some people who had been invited to come from Temahole, where Stompie originated from, and from Ikageng, where I think Thabiso and Pelo came from - their civics were represented - and the Crisis Committee was there.  There were also present at that meeting, 9 or 10 young people who had lived in the mission house at Orlando West and had not been abducted.\n The meeting was opened in prayer, and Mr Bangula then spoke on behalf of the Methodist Church and its concern, and how the church was concerned and involved in this situation.  I want to say if I may - just to put a little context to this - I was profoundly impressed by the atmosphere in this meeting. I didn't know what to expect and some community meetings can be very emotional.  There was a sombreness about this meeting, there was a gravitas about it, and one had the sense that the people present knew they were dealing with a profoundly hurtful, painful situation, and they conducted themselves - seeing that it was a kind of enquiry not unlike this one - they conducted themselves, I think, with immense dignity and concern to discover the truth.\n First of all, the residents of the mission house had a statement which they had all signed, and somebody by the name of Celo read that statement and gave an indication of how the abduction had taken place, who had come, who had been abducted - he himself had been apparently taken and then put back on the grounds that he was quote: \"politically reliable\" unquote. He felt that he'd had a narrow escape.\n And then Pelo and Thabiso were asked to tell their stories, and in summary what they said was, they had been abducted against their will, they'd been taken to Mrs Mandela's house, they had been beaten first by her, then by other members of the football team.  While they were giving evidence, Krish Naidoo arrived with Katiza,  accompanied by a member of the football team, and I have never seen such terror on people's faces.  If the football team knew where this meeting was taking place, should the meeting continue at all or were we all in fact in danger because they were heavily armed?\n And there was a debate for a while about whether the meeting could take place or continue but it was finally decided to continue but Mr Naidoo was ...
