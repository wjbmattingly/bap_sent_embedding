I was appointed deputy director of Interpol South Africa.  Commissioner John Wright was appointed as director.\n In 1994 I was appointed deputy district commissioner for Johannesburg North.  In 1996 I was appointed as area head of negative discipline.  This post comprises the control of discipline in the police force.  In 1997 I was appointed in my present post.\nI accept that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\nrequires my testimony regarding the period 1989 up until 1990 when \nI acted as head of covert strategic communications known as \nStratcom.  Now to understand the concept of strategic \nCommunication it is necessary to present the commission with a \ngeneral definition of strategic communications.  \nStrategic communications is the planned coordinated execution of a \ndeed and/or the presentation of a message by means of various\n communication instruments to -\n1.  change the attitudes, values and views of individuals\n and/or a group of persons and/or to create the required\n attitude and/or to maintain an existing attitude;\n2. to neutralise hostile propaganda and/or to utilise hostile\n          propaganda; and\n3. to reach national objectives.\n Stratcom can be seen as political warfare as utilised in the Republic of China or psychological warfare as utilised in Europe or civic action as utilised by the Americans or active measures as utilised by the old Soviet Union.\n Stratcom was a covert operation and was conducted in secret.  Stratcom was part of the national management system which came into operation on the 1st of August 1985.  The branch, strategic communication which coordinated all projects on a national basis functioned directly under the State Security Council.  Authorisation for a project was obtained by presenting a project per memorandum to the Minister of Law and Order and when authorised the project was registered with the branch for strategic communication, which as I said formed part of the State security council structure.  All registered projects were presented on an annual basis to the State President for evaluation and authorisation of secret funds.  \n Mr Gelberg, a national investigator with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission presented me with five documents and indicated that I will be required to testify about the contents and my knowledge thereof.  When I studied these documents it became clear to me that the documents related to Operation Romulus and Operation Ram.  \n As to amplify the above operations it is necessary to explain the operational structure of Stratcom, the Department of Law and Order through the security branch of the South African Police acted in the following three areas, the educational field, the labour field and the counter-revolutionary field.\n Operation Romulus was approved nationally under the counter-revolutionary field incorporating Operation Ram.  The operation was directed against all individuals and groups within South Africa advocating violence or were considered as revolutionaries and persons against peaceful change.  The objectives of Operational Romulus were the following:\n1 To question the credibility of the ANC;\n 2. the promotion of disunity between the ANC and the SACP;\n 3 the promotion of moderation and South Africa's interests in general.\nThese were the broad objectives of Operation Romulus and Operation Ram.\n I will now testify to my knowledge of the documents presented to me and my interpretation will be in general because these actions took place after I had been transferred from Stratcom.\n If we then look at Annexure A, I would refer the honourable Truth and Reconciliation Commission to the document with the heading \"Operation Romulus.  Dissemination of suitable material, re Winnie Mandela abroad - discrediting of the ANC\".\n This document was signed by the section head on the 20th of June 1991 and I can only interpret the relevance of the contents of this annexure in the light of the objectives of Stratcom.  I was not the author of the document.\n The objective as amplified in the annexure falls within the scope of the objectives of Stratcom.  The subject, Winnie Mandela, was considered as a revolutionary.  I say the name now, it is Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, but in the document they still talk of Winnie Mandela.  One of the methods utilised by Stratcom was to disseminate information obtained through intelligence to the media which was in fact the case in this instance.  I have no knowledge of the details that were disseminated in this instance, in other words I haven't had access to the actual news reports that I can say what the contents were of the articles.\n If we then look at Annexure B, the heading is \"Top secret Romulus incorporating Operation Ram\".  This appears like a report-back document from an operator.  The document is undated and I was not the author of the annexure and I have no personal knowledge of the contents thereof.  The document clearly states that the objectives of Operation Romulus and Operation Ram are almost identical.\n The method applied in this document was to prepare certain information gained through intelligence and then to present it to the local and international media.  The issues addressed were in line with the objectives of Operation Romulus.\n If we then look at Annexure C, sorry for the spelling mistake, it's \"Intended media release regarding the ANC's undemocratic policy, ethnic division in the organisation and the existence of and the conditions in the Mbarare detention camp in Uganda\".\n The annexure dated the 8th of November 1990 pertains to arrangements for the return of two exiles.  They were brought back under the auspices of an organisation called \"Returned exile coordinating committee\", also known as RECOC.  I was personally involved in establishing this organisation.\n The purpose was to have a media conference to discredit the ANC for their undemocratic policy and to disclose the circumstances in the ANC Uganda camp.  This action again fell within the objectives of Operation Romulus.\n Then if we look at Annexure D a telex, \"Project Romulus, covert ad hoc action to exert pressure on the ANC/SACP\".  This annexure is unique in that a national action was launched and conducted under Operation Romulus.  The instructions were that several aspects had to be addressed, for example an analysis of the latest election of the National Executive Committee and the influence of the SACP, that is the Communist Party, the National Executive Committee, the NEC.  I was effective in the placing of an article in the Citizen with the heading \"37 Reds elected to top ANC body\".  See copy of the article annexed to Annexure D marked Annexure D1.\n And then the last document is Annexure E, \"Commendation for exceptional work no.W87873B W/O P F Erasmus\".  This document dated the 20th of May 1991 had, after I had been transferred from Stratcom, I am not the author and I have no personal knowledge of the contents at all but this document is a recommendation for excellent service and outstanding performance of Paul Erasmus, who is sitting next to me, who was employed as a Stratcom operator in the Witwatersrand.  It was common practice to recommend policemen for outstanding performance and this is a typical example of a letter of recommendation.\n I am prepared to amplify the above here at this meeting.",

Now we had projects, these basic three major projects registered and it was Project Jackal, that was on the educational field, and then it was Project Omega, that was on the labour field, and then Project Wigwam which was on the counter-revolutionary field.\n Now you can look at it is like an umbrella project incorporating different operations then sub-operations.  Now Operation Romulus was one of those sub operations under Project Wigwam.  In other words in the counter-revolutionary field.  Now Operation Romulus was a national operation it was directed at the whole country, not to a specific or at a specific individual, and it is so that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was one of the what we can say major subjects within the Witwatersrand/Soweto area and therefore she did receive prominent attention through the Stratcom, but then there were hundreds of others over the rest of the country that also received similar attention through Operation Romulus.",

When I say aggressive, it's figuratively speaking and then changing the attitudes of all the people rather towards peace, so the theme changed to influencing people towards peace, towards negotiations and towards the new government.  So that what has happened is the people that were for the armed struggle, people that were for violence, they still were addressed through these operations and people that were for peace, they whenever a leader within the ANC spoke about peace, we would see to it that statement or whatever he feels, that that gets put out to the people.  So the whole situation changed and in I think it was February 1990  President F W de Klerk again asked for the different operations to be put before him and he was worried certain people were turning and were beginning to expose some of our fronts, so he was worried that it would come out and I had to give him the assurance that not any of my people would walk over to the other side, and I couldn't.

            "My name is Paul Francis Erasmus, I was a member of the South African Police from 1975 until 1993 when I was medically boarded for post traumatic stress.  I served as a field intelligence officer in the Security of the South African Police from 1977 until the 31st of May 1993 when my service was terminated.  From the time that I joined the Security Branch I was involved on various occasions in activities over a very wide sphere being conducted against the perceived enemies of the State.  These types of activities included harassment of suspects, the dissemination of information amongst the left wing community and many of these activities which could be described as dirty tricks.  In 1984 or thereabouts a formal Stratcom unit was created after a full cabinet and the State President had met together with senior politicians, department heads and members of the security forces.  A formal Stratcom Unit was then set up was then set up at Police Headquarters at Pretoria and over the following years I and members of the Security Branch participated in Stratcom activities, myself on an informal or ad hoc basis and during which time I also prepared graphic art work for the Stratcom unit.\n From 1985 to 1986 I participated in a major Stratcom type initiative after rumours in circulation at the time had indicated that Mrs Winnie Madikizela Mandela had a close association or friendship with Mr Chris Ball who was then MD of First National Bank or Barclays Bank as it was then known. I and other members of the Security Police or the Security Branch spread the story very widely that the friendship was in fact an affair and went to considerable lengths to put pressure on both Mrs Mandela and Mr Chris Ball and the bank, the idea being to create the perception amongst Mrs Mandela's power base, that is the radical black youth, that she had sold out to white capitalism and was having a sexual relationship with a man who epitomised white capitalism.  \n This type of operation was many in which we used accurate intelligence as well as fabrication in order to discredit the target person.\n Later in 1989 and 1990 it was decided that formal Stratcom units with full-time Stratcom representatives be created at all security branches all over South Africa prior to the creation of a formal or full time unit Stratcom units were coordinated in Johannesburg by a few individuals who were given this task but the gist of Stratcom activities were in the Johannesburg area were conducted from Pretoria.   In October 1990 I attended a formal Stratcom training course held at Esselen Park Johannesburg, that should actually read the East Rand.  During this course we were introduced to the various operations and/or projects including Project Wigwam which was the biggest project and which encompassed in full the national objectives of Stratcom, the counteracting a neutralising of the threat from ANC/SACP/COSATU alliance, the PAC and the extreme right wing.  Most of the actions carried out were, I just wish to point out that should be conducted and not concluded, were conducted under it's one and only project Romulus which can be defined as any ad hoc actions to further the aims of Wigwam, ad hoc referring to not only impromptu actions but to covert actions of an illegal nature on occasion.  \n I was on completion of the course appointed to head Wigwam, Romulus in the Johannesburg area.  We were inter alia informed on the course that Stratcom's aims were to reduce the ANC to just another political party within four years.  Radical elements within the ANC had been identified as targets.  The National Party believed that it could negotiate successfully with the moderates and radicals like Mr Chris Hani, Mrs Winnie Madikizela Mandela, Mr Steve Tshwete, Mr Peter Mokaba, Mr Tony Yengeni, Mr Joe Slovo and others had to be neutralised at all costs and obviously by any means possible.\n In the ensuing months after the course I was involved in many, especially Romulus type activities against not only the Tri-partite Alliance but the radicals I've mentioned above.  Using the existing intelligence Stratcom network, I turned a massive information or negative propaganda on a wide variety of matters.  As a basis for this disinformation I relied on intelligence reports including surveillance reports, telephone tappings, postal deceptions, hearsay and rumours and the media.  President Mandela was the obvious target, but due to his impeccable integrity it was difficult to target him in a  Stratcom sense and personally. We however put out the message that he had little control over the radical ANC cadres and SDU's.  There was a power struggle within the ANC hierarchy, he was going senile and had little control over his wife who was running rampant in the townships with a Football Club who inter alia were intimidating the local population. \n From time to time I received intelligence reports from colleagues in Soweto to the affect that the Mandelas were not sharing a bedroom and argued continuously. When a report for example stated that Mrs Winnie Madikizela Mandela had guests around for drinks I turned out information that she was an alcoholic.  When I heard rumours and received information about her association with activist lawyer Dal Mpofu, I put out the word that she was a nymphomaniac and for good measure her daughter Zinzi was also a nymphomaniac and also had a relationship with Mr Dali Mpofu.  \n Some of this information emanated from agents' informers within the Mandela circle and specifically the Football Club and occasionally it was possible to deduce with some accuracy who the informer was.  One of the reports I recall reading for example concerned Mrs Mandela, her daughter Zinzi and Jerry Richardson going to some or other meeting.  I deduced that Richardson had supplied the information although it is of course possible that he may have related it to another person who was an informer, though I also heard that Richardson's handler was Sergeant Pretorious of Soweto Security Branch.  I also heard from Colleagues in the Soweto Security Branch that most of the Mandela Football Club were informers were glue sniffing marijuana, that is dagga-smoking youngsters and who were easy to recruit as informers.  In some of the negative propaganda that I put out I introduced further fabrications to the effect that Mrs Mandela and Zinzi were also using marijuana, that is dagga and apart from factual evidence, like Mrs Mandela's earlier statement that the ANC would liberate the country with the necklace method, a statement which would be used with great effect in a Stratcom sense.\n On another occasion I spread the fabrication that the President had personally authorised the necklace method and which I believed was widely reported on international media.  Apart from spreading the information locally and nationally and especially via contacts in the intelligence community in the written and electronic media, I was able to recruit an agent in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, Britain  who immediately gave Stratcom Johannesburg an international capability.  Within days I was forwarding masses of Stratcom value material to him by fax, postal service and courier and telephone and not only by myself but via other agents and co-workers.  This agent had a massive conservative contact internationally including politicians, senior journalists, media representatives, intelligence contacts and so on.  Almost immediately dirt on the ANC and including matters relating to Mrs Mandela's activities and other relevant matters began to appear in the international press and of greater importance, in a Stratcom sense were forwarded ultimately to inter-alia the Conservative Party members and the British Prime Minister Mr John Major himself, whom so I heard was horrified with what he saw.\n A similar operation also came to effect as the doors opened in the United States and I was able to claim success with for example an article in Vanity Fair magazine entitled, \"How bad is Winnie\".  For these activities I received two commendations from the Security Branch hierarchy who were ecstatic with what was being achieved.\n I terminated my service from the Stratcom community in October 1991 when after I had been hospitalised for stress I applied for a transfer to the Security Branch Mossel Bay.  At the time of my departure the Stratcom unit in Johannesburg was headed by Colonel Bruwer with a Captain Erasmus as second in command. Our supreme commander in Johannesburg as it were responsible for Stratcom and intelligence was Brigadier Gouws and all our activities during the whole period I've discussed here fell under Section C.1 of the Security Branch head office.  Stratcom being headed for a time by Colonel Victor McPherson.  In command of C Section was Brigadier Alfred Oosthuizen and the section fell under the command of General P J Viljoen.\n Stratcom activities throughout were conducted on behalf of clients, that is the State President, the Cabinet, sister intelligence departments and the Department of Foreign Affairs and other State departments, for example the Department of Education.  All projects and activities were carried out with the full knowledge of and approval of the relevant ministers who received details thereon from the Stratcom component of the State Security Council.  There was a regular flow of intelligence and on occasion Stratcom value material between different Security branches.  I received information for example on the Mandelas from Security Branch Soweto especially as I developed the international capability and was the best placed person to utilise this information.  I was however only given information on a regular basis although I did recall that I requested but never received detail of for example the death of Stompie Seipei.\n Much of the information that I received was further not of possible Stratcom value and concerned the normal day to day activities of the target group.  My work load was too much for me to bear alone and much of the incoming information was handled by other Stratcom and Intelligence Unit operatives.  I do not know specific actions carried out by the Soweto Stratcom unit which was headed by Colonel de Jager.  My  contact person in Soweto Stratcom Unit was a Sergeant Badenhorst, although I did have a lot of contact with Col de Jager at seminars and meetings.\n Stratcom operations were carried out with all the security branches in South Africa at the time.  In the Soweto Security Branch personnel deal with Stratcom operations worked in tandem with Intelligence Unit.  I'm not sure in which manner Stratcom operations were related to Mrs Winnie Madikizela Mandela or the Football Club were carried out by the Soweto Security Branch but I am reasonably certain that they involved Stratcom intelligence personnel.\nI thank you.",

The telephone was tapped, the house was bugged, here movements were monitored on a 24 hour basis and I cannot think of any other circumstance or situation in the South African Police Security Branch where more attention was given to anything than Mrs Winnie Madikizela Mandela's situation.  Now with the advent of Stratcom in Johannesburg to get to your question, I began to receive intelligence reports and especially after this international capability that we had, had opened his doors to us, I began to receive reports but not on a regular basis.  There was some bureaucratic bungling or whatever but I received reports on an almost daily basis sometimes about the goings on within the Mandela home.  These reports were incredibly accurate.  What time the President got up, for example, literally what he had for breakfast, what Mrs Mandela was doing.  A lot of it was absolutely innocuous which wasn't of value to me in a Stratcom sense although I was exhorted on a day to day basis and given these reports and said do something with it as if I was a machine that could turn out a dirty trick for every occasion, I wasn't able to do it.\n I also received verbal reports about, I had never specialised and had little knowledge  of the Mandela United Football Club.

That would be the one type of scenario.\n We also made wide use of a tactic which was known as false-flag type of operations where you would pretend to be somebody else and then approach somebody and that person would be the unsuspecting victim of giving information to a person that wasn't what they believed that person to be.\n And then on the informer network itself I cannot comment on a sum of R10 000, it sounds a lot of money to my experience.  Our top agents during the time that I was involved in Stratcom received expense monies and the highest salary that I am aware of is the one offered to the principal agent in Britain at the time when we brought him to South Africa and that R6 000 a month apart from his expenses.

When Mr Semenya asked you whether the alleged rumour of a romantic link between the Archbishop and Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was a typical Stratcom operation you said yes, that was it.  Now in your own admission you confess to the knowledge of a rumour that links you romantically with Mrs Madikizela-Mandela and you say that is also a typical Stratcom operation.  Now the question I want to know from you is would there be any reason why there should be that sort of Stratcom operation?  Why would those who you left be keen to perpetuate disinformation about you because you say that is total rubbish, absolutely unfounded?",
