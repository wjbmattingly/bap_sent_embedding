Do you understand what our difficulty is?  You were asked a pointed question.  We presented a document to Mrs Mandela at the section 29 enquiry which we alleged was a document owned by the Crisis Committee.  Do you follow?  And what the question put to you was that her response to us was that you as the then Crisis Committee did not even own the document, you didn't even know about it.  And what she was wanting to establish was whether her response was correct\nin saying a document which we presented to her as your document was in fact not owned by you.  Now your response was confusing.  It certainly confused me.   Because you went on to say, you were talking about two different documents and in fact she must have been referring to a document emanating from the Dobsonville meeting.

            "We will come back to that document.  All right, I want to go on to where we were when we left off yesterday.  I am now looking at page 88 of the first section 29.  I want to read you an extract from page 88 onwards.  I am saying this in relationship to your - page 2 of your submission where you say the burning of the Mandela house and the origins of the Mandela Crisis Committee.  I understood you to say that after Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's house was burnt it created an intervention by prominent members of the community who later came to be known as the Mandela Crisis Committee to try and mediate the issue and also assist in rebuilding the house.  I want to put to you what Mrs Madikizela-Mandela said about this issue.  On page 88 I asked the question\n\"Were you aware of any tension between the Mandela United Football Club and other schools\n  in the area or football clubs\"?\nMrs Madikizela-Mandela:\n\"I know nothing about that, Mr Chairman.  I heard these things in the media\".\nI ask:\n\"What information can you give us about the attack on your Orlando West home by the Daliwonga students in February 1987?\"\nMrs Madikizela-Mandela:\n\"I was hoping someone would come and apply for amnesty and let me know and give me included that information\".\nI then asked:\n\"Do you have no knowledge of what caused them to attack and burn your house down?\"\nI am told:\n\"No, my house was bombed as much as I was bombed in Brandfort.  Three times.  It was nothing new to me because ....\"\nI try and interrupt - \n\"But in this particular - I beg your pardon\".\nAnd she goes on:\n\"Because I have been bombed throughout my political life of the time\".\nAnd I ask:\n\"But in this particular case, initially at least, a number of youths from the Daliwonga school were in fact charged\".\nI am told:\n\"I know nothing about that, I was not consulted, I was never told they had arrested some children\n who were charged.  You can go and check the court record\".\nI then ask:\n\"Was it not of the burning down of your house in Orlando West that what was referred to in the early stages as the Mandela Crisis Committee and subsequently as the Soweto Crisis Committee, was formed to mediate between the Mandela United Football Club and the scholars from Daliwonga?\"\nThe response is:\n\"No, I know nothing about that distortion of facts.  I don't know the Crisis Committee to have anything to do with the burning of the house in Orlando.  That is news to me\".\nI ask:\n\"When did you know about the Crisis Committee?  This is now Aubrey Mokoena, Rev Frank Chikane, Sister Bernard, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, Rev Beyers Naude, Mr Sidney Mufamadi?\"\nAnd there is mention of Mr Murphy Morobe as well.   No, no sorry and then I exclude Mr Murphy Morobe.  And Mrs Madikizela-Mandela asks me:\n\"Of the Crisis Committee?\"\nI said that is right.  Mrs Mandela answers:\n\"No, I think the people who formed the Crisis Committee, the way it was formed would be able to help us in that regard.  I was not part of the formation\".\nAnd then she goes on to say:\n\"Nor do I know the particular or the names, I am hearing of them for the first time.  I do know a\n  Crisis Committee was formed in Diepkloof\".\nI don't know if I need to go on.  But maybe further down that page where the chairperson Mr Ntsebeza asks:\n\"You yourself, when did you become aware of the existence of this group of people calling themselves the Soweto Crisis?\"\nAnd Mrs Madikizela-Mandela says:\n\"Well some community leaders just came home, I didn't even know they were in Crisis Committee.  I was not formally informed there was a Crisis Committee formed, nor was I informed where it was informed\".\nSorry, it is probably a typographical error.  Where it was formed.  \n\"... by whom it was formed.  A group of community leaders did visit me, although I wouldn't remember all of them\".\nAnd I ask:\n\"When was the first time you became aware of them, was it when they visited you?\"\nAnd she said:\n\"Yes\".\n \"When was that?\"\nShe says:\n\"Oh, I think it was somewhere in 1989\".\nAnd I said:\n\"In what connection did they come and see you?\"\nMrs Mandela answered:\n\"It was in connection with the youths who were in my house\".\nAnd I asked:\n\"What specifically regarding the youths?\"\nAnd she said:\n\"The youths were in the house, they were brought by Falati to my house\".\nFinally on this issue, I won't drag it out much longer.\n\"We will come back to that.  So regarding the burning down of your house in 1988 did the Crisis Committee have nothing to do with it in terms of trying to mediate to the best of your knowledge?\"\nAnd the answer I was given is:\n\"I think the Crisis Committee would be competent to answer this questions\".\nAnd I persisted, this is now four pages.  \n\"But did they come and talk to you about it?\"\nThe answer was:\n\"They did come to talk to me.  I wouldn't remember the details now, it is a long time ago, it was during all those difficult times anyway but there is a court record to that effect and I believe you would have access to it if you want to question us about the Crisis Committee all that is documented\".\nAnyway, it went on like that.  The question is it appears as if Mrs Madikizela-Mandela wasn't aware that you were there to mediate between the youth in her house and the Daliwonga students.  Did you make it clear to her what your proposed role was?",

            "I will answer the questions related to that matter and members of the now defunct committee will fill up on that.  If you look at our submission, submission\nparagraph 6 up to paragraph 19 all of that deals with the matter related to the burning of the house and I do say there that I arrived at the house and found their house burning, felt the consequences of that would be grave and then I convened an urgent meeting of selected group of respected leaders in paragraph 9 in the community who if you look at the background I referred to yesterday were strategically placed in different organisations at that particular moment so it wasn't a random type of selection.  And the main objectives of this group as I understood it at that moment, and I convened it, was to reach out to the community before midnight to stop any reaction by the community which would lead to further violent acts and possible loss of life.  The second objective was to consider ways in which the Mandela house could be restored to its original state and then we indicate down that submission to say that we did brief everybody we thought would help us to understand why the house actually got burned and in the course of that debriefing we identified people who could be useful on the ground, not the national leaders but people on the ground in the area and we visited a number of houses that night, up to two o'clock in the night.  But if you look at paragraph 3 subsequent to - 13, I am sorry, paragraph 13, subsequent to this a visit was also made to the Daliwonga High School as it was alleged that some of the children from the school were involved in the burning of the house.  That was the reason we were trying to reach out to everybody else and the committee members had occasion with the assistance of the principal, we talked to the principal, the teachers, the SRC to allow us to address the students and we addressed\nthe entire student body of Daliwonga High School.  The committee appealed for calm and was given an assurance that there would be no offensive action initiated from that school.  We wanted an assurance because we didn't want to see more violence in that situation.  If you continue with that text it then deals with the arrangements for security guards for the house.

I am sorry that I will take the Commission back a little bit just to make the point that after we were asked by Reverend Chikane to get together and we were briefed about the problem, indeed we did talk to a number of people who we thought could help us understand the origin of the problem.  That, as we say in the submission, includes members of the Mandela family.  I remember quite distinctly that we spoke to Mrs Mandela and we spoke to Zinzi Mandela.  We spoke to young boys who were said to be members of the Mandela United Football Club and it was during that consultation that we were told that the people who were suspected to have been responsible for burning the house were students from Daliwonga, which will then explain why we subsequent went to Daliwonga to speak to the students.  We felt it necessary even before going to Daliwonga High School to seek the commitment of in particular the boys who were introduced to us as members of the Mandela United Football Club, that there was going to be no attempt at retaliating.  Because if we were going to talk to the students at Daliwonga we should then be able to say we have the commitment of members of the Mandela United Football Club that there will be an end to the conflict.  When we spoke to the students, even before we spoke to the students at Daliwonga, as the Reverend Chikane is saying we visited a number of - I wouldn't even remember some of\nthe names - but young people in the area, especially those who were known to be Cosas activists.  As you were talking to them you would find that yes people were angry for a number of reasons.  One of them was the fact that the house which belonged to the Mandela family was burnt.  But also people were expressing anger about what they considered to be shall I say bullying actions by members of the Mandela United Football Club, which would therefore explain from their side why some students would have been involved possibly in the burning of the house.  So indeed we spoke to the students, we secured their commitment that there was not going to be any offensive action initiated from their side.  We reported this back to the Mandela family, it was necessary that we report that back.  Because there was no way in which we could have achieved what we went out to achieve, namely diffusing the conflict, the tension if we did not report back that the parties to the conflict are willing to end the conflict.",

Sorry, maybe I should just give a\nsmall context to it, which starts off on page 85.   I asked her regarding Mandela United Football Club:\n\"Did you provide food, clothing, education, all these amenities to the youth?\"\nAnd it goes on on page 86, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela:\n\"Yes I made sure that I got assistance for them\".\nMy question then was:\n\"In exchange did they have any duties?\"\nAnd the response was:\n\"No, not in exchange for anything.  What could I get from youth?\"\nAnd I asked:\n\"Were they ever used as a bodyguard for example?\"\nShe said no.  I asked:\n\"Were they ever used to guard the house?\"\nThe answer was:\n\"They were not used to guard the house for me but they monitored the house for themselves because three-quarters of them would be on the run for one thing or another from the police\".\nThat is the first response - that is the response from a section 29 enquiry.

The leadership of the Methodist church told us that the young people were kidnapped or abducted from the church, taken against their will to Mrs Mandela's residence.  Mrs Mandela maintained to us that they, namely the young people, came voluntarily because they wanted to run away from the situation where they were being sodomised.  Now these are two different versions.  We have no way of knowing in the first instance who was telling the truth.  If we knew that one of them was not telling the truth perhaps the route we would have taken was to informed (indistinct) been important for us to be advised as to what is meant by drastic action.  We spoke - we asked for access to the children.  From the information given to us by the leadership of the Methodist church we were talking about five children.  We were told that one of them is dead, which is where they claimed they got most of their information from about what happened to the children subsequent to them being taken to the house.  (Indistinct) particular person (indistinct) but when we went there we asked to see the children and when they were ultimately brought to us we noted that they brought only three.  But we couldn't just go there and say we thought there were five because we were trying to understand what is happening.  We were already told that according to Kenny Stompie was so injured after he was assaulted that he had been (indistinct) and Kenny feared the worst could have happened.   Now we are sitting there, Stompie (indistinct) there are three children, here for us their names who are you because we didn't know them.  And we know that none of them says I am Kenny which means the Methodist church could be right, Kenny has left.\nWe get worried, none of them says I am Stompie.  Then I wouldn't remember whether it was exactly in the first encounter but what the record (indistinct) is actually true that we were told that somebody, that Kenny had escaped.  I must say that we found it very strange, here are the children that come to Mrs Mandela's residence voluntarily because they believe that they are safer there, then one of them escapes.  Just one.  (Indistinct) when we personally (indistinct) Katiza started telling us a different version from what they told us (indistinct) and so on.  But it was at a time when we were questioning them one by one in the absence of (indistinct).  We didn't deem it prudent at that stage to confront Mrs Mandela with what Katiza told us because we knew at that stage in the absence of an agreement between us and Mrs Mandela that we were not going to take the children away with us.  If allegations of assault were true we could not guarantee Katiza's safety in that sense if we had said this is what he has told us.   We told the Commission in this submission that we are noticed what we thought were (indistinct) marks (indistinct) young people.  They said (indistinct).   If you look at the one report of Mr Tambo (indistinct) but we could not prove (indistinct).  But to some extent we were concerned about what we ourselves could do about the situation.

I would like to say, Chairperson, the impression should not be taken that responsible people like ourselves would actually have just (indistinct).  If you note at paragraph 31 of our submission we felt this is of vital importance there are two things which (indistinct).  When we got (indistinct) about that situation we took two actions basically.  One action was to communicate with Mr Mandela himself (indistinct) difficult (indistinct) and I negotiated with the lawyers to communicate this and just to ask Mr Mandela to persuade Mrs Mandela to do the following, hand over the young people alleged to be missing to be community leaders as a way of assuring the community that the youth are still alive because there was a suspicion they were dead, and to allow the Crisis Committee to assist with the dismantling of the club and to relocate its members away from Mrs Mandela.  And 3 make alternative security arrangements for her outside the club members.   And at the same time I was troubled and I took the opportunity to meet Mr Tambo himself and I even suggested, and this is the first time (indistinct) that I suggested a very drastic step.  We don't have a police force (indistinct).  We believe the police force (indistinct).   But at that time we did not have a police force (indistinct).  Both the police force and the army at the time were (indistinct) and there was no way (indistinct).

And that was a very, very drastic thing to say because if we tried we would have had to organise a (indistinct) so it wasn't as easy as that that we actually ignored the (indistinct).  It was a political crisis of the time that there was no credible police force we could resort to because the same policemen who managed that situation like in the Khotso House bombing I now learned that the policemen who came first to investigate about the bombing was the one who managed the operation.  And so you couldn't go to that police force and that (indistinct) to we felt the ultimate people in the liberation movement at that time was Mr Mandela himself and Mr Tambo.

When trying to recollect what happened, he had a diary that he could rely upon.  We were not relying on his diary because it was not collectively kept by us and him, therefore it might well be that as he was noting events, noting discussions with certain people, he used certain words which we feel may not reflect necessarily what we discussed with him.\n At no stage for instance, did he come to us and say: \"I have recorded here that you said you have no mandate, do you confirm this as a true reflection of our discussion or not\"?  I'm just giving you that as an example.  So, the point I'm making therefore is that to the best of his ability he reconstructed the events relying on his diary.

And I think the crisp question that I need to ask in connection therewith is the following - we know now - and it has nothing to do with ...[indistinct] but we now know on an objective assessment of all the evidence, that Katiza Cebekhulu was found in a Zambian jail.  \n And your own part was to arrange for him - on an analysis of what you considered his state of mind and health, for him to be placed in a Johannesburg hospital.

If any of you or you in particular, is able to tell us how he then landed in the Zambian jail away from the Johannesburg hospital where you had arranged for him to be placed at - that's the question.\n The second question to Minister Mufamadi and then I will shut up - I'm asking this question to you Mr Minister in your capacity now.  We know that Cebekhulu left or did not appear at his trial at which he was charged or was going to be a witness or I do not know right away, but he did not appear at his trial.  \n As a consequence thereof a warrant for his arrest was issued - a warrant which was still active as at the time that we began these proceedings and we had to get the intervention of the Minister of Justice for that warrant to be lifted for him to be able to be here.  Now, to the extent that one can rely on anything that he said, a person here who called himself Jabu Sithole, came here and told us that - though he didn't say so, like Cebekhulu he jumped bail whilst he was facing serious charges. \n On his word for political reasons he found himself abroad, he came back, he is gainfully employed in protection services at one of our airports.  The police know that he is here and from all indications, there has not been any warrant of arrest and therefore there hasn't been any need for any warrant for his arrest to be lifted in the manner in which Cebekhulu's case there has been that need.\n As a member of Government and as one who heads Safety and Security, I would like to hear your comments in regard thereto.",

In around 1958, I became the family doctor of the Mandela family and has been so till 1994.\n As the Mandela family doctor I have occasion to visit the Mandela residence on various occasions to provide medical assistance to the family and in the process became a family friend which I still am.\n Insofar as I can recollect, I remember receiving a telephone call form the Reverend Peter Storey regarding allegations that Mrs Madikizela Mandela allegedly made against Reverend Paul Verryn relating to the sexual assault of certain minors by Paul Verryn and was requested to intervene with Mrs Madikizela Mandela in this regard.\n I recall discussion the matter with Mrs Madikizela Mandela and emphasised to her the need to desist from making such allegations, if indeed she had made them.  Again during the early part of 1989 - I can't remember the date, I further recall a meeting with certain members of the clergy at my house at Diepkloof, amongst whom were Reverend Peter Story.\n At this meeting I recall that the matter of certain minors who were allegedly held against their will at the home of Mrs Madikizela Mandela, being discussed.  At this meeting I was requested by the said members of the clergy as a concerned member of the community and a friend of the Mandela family, to intervene and attempt to have the said minors released.\n I recall attending at Mrs Madikizela Mandela's residence and discussing the concerns that had been raised with me regarding the said minors and requested that they be released.  \n I had forgotten about all this Mr Chairman, but my wife recalls that a certain gentleman by the name of Richardson brought three minors early one morning during my absence - our house in Diepkloof.  My wife informs that she requested the said Richardson to take the children back to the Mandela residence from whence I would then fetch them later of when I got back from the city - Johannesburg.\nI've now been reminded that I personally drove the said minors to the offices of Krish Naidoo at the Carlton Centre\"\nThat Mr Chairman, concludes my statement.",

            "Briefly.  As I've said, it is important to locate the proper context in terms of the sequence of events as they are reflected in Bishop Storey's submission.  On page 9, paragraph 5, it is alleged that our visit took place on Friday the 18th of January 1989, I think that is a mistake.  Firstly, the 19th of January was not on a Friday but was on a Wednesday.\n Bishop Storey's submission itself talks about events happening on a Tuesday the 17th in the previous paragraph and there's a gap between the two, so that's the first thing.  I think this clarification is important in order for the Commission to understand our purpose in visiting Mrs Mandela.  Our visit happened on the 13th, on a Friday the 13th and not the 18th and therefore I would like to go to my statement with that background.\n\"I'm an ordained Minister of the Methodist Church, Southern Africa.  In 1987 I was appointed by the conference of my church to Jabavu in Soweto as a Superintendent Minister.  From the 7th of December 1988 to the 5th of January 1989, I was away on holiday.   On my return I received a report from the second steward Mr James Sebe, that young men who were living at our Orlando Mission House were removed from there by Xoliswa Falati and some members of the Mandela Football Team.\n It was further reported to me that the stewards did not know what to do as Reverend Verryn was on holiday.  I immediately reported the matter to Bishop Storey, then our district Bishop and he suggested that it would be good if I could attend a meeting by community leaders which was scheduled meet - correction, in the following week to deliberate on the matter.\n I went into that meeting with the following concerns:\nWhy were the young men removed from the mission house?\nWhy or where were they by then?\nWhat was the basis of the allegations leveled against Reverend Paul Verryn?\nWhat could one do in respect of Mrs Mandela who was and is a member of my church?  This was a pastoral concern.\nFortunately in that meeting which happened on the 12th of January now, I could not get an answer to my concern.  It became clear that maybe a meeting with Mrs Mandela - as she seemed to be a key person who could through some light on the whole matter, was needed - correction, so that I could provide clarification to the congregants in my ...[indistinct] as there was a deep concern about what was happening around the church at that time.\n As the matter was of a national concern by then, it seemed wise to request other church leaders to join me in the consultation with Mrs Mandela.  I then requested Bishop Manas Buthelezi and Father Mangaliso Mkhatsa to accompany me to Mrs Mandela's place.\n I phoned Mrs Mandela and made an appointment to see her with other members of the clergy, she agreed.  In our discussion with her she informed us:\nThat she was informed that the children - that's what she said at the time, the children were being sexually abused by the Minister at the mission house.  She had sent some people to collect the young men so as to ensure their protection from what she perceived then abuse.\nWe asked her about the whereabouts of the young men, she told us that they were safe and sound and she promised that they will be returned to Central Methodist Church in Johannesburg for safekeeping at Bishop Storey.

In that capacity I interacted with organisations of young people, students, workers, cadres, religious leaders and a broad spectrum of political leadership in and around Pretoria and beyond it's borders.\n Most of my activities took place in Soshanguve, a Black township North West of Pretoria.  During January 1989, Reverend Mbangula of the Methodist Church communicated with me expressing his concern  that certain children had been removed from the mission house belonging to the Methodist Church at Orlando in Soweto.\n Reverend Mbangula requested me to accompany him and Bishop Manas Buthelezi to visit Mrs Mandela.  On Wednesday, 13th January 1989, we met Mrs Mandela at her home and enquired about the alleged removal of the children from the Methodist Mission Home.  Mrs Mandela informed me, Reverend Mbangula and Bishop Buthelezi that she had been advised that children were being abused at the mission home and that she had decided to take them into her home as protection.\n The visit ended with a prayer in which Mrs Mandela and her daughter Zinzi participated.  At the time of the visit none of the children were at Mrs Mandela's home.  I've no other knowledge at all of the matters referred in the Subpoena which had been served on me to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the period 24th November to 28th November 1997\"\nI thank you Chairperson.",
