But one of the issues to be enquired into and if I may just identify it for the record it is item No. T. The abduction and imprisonment of Katiza Cebukhulu in 1991. This relates to his experience in Lusaka. The import of Baroness Nicholson's evidence will be to the effect that she is a member of Parliament and she is involved in refugee work and charity work around the world and she happens to come across this young man who is languishing in prison and I intend to lead her on that type of evidence.\n I have a suggestion, bearing in mind that they are to fly out of the country this evening. In the ordinary course what should happen is Mr Cebukhulu should be subject to cross-examination by the various representatives. I am wandering whether it wouldn't speed up things, because I don't anticipate her evidence is going to be controversial from the point of view that it implicates on first hand knowledge any personality over here. It might well be to hear her evidence in regard to what she can tell you and your Commissioners about Zambia and when each person then cross-examines you will then have an indication that the cross-examination will only related to the evidence of Mr Cebukhulu.

I went out of my way in leading this witness to lead him on the real issues which I think this Commission is interested in, the issues being the issues that you've identified in the subpoenas.\n Insofar as collateral matters are concerned, even if this were a court of law, when a cross-examiner asks a question on a collateral matter he's entitled to do that, he is then bound by the answer.  So I'd ask you to bear that in mind and ask my learned friend to restrict the questions to the issues.  \n I remind my learned friend that in the time that I have been here listening to him cross-examine there have been many occasions where he has refrained from putting his client's version to any witness, whether it's an admission or a denial.

            "Yes, I can clarify this and thank you for asking me.  I think it's best if I speak with no notes and merely tell you what happened, but I preface my comments by saying that the explanation came from Kenneth Kaunda himself that I have a record of that interview, not word for word, but I have the questions I put to him, the answers he gave me, and I stayed on a further hour after the interview was complete.  And therefore I understood the full picture.\n Please recollect that I saw President Chiluba on the first day that he became President of Zambia for the first time.  In fact I was his first visitor.  I was there at 9 o'clock  in the morning and I received the name of Katiza Cebekhulu at about five to nine as I was leaving my hotel, and I want to point out here, that I had no knowledge of him, no knowledge of the case, I knew nothing about any of this at all.  I merely, with some difficulty, because it was a complicated name for somebody from my language, I with great difficulty wrote down the name and put the name to President Chiluba.\n When President Chiluba had authorised a search and the search had proved successful, which was some hours later, President Chiluba told me that the record, the government record which he then had looked up, because he hadn't expected to find a South African national in a Zambian jail, those were his very words to me, that the records appeared to show, that the order to take Katiza Cebekhulu out of South Africa and into Zambia purported to have come from President Mandela who was not of course then president.\n I took that comment for what it was worth and made the assumption that either somebody was using the leader's name which in politics is not just a daily but an hourly and a minutely occurrence, everybody always says they're doing things in the name of their political leader, frequently it isn't so, or if the order had come from Mr Mandela, I reached the immediate conclusion, that it had been an excellent thing to do because if that was so, whoever had given the order, as far as one can tell from the story, that saved his life, because this young man was saying if had he stayed in South Africa, he would have been dead.  Therefore I gave that point no rating at all.  In fact it was of such unimportance to me that I did not mention it, that the journalist who wrote the book until I think it was early June or late May 1997, because it had not seemed to me to be of any value at all.  If it wasn't President Mandela somebody had done this young man a good deed.  If it was President Mandela, well he had done the good deed, and so much the better.  It was of no value to me.  What mattered to me was finding him somewhere to stay.  And I think that if you enquire from the journalist you will discover that I told him, I just let it slip in, I think the middle of May, or late May, early June in 1997, it was something of so little consequence to me. \n However, both the journalist and the film producer, I am sure they will confirm this, they are both men of high integrity, thought this was very important, and therefore requested me to ask President Chiluba again and requested me to ask former President Kenneth Kaunda.  I should explain that in order to make the film we spent three days at the end of May in Sierra Leone, just as Sierra Leone was blowing up and went on to Zambia in a separate trip, several weeks later to clear up the ends and the bits and pieces of the young man's stay in Zambia.\n However, it was not proper for me to ask President Chiluba. Our 1991 discussion was history and what we discussed there is on the record, is available and can be talked over, I am sure, with him as well.  I did have a meeting with President Chiluba and it was a private, off the record confidential discussion with nobody present, certainly no journalist and no staff and ...(intervention)",

            "Yes.  And this in fact was not the topic of our discussion because the person to ask, which was the question I put to President Chiluba was that I was there with the film crew, would he mind if I went around a little bit and did some filming and also talked to Kenneth Kaunda.\n As a result of that I went off to see Kenneth Kaunda and took a list of questions to try to get to the bottom of the puzzle as to why he was in Zambia in the first place.  And I had a very, very long, two to three hour meeting with Kenneth Kaunda of which about a half hour I think, it may have been more, is recorded on video and a clip from that was used in the film.  And the video transcript is the intellectual property of the BBC and I can give you the details who to write to if you wish to have it.  I will, however, give you my very, very full note on the meeting.  And the key to the answer was that Kenneth Kaunda had not had a message from Nelson Mandela at all.  He had been asked to take Katiza Cebekhulu in by Oliver Tambo.  He explained to me that this was in a sequence of a long period of time during which he had taken in both freedom fighters and young men and I suppose women, who had offended the movement and were at risk in South Africa while their cases were being examined, and Katiza Cebekhulu fell into the latter category.  He said most of those young men were not in prison.  At any one time he had 60 or 70 of them, but he also at any one time have 15 or 20 in prison who had been so difficult and were such trouble, that they were better off protected inside the jail.  And there were also, he told me, many thousands of freedom fighters during that time whose training he organised with Moscow. \n To go back, however, to the point at issue, which is the taking in of people in trouble, I said why were they in trouble?  He said, well you have to understand that towards the end of this period of freedom fighting in South Africa the movement became very suspicious of many, many people and often people were fingered on suspicion which was not valid.  Therefore the best thing to do was to take them out of the way while the case was examined, while the heat settled and then they could go back again.  I said, and was Katiza Cebekhulu one of those?  He said yes, he was one of those.  He hadn't offended the whole movement, but there was a small wing of the movement, there was a group of people who wished to have him killed.

Now certainly through the cross-examination that has taken place here today there are issues of Katiza's credibility at stake and the difficulty we sit with is you have now added a further rider to the issue by saying that there was no time for the author to actually check the book itself with the person who is purporting to tell his story.  Now that immediately raises certain questions.  One, that a number of people are vulnerable to really very serious allegations.  They relate to murder and torture and violence which the Commission, through its Act construes as gross human rights violations.  Now there was no cross-referencing  in terms of what you said that Katiza didn't proof-read the book, but the book was published, it was launched quite spectacularly with the book launch and in London, in South Africa was shown on our TV screens at the same time and people's reputations are at stake.  Now the Commission is faced with a huge problem because in an afternoon session like this we can't really explore all of the contradictions and that the contradictions are left with us I think all of us are really sitting with a major problem.  And I have to ask, why was it necessary to launch this book then with such great haste, because we're really dealing with a really serious aspect of  our history and at the end of it I'm not sure how we're going to make a finding on what has been told us today.",

            "I haven't given you all I'm afraid, that in Denmark there was this very extraordinary response, in Sweden the same, USA, Canada, all of these countries.  Now I myself was in no position to have the time or the knowledge to test any of the points that Mr  Cebekhulu had made.  As a matter of fact please bear in mind that between 1991 when I had maybe an hour I suppose with him, with the Zambians, and 1995 when I had several weeks with him, I never saw him and I had merely a small handful of letters.  I therefore had no knowledge of his case, of any real validity at all.  That was of no consequence because all I was trying to do was find him somewhere to live.  It was not my job to talk about South African matters.  I did see it as my job as somebody who works a great deal with refugees having the extraordinary coincident of finding him to try to find him somewhere to go.\n Now by 1993 when we were in this extraordinary pickle with the UNHCR saying it was unique, they had no accredited refugee for whom they couldn't find a place.  They could think of no think of no case like him.  It would be difficult to think that everything he had told at UNHCR, he had given them his story in great detail, and the Zambian newspapers was utterly without any foundation at all because these countries had to have reasons.  They were all offering the same reasons related to his knowledge.\n In 1993 however, despite having been asked to keep this story very low key so as not to unsettle the unity of the ANC, which I did, I in fact published knowledge of the case and of his assertion that he'd seen Mrs Winnie Mandela stab Stompie in a book of my own which was published and which I'm happy to leave you a copy.  I also made reference to the case in a second book I wrote in 1996 which was a political book about why I left the right wing Conservative party and joined the left of centre Liberal Democrats, and I'm happy to leave you that as well.\n Now to go back to your point, by 1995 Katiza Cebekhulu had spent two years in Sierra Leone.  I had made the assumption that once the ANC or rather the non-apartheid government had taken power, that cases such as his that surely were a fall-out from the struggle, would be sorted out.  I was extremely disconcerted to discover no movement at all and a continued block on any country giving him settlement and a continued block on leading members of the ANC whom I knew personally refusing to even discuss his case at all.  Therefore I responded to his despair by saying yes I would \ndo what I could to get his story published.  He wished his own story to be published under his own name and he sent me a small book, it would have been very difficult to get that published in the United Kingdom, such detail and of little interest, however, journalists had been hounding me for access to Mr Cebekhulu in the utter mistaken belief that he had been living with me all the time in my home.  As I say correctly he had been in jail for three years, he was then at that stage into his third year in Sierra Leone and I therefore made a huge effort for him to try to solve this settlement to see if getting something on the record of what he said, and in trying to get that check would assist his case.  As a working member of Parliament I certainly had no opportunity to come to South Africa, sit her, study that evidence, I therefore could not write a book.  It was not my knowledge and I would not have dreamt of trying because I was a busy member of Parliament.  As I said earlier I was busy caring in the south of Iran and Iraq and Lebanon, Palestine, Rumania, now Rwanda and I think in Sierra Leone soon for about 15000 refugees to do voluntary work in addition to my parliamentary work.  I just didn't have time.  So I responded to one journalist who seemed to me to have the upper hand in his request, which was Fred Bridgeland - why did he have the upper hand because it was he who originally had asked me to see if Mr Cebekhulu was in prison.\n Now Mr Bridgeland is an author, he chose not to co-partner Mr Cebekhulu and that was understandable as after his very few weeks in the United Kingdom Mr Cebekhulu went straight back to Sierra Leone where he stayed until very, very recently indeed. So he spent all of this time away and therefore Mr Bridgeland wrote his book and spent considerable time in South Africa double-checking and brought a team here too.\n And I, myself, therefore believe that it is a book of great merit, but it is not an autobiography of Katiza Cebekhulu, it is not a book co-authored by Katiza Cebekhulu and it is not a book in which I have the capacity to check the facts.  My foreword relates to my finding Mr Cebekhulu and how I subsequently tried to get him a place and what reaction I have had.",
