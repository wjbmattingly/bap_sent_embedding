Now if she was as seems to be the impression created, if she was as vindictive, then how is it possible that you survived this period when people are saying that you're an informer and not only that but you mange to leave on an ANC ticket to go to Uganda in 1992?",

When I got Mhlongo I got that message that my mother called and there is this message.  When I got home she told me that and she also further said that if I die she will bury me.\n I went back to Mhlongo, I don't remember what I had gone there to do, but when I was approaching my house I was coming from the passage I met three boys, I did not know their names, I did not know even themselves but there is one that I knew, it was Killer.  Madonda and Katiza did not know them.  I just heard them grabbing and I saw them grabbing me, they said you are Spotch and let's go to Mama.  I asked as to which mother are you referring to because my mother is at home.  And Katiza - and I took a gun from Madondo and gave it to Boli. There was another boy called Boli.  I took the gun from Maxwell Madondo and I gave it to Boli.  I don't know where he went to and Katiza and Killer fled.  I was left with Madondo there.  \n We forward up until we got to my house. I wanted him to explain to my mother as to why and the reasons, and furnish my mother with the reasons why I would be killed and he did not want to do that.  He jumped the fence. No that's when we started fighting around the fence, right next to the fence and I grabbed him, and some other boys came and we started assaulting and I hurled a big stone to him and he died with that.  I did not intend to kill him.  I only wanted him to go and talk to my mother and explain my mother as to why they wanted to kill me.\n After I pelted the stone at him we removed his body and we put it on the other side of the street and I left the scene.  As I was approaching from the passage, coming from the Ikaneng's area I saw a red car, I don't remember if it was a Mercedes but it was red in colour.

            "During 1989 February - (the speaker's mike is not on) - during February 1989 we were at Dudu's house, myself, Matanda as well as Finky.  As we were still sitting there - (the speaker's mike is not on) - I heard the gate opening, I went outside to find out, I stood at the step and saw the gate was opened and I called on to the dog Sizwe, and Sizwe came from the street into the yard and I closed the gate and went back into the house.\n I spoke to Matanda as well as Finky and told them that they should go to sleep because it was quite late and they had to go to school the following morning.  They protested and said they were watching the TV.  After a few moments I could hear the gate opening once more and I went out.  I called onto the dog Sizwe and the gate was open at the time and I could detect some noise from the dustbin as if there is somebody who had got into the dustbin.  I went towards the postbox and I thought the dog had got into the dustbin to seek some food.  Then I walked quite a distance and when I turned around I saw a tall man whose face wasn't visible and I saw another one with a gun and he fired. I ran into the house and closed the door after me.  We ran into Dudu's bedroom and Finky, the one who passed away, ran into the wardrobe and I stood next to the window together with Matanda and I tried to phone Abigail.  I told her that I had been shot at and Abigail said I must just stay put she is still trying to struggle with Mbuso.  I phoned my cousin who stays in Orlando East, Harold Chili and told him to phone the Orlando Police because there were people shooting at us.  I also phoned my boyfriend from Meadowlands Zone 7 and said Mkhonzo please phone the police to come and assist us because we were being attacked.  And at that moment the phone was cut off I believe from outside and I saw a round object that hit me on the thighs and at that time I caught fire and I was on fire when I saw - after having thrown the petrol bomb they threw a 25 litre of petrol and it burst.  At that moment I saw Finky coming from the corner and fell right before my feet.  I tried to pull hr out into the passage to rescue her and at the time I was in flames.  I left Finky all by herself.  I went into the kitchen, I went to the sink, I tried to put the flames out using the water from the sink.  When I went back I could see the fire, the flames burning the carpet in the dining room and I asked Matanda as to whether she was injured.  She just screamed and said we should run outside and I said we can't go outside at this juncture.  It was dark now in the house.  I pulled Barbara out, we were already suffocating at that stage because there was a very strong smell of petrol.  I hit the window thinking that the window would break only to find that it doesn't break and I went back inside.  Now the house was very dark engulfed in flames as well as smoke.  After quite some time I said Matanda I had been burnt.  We were scared to go out because we didn't know where the attackers were and she told me that she heard Matanda's mother swearing, asking her as to why they were killing us and why were they attacking Dudu's house.  I told Matanda that the people were there and they opened the door at a later stage.   I went into the chicken shed.  I don't know where Matanda went.  I remained in the chicken shed at that time.\nI at a later stage jumped the fence into the opposite house where I related the story to Tsili that I had been burnt.  We had been attacked, my thighs were burnt. Tsili brought a bottle of fish oil, he took off my dress and poured fish oil over my wounds.  Tsili's mother came over and said Barbara I have come to fetch you, the police are here already, and I was scared to go.  I didn't know where the attackers were but I ultimately went out.  \n We got to my place and there were a lot of people there.  Finky had died already and they were trying to remove her body out of the house.  I told them that I had been burnt and I was in tremendous pain.  Abigail sent her boy Mtatu to fetch the car so that they could take me to the hospital.",

The position was that we had reached the last day of the trial and I had intended to call Katiza Cebekhulu but he was not available at court and I then said to the State prosecutor that this would necessitate a postponement because I considered this to be rather essential evidence insofar as the defence was concerned.  He then asked me what it was that the witness would say.  I told that - I mentioned to him that that was what the witness would say, he said that he was aware of that information and that the State would therefore make that admission, and the State therefore made that admission and it was no longer necessary to call Katiza Cebekhulu, and the matter went on to the records.  After that had occurred, as I recall, it's been some years of course, Katiza Cebekhulu arrived at court but it was not necessary to call him because the admission had already been made.",

Now we suddenly go to 1989 and the threats or you hear again that your son's life is at stake, now I want to actually try and separate, if I can, what happened in '86 from '89 because to me it doesn't seem to make sense.

            "Thank you.\n\"My name is Vusi Madida.  I was born in Mozambique and I am presently living in Johannesburg\".\nI go on to paragraph 11 -\n\"In November/December 1992, after there was a lot of publicity around weapon smuggling from Mozambique to South Africa I decided to go to the police and give the information I had about Alex Mamba and his involvement in weapon smuggling from Mozambique.  I went to the police station in West Street in Durban, I met with a policeman in civilian clothes.  After 15 minutes I was fetched by a police car, I was taken to C R Swart police station in Durban.  We had a discussion and he told me to write down my story and to come back after a couple of days.  He also told me he had been a Koevoet member.  Furthermore he gave me his telephone number.  I cannot remember the name of this police officer but I gave the name in a statement to representatives from the organisation, Lawyers for Human Rights in 1993.\n I went home and wrote down my story.  I contacted the police officer the next day.  I met him the same evening.  He took me to the beach front in Durban and I gave him the statement.  He was not satisfied and said he wanted more information about ANC members, ANC training, ANC offices etc.  He also showed me photographs of ANC members.  I identified some people from photos that he showed me.  He gave me R300 in cash and also asked me to go to KwaMashu township, J Section to see if I recognised any MK soldiers.  I was told to inform him if I identified any MK members.  \n I met a girl that I knew from my time in exile, she showed me around and I met a number of MK soldiers that I could point out for the police.  After I delivered some information I was asked to leave Durban and to go to Johannesburg.  They wanted me to work for the police in Johannesburg.  I was told to contact the police in Durban as soon as I arrived to get further instruction.\n When I came back to Johannesburg I went to the Madida's house where I had stayed before.  I contacted the police in Durban and I was asked to go to Shell House and try to identify some of the people there.  I phoned the police in Durban and told them that I had identified some people then they told me they wanted to meet at the Carlton Centre, this was in December 1992.  I was later introduced to two people, probably from Johannesburg CID.  I was told to contact them again.\n In mid-January 1993 I was told by the policeman from Johannesburg that I should go to KwaThema Social Welfare to get help.  Everything was arranged, I went there and they arranged a house for me to stay in.  Later I was contacted and taken to Springs police station.  At the Springs police station I met with police officer Mr Bowen.  He instructed me to cooperate with some other people that would contact me at a later stage. \n Furthermore he told me to tell these people that I had been involved in violent operations with other black people.  According to the instructions I should tell these people that we had been given instructions by Mrs Winnie Mandela and that she also on some of the occasions had participated in the operations.  The operations were about killings at train stations and in townships.  \n I was taken to certain places by the police and showed the scenes of previous incidents.  At these places I was given detailed instructions about which stories I should tell the people who would contact me at a later stage.  I was also told to implicate ANC members that I knew in these operations.  I was furthermore instructed to mention Alex Mamba as the weapon supplier and that we also, on a few occasions, got weapons from Mrs Winnie Mandela.  I remember that I was instructed to mention that I was involved in the Thokoza massacre, Mzimhlope train station massacre....\"\nit says \"Kalweni massacre\" here, I see it's (...indistinct)\n\".... all those incidents took place in 1991/1992.  I was given these instructions at the Springs Police station, I was given R400 the same day, this was in the beginning of February 1993.\n On the 12th of February 1993 I was called to the Social Welfare Department, I met with people who I later understood were from Lawyers for Human Rights, they told me they wanted to speak with me about my role as an informer, they took me to their offices, the office on Von Weilig Street in Johannesburg, there was also a man from ANC Intelligence Service who came to see me.  I was interviewed for a couple of months by different people from the LHR, they didn't believe me so I finally confessed that it was a set-up.  \n Later I was sent to the Goldstone Commission, I stayed for two months under the witness protection, however, I was interviewed by members of the Security Branch head office and I didn't trust them so I decided not to cooperate.\n I left the Goldstone Commission in July 1993.  Later when I applied for an extension of my passport I was arrested and taken to John Vorster police station.  I was interrogated and forced to give them information as to where to find weapons.  I showed them a place in Dube in Soweto where they found six AK-47's and one Makarov pistol.  This was in block 8B.  After this I was deported to Mozambique.  This was on 16th of October 1993.  \n I do not remember the names of all the people from the police that I met but I think I gave the names to the Goldstone Commission.  There should be documentation available from my testimony before the Goldstone Commission.\n Vusi Madida\".",

Firstly we will have a fairly heavy programme tomorrow.  We will try to start with the police who are, the one policeman who was ill and he is going to be here tomorrow, straight after that was early as possible in the day, Jerry Richardson and then obviously Mrs Madikizela-Mandela.  We are hoping very much indeed that we can finish tomorrow night, we will not rush it unduly.  If there is more time needed we will have to meet on the Thursday.\n The second announcement is an announcement which the Archbishop will now read which has to do with the announcement by the Minister of Justice concerning the recommendations of the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry concerning very serious allegations against Mr Dumisa Ntsebeza.

            "Thank you very much.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission warmly welcomes the findings and recommendations of the Goldstone Commission of Inquiry.  Whilst Judge Goldstone's finding that the allegations are false was wholly expected we are nevertheless thrilled that Mr Ntsebeza's name has been cleared completely and finally by an independent Commission of Inquiry.\n Having acknowledged when we called for the Commission to be appointed that we should have referred allegations implicating Commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza in the Heidelberg Tavern attack to outside investigators we accept without hesitation Judge Goldstone's finding that we erred in not having the allegations independently investigated immediately upon learning of them.\n The failure of the police to follow up and investigate properly the allegations against Mr Ntsebeza is shocking, as were the actions of senior police officers in casting aspersions on Mr Ntsebeza in newspaper interviews during the recent controversy over the allegations.\n We welcome the recommendations -\n1. that a further investigation should be held to establish both the motives of Mr Bennet Sibaya in implicating Mr Ntsebeza and whether other persons conspired with Mr Sibaya;\n 2. that this further investigation should be overseen by the Independent Complaints Directorate of the SAPS;\n 3. that the Attorney General should consider criminal proceedings against Mr Sibaya.\n The TRC intends pursuing vigorously action against Captain John Lubbe, a former TRC investigator for improperly removing documents from our possession.\n The Commission also welcomes Judge Goldstone's perceptive references to the role which racism and fear of perceived racism may have played in the handling of this affair.  We agree that it will require hard work from all sectors of society including within the TRC to overcome this problem.  \n Thank you.",
