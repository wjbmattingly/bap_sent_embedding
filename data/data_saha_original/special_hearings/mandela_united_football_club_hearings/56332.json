            "Mr Naidoo was, very, very strongly, asked to explain how it was that he dared to come here with a member of the football team.  Now, we later discovered, although he didn't acknowledge it then at all, that he had attempted to get Mrs Mandela to attend this meeting, but she had refused.  The evidence then continued and focused now on Stompie, who they said had been badly assaulted and taken away early on in their detention.  His whereabouts were unknown.  Then Katiza was brought in and he gave evidence, and he admitted that he had participated in the beatings that took place once the youths had arrived at the Mandela house, and when he was asked why, he said, well, they were being beaten and I also felt like beating them.   \n He alleged that Paul Verryn had lain on top of him on one occasion, and that was the only allegation during the night of any kind of misconduct by Mr Verryn.  He was also asked to describe Stompie's injuries, and he said he was soft on one side of the head, and had been beaten so that he could not see out of his eyes, and had been picked up and dropped on the floor, and that he couldn't walk.  Asked where Stompie went, he said he didn't know.  Quote,\n\"When I came back to the house, Stompie was missing.\"\nUnquote.  Asked whether he thought Stompie was dead he answered \"yes\".  \n Then Paul Verryn was asked to respond to the allegations of sexual, the allegation of sexual misconduct, and he denied the allegation.  Then members of the Crisis Committee indicated that the only other youth to make such allegations when they met them in Mrs Mandela's house was Thabiso.  He was then asked if he stood by that allegation against Mr Verryn, and he indicated that he withdrew it unconditionally, because he had been forced to say it.  I then indicated to the meeting that, if there was any credible evidence of homosexual activity by Mr Verryn, I would have to institute proceedings against him, and I invited Thabiso and Gabriel or Pelo, and the nine other residents of the Verryn house to offer any allegations of any conduct, any conduct unbecoming of a Minister.  \n No such allegations were made.  Instead a youth by the name of Thomas stood up, and he indicated that he had been in the house since 1987. He'd often shared a bed with Paul Verryn, but no hint of any misconduct had ever taken place.  He asked the other nine whether they supported him in this statement, and they agreed.  I then asked the meeting at large whether any of them had any such evidence, and their answer was in the negative.  There followed a unanimous vote of confidence in Mr Verryn and a commitment to ensure that he return safely to his work.  The Chairperson of the meeting, Mr Ngwenya, indicated anger that the integrity of one of our Ministers should have been brought into question in this way.  I then said that I was unwilling to proceed with any action against Mr Verryn on the basis of the evidence of only one person who had actually participated in the assaults on the other youths, and, in my view, was a totally unreliable witness.  The meeting decided that Mrs Mandela was using these allegations as a smokescreen.  \n Then another youth gave evidence.  He had once belonged to the soccer team and had left.  He related a long story about the team harassing him until they finally caught him and cut his throat with a pair of garden shears, and he indicated the recently stitched wound and said that he had been left for dead before managing to get assistance at a nearby hostel.",

And during this period Paul continued to seek information about Stompie and contacted the Temahole Civic, and we wanted to see Stompie's parents.  Thank you.",

I believe on the Friday of that week three churchmen, Father Mkhatswa, Reverend Otto Mbangula and Bishop Manas Buthulezi, visited Mrs Mandela.  She insisted on Krish Naidoo being present, and Zinzi was there, and they questioned her concerning Stompie, and she answered, \"He escaped, I don't know where he is\".  Zinzi then insisted that the full background be given rather a one sentence answer, whereupon the sexual assault allegations were once more made.  Mr Mbangula asked her why she didn't approach him, he was the Superintendent Minister of Mr Verryn, or myself, as Verryn's Bishop, when she first heard of this behaviour, and there was no answer to this question, and then Mrs Mandela said she would prepared to meet the community after her exams.",

            "Yes.  Well, on the 25th we had a meeting with our lawyer, Mr Haysom, and we were wrestling with our responsibilities towards Stompie and the advice that was given us at that time.  The legal advice was to keep the community leaders on the case, to get hold of Stompie's parents and the civic where he came from, something that Paul Verryn was already trying to do, and to continue trying to find out where he is.  It was also agreed, at that time, that Paul should ask the church officially to enquire into the allegations made against him, but this is for his own, sake of his own reputation.  So, then that was Wednesday, and then the next day I received a letter from Mr Verryn requesting that the church institute an inquiry into the allegations that were being made about his sexual behaviour. And then it was around this time that, in fact, it was the next day that the Weekly Mail was going to break the story of the abduction, which so far had not been in the press at all.   And they approached me, fairly close to deadline, and asked me to make a, to comment, because they were breaking the story, and I did give them a statement.  I've records of those statements if they are relevant or of any interest to the Commission.  And I only did so after it was clear that Mrs Mandela had attacked the church in the report that they would be publishing the next day.  That day Mr Verryn also got a telephoned death threat, anonymous.\n Do you wish me to go on to the next day, sir, or...",

And she spoke of her faith in God and the way that God had looked after Stompie in the past, and I asked her if she wished to work through our lawyers or her lawyers to bring pressure to bear for news of Stompie, and she indicated she would do this.\n Then that afternoon I released a second statement, because up to now we had not, in fact, referred to the assaults in any press statement.  We were trying to be, we tried to hold this thing as tight as we could, but I heard that Mrs Mandela had now given a television interview attacking the church, attacking the South African Council of Churches for, quote,\n\"Covering up events with the football team for the sake of overseas funding.\"\nWe have, I saw a copy of that later, and there is a lot more detail to the attacks that she made.  I found myself seeing all sorts of journalists about this, and I then went to see Beyers Naude to find out whether the Crisis Team had made any further progress.  We were becoming extremely frustrated.\n At ten o' clock I visited Mr Dominee Naude that night.  He had come back from overseas and was once more part of this Committee, and he related that on three occasions between Monday of this week, that's Monday the 30th of January and Wednesday the 1st, Winnie Mandela had agreed to meet the Crisis Committee and had cancelled at the last moment.  They had given her an ultimatum that unless she was willing to meet them plus myself on the Thursday, they would have to report to the community that they'd failed to make any headway with her.  I expressed concern that I had not been consulted about being included in the ultimatum, and asked what they hoped to achieve, and Beyers said that they would demand that she must express the willingness to hand over the football team and its affairs and its future to the Crisis Committee, and she must also agree to negotiate a solution with myself at a press conference where we would all together face the press by Friday with an agreed statement.\n I indicated I didn't believe that that would be achieved by Friday because of unanswered questions about Stompie, and Dominee Naude said we are not mandated to do the work of the church, that's up to me.  And then he gave me a copy of the NBC interview that Mrs Mandela had had and copies of press releases by certain civic associations supporting the actions of the community meeting, affirming Paul Verryn and the church, and these press releases were now in the hands of the New Nation and the Weekly Mail, and he said the Crisis Committee was attempting to block their publication for the sake of not hurting progress in negotiations with Mrs Mandela.",

I'm not a politician myself, but it was quite clear to me that the Crisis Committee was involved in damage control, as well as trying to get to the bottom of this.\n And when damage control, politically, took the upper hand, then they would move in a certain way and when the moral essence of assault and possible murder took the upper hand, then they would move in another way.

            "Well, it seemed to me that in this, that nobody now was safe from accusations by Mrs Mandela of some kind of plot and involvement against her or her husband.  She said, she denied the existence of a football team, she denied that there had been any abduction, she said that the children at her house were the same kind of children that were looked after at Paul Verryn's house, she doesn't know their identity, they don't know of any football club, she expressed surprise that Bishop Tutu, who was overseas at the time, had said that she had talked about the football team, because he knows that she has no need of bodyguards, she launched into an attack on Paul Verryn,\n\"Tragedy is the issue of Paul Verryn who has a medical problem, which needs to be addressed by responsible leaders.  Since October '88 I came across the problem which is psychological problem.\"\nI took these words down verbatim from the NBC tape.\n\"I don't understand how a man of his standing and a Christian continues to sodomise black children.  There is clear evidence that he's fallen victim to a medical problem that he should have addressed quietly with his doctors.  He brutalises these youths who are with him. Because one youth would not give in to his sexual advances that's how this arose.  It is all known in church circles and those who have been working with him.  He is supposed to have been transferred from Roodepoort because of this problem.  He is continuing with his activities with the full knowledge of some of the top members of the church.  My responsibility as a mother is to draw attention to this problem.  The youths in my premises didn't abduct any children.  It came about when a woman who was staying with Paul Verryn told me about this child and he was later fetched.  There is a gigantic cover-up by the church.\n Xoliswa brought the boys, especially the traumatised child, because she panicked when he said ...\", quote,\n\"The only way to deal with this White man is to kill him.\"\n \"The focus should have been on Paul Verryn and the SACC.  The SACC are worried about their image, because, when people discover that Paul Verryn is not very well, their overseas funding will be affected.  This is a problem of the church rather than any football team.  We thought we were assisting the church in a problem and their only interest is covering their image.\"\nThese are some of the things that were said by Mrs Mandela on that tape.  \n Later in that day I had further consultations with our lawyers and that we should, perhaps, try not to be too negative about the proposed meeting that Dominee Naude had spoken about, but that I must go into that meeting ready to confront Mrs Mandela with all the evidence that we had, especially in relation to the actions and things said by the football team around the removal of Stompie.  \n Ja, I don't know how much detail you are wanting, sir, that's why, I'd be grateful if you led me a little bit.",

            "All right.  On the Thursday I had consultations with my own Presiding Bishop and the Executive Secretary of my church about the meeting suggested that we would, we were going to have with the Crisis Team and Mrs Mandela, and they suggested we should go ahead with the meeting, provided that I go in accompanied by other representatives of my own church.  And at eight o' clock on that Thursday I met with Beyers Naude, who said there's been a change in plans.  Now he said Winnie and Naidoo are insisting on meeting the Crisis Committee without Storey first.  This meeting was set for noon.  I indicated that the Crisis Committee should come to his office.  I indicated the Crisis Committee should come to my office immediately after that meeting if it took place at all.  I wasn't optimistic.\n There was a meeting, I believe, at that time, somewhere that day between Beyers Naude, Sister Ncube, Winnie and Zinzi Mandela.  At two thirty, the Crisis Committee, consisting of Beyers Naude, Aubrey Mokoena, Sister Ncube and Sidney Mufamadi arrived, together with Krish Naidoo, and I was accompanied by the Reverend Austin Massey and, I think, the Revered Otto Mbangula.  I asked why Mr Naidoo was there.  They were in my office.  I didn't believe that Mr Naidoo belonged in the Crisis Committee.  I, frankly, was suspicious of his role in the matter, and he said \"I'm a go-between, I'm not acting for Mrs Mandela\".  \n Dominee Naude reported that they had met with Mrs Mandela earlier, and indicated one, \"If possible, we would like to see to it that misunderstandings are removed and to move forward in unity for the sake of the community, the church, the Mandela family, and Paul\".  They had conveyed to her the outcome of Crisis Committee investigations into the alleged events surround the abduction and Paul, and it was the intention of the Crisis Committee to get a meeting with the church and to tell her that the church has evidence which may or may not conflict with theirs.  They were also aware of an urgent need to report to the community, and they were reporting to me that Mrs Mandela was willing to enter into a, quote,\n\"wider discussion\",\nunquote, that's, with the Crisis Committee, the church, the Mandela family and, possibly, Ismail Ayob.  Mr Mufamadi then indicated that he had reported fully to Mrs Mandela about the encounter between the Crisis Committee and the children in custody, along the lines that I described earlier.  In other words, when they visited them in the home.  The Crisis Committee reported to her about the community meeting and what had happened there, the conflict between her claim that the children had come voluntarily and what they had said to the community meeting.  \n They also reported how Katiza had confirmed that he had not been assaulted and had participated in assaulting the others, and also that he said he saw Stompie being taken out in bad condition.  They also reported to her of their meeting with Xoliswa.  She admitted she was the one who had informed Winnie and pointed the children out when they were fetched.  She was there, also, when they denied sexual abuse and, quote,\n\"Had to be given a few klaps,\"\nunquote, to get them to admit it and it, to admit that it had happened to them.  Xoliswa had been asked whether she had actually witnessed any sexual abuse, and her answer included that Stompie had once reported to her that Thabiso had interfered with him.  Katiza had once reported to her about Paul, and Gabriel sometimes used to sleep in Paul's room.  She, therefore, assumed he was party to these activities.  \n Beyers then reported that Winnie responded about Stompie.  She was informed that the police yesterday took action in arresting, quote,\n\"an ex-Captain of the then football club\",\nunquote.  She expects that there will be further arrests. She indicated that now it was in the hands of the police, and there was little more that she or the Crisis Committee could do.  \n With regard to Katiza, she indicated she had laid a charge and it was now in the hands of the police.  She said that ...",

            "With regard to Katiza, Mrs Mandela had indicated to the Crisis Committee that she'd laid a charge.  That was a charge against Mr Verryn, I think.  It was now in the hands of the police, and she said that we now have a situation of conflicting evidence, so far as the Crisis Committee is concerned.  No definite, clear corroboration could be made of what had happened.  She pointed out that the people supposedly guilty of abduction had not yet been questioned by the Crisis Committee.  Well, the Committee then said that they wanted to convey all of this to myself, and Mr Naidoo indicated the need for a positive approach with unity being the key, and Mr Mokoena said the church should be careful not to go its way, because the church also has enemies and in order to minimise this, togetherness was required.\n Beyers Naude then reported that Mrs Mandela, after all of this, pointed to the fact that here again was an example of a situation where people, for their own ends, present possible information where it can be used against other people.  She recalled the Cilliers Commission in Brandfort where a similar thing happened. The Committee then asked her specifically with regard to the Mandela Football Club that the children be put into the care of the Crisis Committee and relieve her of the responsibility.  She was adamant that the club had been disbanded long ago.\n I was then asked whether the church would be willing to enter into a meeting of the Crisis Committee, the Mandelas, and the church.  I indicated that there wasn'thing in principle against a meeting, but I pointed out that evidence in our possession must be dealt with and that, as late as yesterday, Mrs Mandela was making damning statements about Verryn and further assassinating his character and that of the church.  Also, that today there is a story about Jerry in the newspaper in which he alleges that Stompie went with Kenny one morning and they've not been seen since.  As long as the Crisis Committee was aware that, in any meeting with Winnie, these matters would have to be addressed.\n I also took exception to suggestions that we had run to the press and pointed out that both statements issued by us had been issued only in response to major attacks on the church by Mrs Mandela, and we agreed that I would consult on Friday morning, and that a meeting date with Mrs Mandela was set tentatively for three p.m. on the Friday.  I would phone Beyers Naude at 11 a.m. to confirm or cancel that date.  \n That afternoon I and Paul went, met two Maholi representatives to tell them about the visit to Stompie's mother, and this was the day that the Business Day carried a very full statement by myself responding to the long list of allegations that Mrs Mandela had made.  I think I just need to say that, to close off this section, that on Friday we met in the hope, fully expecting to meet with Mrs Mandela and the Crisis Committee at 2.45, and Mrs Mandela failed to arrive.",

            "Well, it was just a good thing that, as Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church, from a pastoral point of view, Dr Mogoba, Bishop Mogoba was, had planned a visit to Mr Nelson Mandela.  Now, I had been told that Mr Ayob, earlier, had conveyed to Mr Mandela the essence of the facts and evidence about what had happened in the abduction and the things that followed.  I wasn't sure whether that had, in fact, been conveyed to Mr Mandela, and it just seemed that important to bring Mr Mandela up to date, in any case.  So, I provided Dr Mogoba with a 14-point list of information which I hoped he could convey to Mr Nelson Mandela, and the first question would be, did Mr Mandela get a memorandum of events from Ismail Ayob prepared for the Crisis Committee and containing church evidence?  If he did, well then, this was irrelevant.  These are the notes I've made of what I asked Dr Mogoba to do.\n Would he convey to Mr Mandela how deeply painful this has been for the church, our pastoral concern for him and Winnie, and we hope that he would see from the evidence that we didn't have any option, that events have made a simple pastoral approach impossible.  One, we knew of the abduction and almost certain murder of Stompie [end of tape side 3A] ... January. We kept it out of the media or the SAP until the story was broken by the Weekly Mail on the 20th of January.  Two, we consulted from the very beginning with the community, who asked that they be left to handle it.  \n Perhaps, I'm sorry, I need, just by way of background to this, to say one other thing.  I had heard either via Mr Ayob or Mr Haysom or somebody who had seen Mr Mandela, that Mr Mandela was concerned about my actions, and he was asking the question why could not Bishop Peter have acted, have dealt with this matter pastorally, rather than in the way he is dealing with it?  So, this explains some of what I'm trying to justify here.\n Second, we consulted from the very beginning with the community, who asked that they be left to handle it.  Thirdly, four or five meetings to discuss the ways of getting the youths back, and then, through the good offices of Ayob, and then we sought the influence of both Nelson and Tambo.  On the 16th there was the release and we believed that their intervention was decisive, and I wanted him to be thanked for that.  On the fourth, the fourth point, on the same evening the youths freely admitted, on the 16th, that they had been abducted and held and beaten and Stompie, probably, killed.  Five, we prepared a memorandum for his eyes and we believe Ayob kept it from him.  Six, through the Crisis Committee we requested a meeting with Mrs Mandela.  The first meeting was called off, the second she didn't arrive.  Seven, we sent a lawyer to Oliver Tambo to brief him and seek advice.  Oliver Tambo was adamant that Nelson must be made aware of what was happening.  Eight, we still didn't involve the police.  She did by setting the youth to lay a complaint against Paul Verryn.  Nine, the first press statement was short and crisp and the only, and we only released it when she attacked the church.  We didn't mention her or the venue of the abduction.  Ten, since then she has blamed factions in the SACC, white clerics, the SACC, informers in the National Democratic Movement, and Paul Verryn's sexual behaviour.  Eleven, about Verryn, the only evidence against him is from a compromised witness and, in any case, Verryn has an alibi.  He was away when this sex attack was supposedly took place.\n The church, I'm not sure what it means, the church colluding with SAP although she called the police.

Other contradictions are that Stompie wasn't there, he ran away, he is now alive.  This is the latest in many incidents she is implicated in high-level common-law crime.  And then the 14th point I made to Mr Mandela that our current stance was, not responding, if at all possible, to the attacks made.\n Dr Mogoba conveyed this, the essence of those points to Mr Mandela, who sent a message to me in reply via Dr Mogoba.  Dr Mogoba simply related to me his conversation, and the conversation is that Mr Mandela said,\n\"The fault is hers.

There are various aspects of your evidence where you are quoting what would have been told to you, and, I think, in this type of forum that that's what happens.  I will not attempt to deal with those issues for which you have no personal knowledge.

            "No, I will answer the second question first. These are shorthand notes, this is an exact replica of notes I made to convey to Bishop Magoba by telephone.  So the sentences mustn't be read as if they make perfect English sense.  By the time we had reached this stage in trying to deal with this crisis, I had become aware of many other incidents involving particularly the Football Team, because you can't deal with one aspect of what they are alleged to have done without then people saying, oh yes, but I mean this isn't the first time that there's this and that, and I had been to the meeting, and I had listened to somebody talk about how they had cut their throat, and so on.  So I was saying to Mr Mandela, you need to know that this is not an isolated incident.  That's the first thing.\n The capitals is simply saying to Mr Mandela, this is a common-law crime, this is not a political thing.  One understands the atmosphere we were living in and the capacity and possibility of people to do things under political pressure and for political reasons which this Commission is uncovering and dealing with all the time, and I think understanding very often why people did things.  This was a common-law crime.  This was kidnapping, and he needed to understand that this was not a political harassment going on here, or a political issue. Fundamentally it was a common-law crime.\n Now your earlier question is harder to answer, because I feel even now the dilemma that I was in when I get a message that Mrs Mandela wants to see me.  But I had made a commitment, I had made a commitment to work with the community.  I had sat listening to the Crisis Committee, consisting of people who had far, far more senior positions in the movement, people who had enjoyed much more respect in the community than I did, who had gone to that home and been completely stone-walled and had achieved nothing.  Some of them had gone as a group.  The question was whether I going alone into that place would have achieved anything.  That was one question.\n The second question was how could we achieve anything in a place where these youngsters who were still being held in captivity, what would be the usefulness of speaking with them if they were not free to speak their minds, and there was complete agreement by everybody who had been to that house that those young people were not free to speak their minds.  But I think the supreme thing was that I was not prepared to do it unless I had consulted with the community, and as it was I've indicated I had some difficulty finding the people I wanted to consult with.  I also wanted to consult with the leader of my Church, because as far as I was concerned this was changing the ball game quite significantly if I was to go in there,  and I would want some affirmation that this is the right thing to do.  My advice was ultimately, and all I could do was (...indistinct), no, do not go unless you have the community approval. It could be misunderstood.  So I didn't.  And, you know, that may have been a mistake, it may have been wrong, maybe I could have achieved their release a little earlier, I don't know, but that was the decision made, and I have to say I think I did it with the right bona fides.",

            "Yes, I would crave the indulgence of the Commission just briefly if I may.  I've been questioned for quite a long time and have had to hear that this is the first time this document has ever come to light, the investigators in the two trials never bothered to ask for it.  But I do want to do more than just respond to questions here today, and to say that I really hope and pray that these hearings will give us the truth, because throughout this saga I believe the truth has been trimmed to prevailing political whims by politicians very often, by people with political interests.  Or the truth has been suppressed because people have vanished and feared for their lives.  I really believe that to dispel this suffocating fog of silence and lies is very important for the future of this country.\n At the funeral of Stompie Seipei I said that his death was an unspeakable crime and that \"these past few weeks have probed beneath the surface of South Africa's shame\".  I notice that that's now part of the title of a book, sir, and that the journalist who wrote the book is courageously refusing to acknowledge the sources there. But that it has exposed the deeper hidden wounds these years have carved into the people's souls, and these are the wounds, sir, the erosion of conscience, the devaluing of human life, the evasion of truth, and the reckless resort to violence.  And I think that part of the painful discovery that has come to these hearings, and you will know this better than, I sir, and I frankly do not know how you people cope with what you've had to listen to over these past couple of years.  The primary cancer may be, and was, will always be the apartheid oppression, but the secondary infection has touched many of apartheid's opponents and eroded their knowledge of good and evil.\n One of the tragedies of life, sir, is it is possible to become like that which we hate most, and I have a feeling that this drama is an example of that.  And unless this fact is recognised, then all the truth will not have been told, and we will never admit to what really happened in this case, and that's why I thought the kidnapping and the murder of Stompie Seipei are important beyond the normal horror we should feel, because at one level they may have been common-law crimes, but they are also about the ruthless abuse of power, even given the latitude of a time of struggle, and they resemble far too closely the abuses of apartheid itself.  We have got a right to know that we've left that era behind, and that matter we will not know that, none of us will be (...indistinct) until there is clarity about this...[indistinct]  \n I feel whenever I have - this is the third time I've had to give evidence, it's nice not to be quite as lonely as the first two occasions, it's nice to know that other people are coming forward now to help us find the truth, but I think we need to see this in the second of the big tragedies that we've lived through in this country, has done things to people that we will never ...[indistinct],  wounded and they have hurt and they've destroyed people's ability to know the difference between right and wrong.  It is a moral tragedy, not just a political one. \n And, sir, somebody once said, it is not enough to become politically liberated, we must also become human.  This case is about becoming human again and recognising the inhumanities which some of us were capable of because of the times we used to live in.\n I want to thank this Commission and you, sir, if I may, for the words of affirmation given to my colleague and successor as Bishop, Paul Verryn.  I don't know if anyone will ever know what it is like for seven years to see your name used by the media consistently and without (...indistinct) in spite of the fact that the allegations made against him have been thrown out by two judges, that the media has never used the name of Mr Verryn without associating him with the words sodomy or rape. I think that's disgraceful, and I hope, sir, we've seen the end to that, and that this amazing Christian who served the people of this land will be able to walk from this place knowing he has been exonerated.  \n And in connection with that, sir, I want to say I admire him for the grace with which he has borne this burden.  To my knowledge, sir, everybody who has publicly accused him of these dreadful misdemeanours has withdrawn those words except one - it is my hope that before these hearings are ended that last remaining accuser will use this opportunity to withdraw her words and to take back the accusations that she made against him.\n Finally, sir, I want to also express, as I did a little earlier, my deep admiration for an understanding of the dilemma faced by the internal leaders at the time of this crisis.  I don't think anybody can with hindsight even begin to feel the pain that they had in trying to deal with this crisis and what it cost them.  And if there are those who would accuse [indistinct] others of not having acted quite as decisively as he should, or perhaps having made a decision here or there which could have been different, then I just need to try and live myself back into those moments.\n And, you know, right through this, sir, we just hoped against hope that certain people who enjoyed the respect and adulation of the people would not be directly implicated, that there would be some way in which we would discover that that wasn't the problem. The (...indistinct) drama we hoped against hope that a little boy called Stompie would turn up alive. Those were not easy days, and I just want to say thank you to those who helped me try and deal with this at the time.  Those were the things I wanted to say and I'm grateful for the time you have given me, sir.",

            "Chairperson of the Commission, commissioners and honourable guests, community leaders who are here, and the public, recently there have been confusing reports about what exactly this Mandela Crisis Committee is all about and who belongs to it.  And we'd all sorts of names which have been listed, put together as part of the Mandela Crisis Committee, and our submission is meant to explain and put on record once and for all what this committee is  all about.   Similarly, the submission of this now defunct, because it is a defunct committee, should be seen in its correct perspective, that the submission of the committee is made with the sole purpose of helping the Commission in its quest to understand the activities of the Mandela Crisis Committee in respect to the matters raised by the Commission in the letter sent to us. And the third thing we would like to say, Chairperson, is that there are aspects in the letter that has been sent to some of us which we can not account for in terms of our knowledge collectively.  The Commission therefore wishes to submit that it has no knowledge of the circumstances or facts surrounding the murder of Dr Abu-baker Asvat in 1989 and the abduction and imprisonment of Katiza Cebekhulu in 1991.  We just want to put it on record because we don't have, you know, first-hand information we can actually provide to you in that regard.  The fourth thing we'd like to say is that the committee is also in no position to discuss the activities of the Mass Democratic Movement as a collective in the matters raised above connected with the Crisis Committee.  Our function was very limited and we actually stuck to that as a collective, notwithstanding the fact that our members here were individually involved in various other committees, but we thought it's important to put that on record.  The submission contained herein represents, and we'd like to emphasise that, the best possible attempt by members of the now-defunct Mandela Crisis Committee to recollect the events which are relevant to providing an understanding of the context this Commission is looking at.  But before we give details of this submission, we would like just to express, and I would like to express that myself, our condolences to all the families affected in the matters which you are dealing with, and we take this sitting of the Truth Commission as of grave, we take it very seriously, and we feel it deals with people's lives and with people's future, with people's experiences and families.  And we'd like to treat it in that way that we give as much information as we can give the Commission in this respect.\n Chairperson, I would not read the submission because it has been submitted.  We just want to put the formation of the committee within context.  Now firstly I got a call that Mr Mandela's house was on fire, and once I got the call I remember I was leaving that very day on a break, on holiday, and I was called and I went back and went to the house, found the house burning, and I knew the consequences of the house of a leader of that nature and the family, and for that reason I then called people who were strategically placed within the community who could assist in managing the consequences of the burning of the house so that we would not have deaths and destruction, which could follow out of it, and as the submission shows the people who then came - well, at the end of that day were Mr Aubrey Mokoena, and I want to just say, because people have been associating the committee with various other people, he's a member of parliament now, he chairs the committees in parliament, but he was the national co-ordinator of the Release Mandela Campaign during those days, and a member of the national executive of the UDF, and Mr Sidney Mufamadi is now Minister of Safety and Security, and he was General Secretary of Cosatu, and now a member of the MEC of the ANC and a member of the Central Committee of the Politburo, and Sr Bernard during those days she was president of the Federation of the Transvaal Women's Organisation (FETWO) and now she is a member of parliament.   And Dr Beyers Naude has been former General Secretary of the SACC and former Director of the Christian Institute, and he has been a very, very valuable member of the community to make a contribution in this regard.  And the sixth person who's not present with us today, it's Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, who happens to have a meeting that he could not get out of, but he is now Deputy Chairperson of the National African Investment Limited, Chairperson of Johnnic, and he was former Secretary General of the ANC, former chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly, and former Secretary General of the National Union of Mineworkers.  Those six people are the ones who then came to be known as the Crisis Committee or the Mandela Crisis Committee.  We say in the submission that we were christened thus.  We never called ourselves a Mandela Crisis Committee ourselves.  In fact, if you looked at the Annexure 1 of that submission, you will realise that at the end their submissions says, \"released by the following community leaders involved it the crisis related to the burning of the Mandela house\".  And so we really never called ourselves a Mandela Crisis Committee.  The media christened us, and we ended up ourselves calling ourselves thus.  \n Chairperson, I would like to say once we had dealt with this matter of the house, which meant talking to leaders that night, and I remember up to two o'clock in the night we were knocking at peoples' houses to make sure that no violence happens in the community.  And the next thing that we did was then to look at how we restore the house to the state in which it was before because the community was angry about it, and we got involved in a process of doing that and the community assisted us in that regard.  I just want to say that this Committee was purely meant for that purpose, and what made us to stay longer is because the reconstruction of the house and repairs took longer, and we had to also take care of the accounts and the security arrangements which needed to be done at that particular time.  \n We'd like to also submit, Chairperson, because of that that other issues arose affecting the family, and because we were close at that time in dealing with the issues involving the family, we then were drawn in various other issues like the Robert Brown controversy you'll remember during those days and Mr Mandela's illness - I remember that Dr Beyers Naude was the one who wrote a letter on our behalf to President Botha during that time on that particular matter, and various other matters which arose.  \n One of those matters has to do with this alleged kidnapping of young people from the Orlando West Methodist church.  May I just say, Chairperson, that in the nature of the type of people we brought together, they were not always all together in dealing with specific aspects, and the submission does indicate that, but everybody else did so on behalf of the collective and acted in the absence of others, and the Commission will recognise that in the submission, and for that reason we are going to have a number of people then speaking on the specific issues.  I just want to say that, when the alleged kidnapping and accusations about sexual abuse were made, there was a concern in the community about where the young people were, whether they were okay, et cetera.  And we happened to be the people who were talked to say, can you deal with this matter?  And so we dealt with it by visiting the family and the submission, it's quite clear about the details there discussed with the family.  We were allowed to meet some of those boys who were there during that time, and at that time the only person we had not seen was Stompie. \n And, Chairperson, we do submit that questions were directed to the young people who were alleged to have been kidnapped, and the answers they gave us were, no, they were not kidnapped.  We asked them whether in fact they were beaten or not, assaulted or not assaulted.  They said, no, they were not assaulted.  And you will see from our submission in paragraph 26 that, when members of the committee pressed the young people about apparent injuries which were seen from them, they denied they were actually ever assaulted and they said that they incurred those injuries, I mean they suffered those injuries by falling from trees, and that was the answer they gave at that particular moment.  We asked about the whereabouts of Seipei Stompie, and whether or not Stompie was assaulted.   They replied that they did not know of his whereabouts.   They all told the committee that at no stage were they assaulted while they were at the Mandela residence.  \n After this assessment, the committee was of the view that it would be wise to persuade Mrs Mandela to let the leadership of the community to take over responsibility for the youth instead of her keeping them because of the allegations which were made.   The committee also considered the Mandela Football Club as a security risk to Mrs Mandela and her family, as the committee strongly suspected that the club was infiltrated by elements of the apartheid security establishment.   As a result, the committee advised that the club members be removed from Mrs Mandela's residence, and that alternative arrangements be made for her security.  On the 24th January 1989, I then left the country on a mission which was involving the WCC, the World Council of Churches.  On the day of my departure I raised on  behalf of the committee with the Mandela lawyers to convey an urgent confidential message to Mr Mandela in prison to apprise him about that situation, as well as to ask him to intervene to resolve the crisis.  Basically what we were trying to do was to get the club out there because we believed there was a problem there, and Mama believed that she's a social worker, these children are needy, she can't get them out of the house, and we were concerned about her security and various other issues that were involved in it, and in particular we then indicated the aspects which we thought Mr Mandela could help us in.  In the same way we also at the same time, around the same time, after I had left, communicated with Mr Tambo, the then president of the ANC, to assist us in dealing with this matter because it was a complicated matter as people who were there were members of Umkhonto weSizwe, some of them, and therefore we thought it would be helpful for the ANC to be involved in assisting in this regard.   \n Chairperson, a report was sent to Mr Tambo, and after that report a public statement was made, and all those documents are attached there, and members of the committee will speak on these matters.  But on my return, which will conclude my submission now, and I will ask members of the committee to speak on this, on my return, Chairperson, on the morning of Saturday the 18th February 1989, I received a call from Mr Tambo, the then president of the African National Congress. In this call Mr Tambo expressed his concern about the continuing reports of missing children.  At that time, I think, it was Cebekhulu who was still unaccounted for as far as the public was concerned, and asked me to visit Mrs Mandela and ask her to hand over Cebekhulu to myself so that we can in fact say to the public here he is, he is alive, et cetera.  And Mr Tambo had talked to Mrs Mandela at that time, and so when I went in that discussion had already happened, and after a long discussion, which was made difficult because of the reports to President Tambo which was then made public by the newspaper media now those few days before I went to visit - oh, the same Sunday before I visited Mrs Mandela.  It was difficult because there was a view that reports were sent in without consultations, and we had very serious discussions about it, but after those discussions we then agreed that we would then get Cebekhulu, who was then handed over to me, and I went to the press and announced that in fact he was there, and I took him to the hospital because at that time he was showing indications of ill-health which required medical attention.  \n And in conclusion the attention of this Commission is once more drawn to the statement made by this very committee in 1992 which we annexed as Annexure B.   That statement was made because there were certain allegations about the committee, and that there was knowledge of certain issues which the committee had not declared, and we made that statement.  We called again the collective, although it didn't exist as a collective of that nature, and reviewed the events of the past and wrote that statement, and that's the closest to the events at that particular time.   And the second report of course is the one that was sent to Mr O.R.Tambo.  The committee also stands ready to elaborate orally on all these issues contained in our main submission, as well as the documents annexed hereto.  And I'm going at this stage, Chairperson, to ask Mr Sidney Mufamadi to speak on some of the issues.",

            "Mr Chairman and the Commission, as Rev Chikane pointed out, I'm going to speak briefly to the documents that are attached to the main body of our submission.   We have attached to our submission a number of documents. In all, there are five: Annexure A, B, C, D and E.   I will not necessarily speak to all the annexed documents, but perhaps even before I speak to the documents that are annexed hereto, I must point out that if you look at the submission as a whole and you look at the annexed documents, especially those that were authored by this collective, you will notice that a common feature of these documents is that members of the Mandela Crisis Committee did not at any stage purport to have been material witnesses, either as individuals or as a collective to any crime that was allegedly committed.  I think it's important to point this out.  But we are of the view that, in the course of the work which we were doing as this collective, we gained some insights into the matters before this Commission today, insights which might be helpful in pointing the Commission in the direction which is likely to help the Commission discover the truth.   If for instance you look at annexure B, that is a press statement which we felt obliged to release on the 18th April 1996.  Although as a collective we were no longer meeting at that time to attend to these matters that are before the Commission today.  As I said, we were prompted to take this step by allegations and insinuations which appeared in the mass media, which we believe came from certain - at least a certain political party in the country.  Allegations to the effect that we as a collective were covering up the truth about what happened to Dr Asvat.   So I just thought that it's important for us to explain why we have this statement.   I may come back to it later. That's Annexure B.  Annexure C, that is a report which was sent by members of this committee to the late president of the African National Congress, Mr Oliver Tambo, who at the time was in exile, and it outlines these insights that I referred to earlier as we gained them.   Annexure E is a statement which was issued by the leadership of the African National Congress from Lusaka after they had received the report which appears here as Annexure C.  Rev Chikane has already said that, as a result of the insights that we gained, we formed an impression that there were serious problems with the Mandela United Football Club.  And I think if you look at the main body of our submission, and you look at the report which we sent to Mr Oliver Tambo, you will indeed see that that was our impression.  I think on page 19 of our main submission, not page, paragraph 19 rather.   Paragraph 19 of our main submission, we say - I will read that\n\"The committee insisted on removing what it considered a bush, that is the Mandela Football Club, around the Mandela family within which agents of the apartheid system were possibly operating\".\n If you look again at Annexure C which is then our report to Mr Oliver Tambo, page 2 of that document. Or let me start with the last sentence of page 1.  This is how we reported to Mr Tambo:\n\"When we interviewed Katiza Cebekhulu, he came across as a person who understood no language other than Zulu. (There must be a full stop there.)  Somewhere along  the way we gained an impression that he is a maverick.  This prompted us to concentrate on additional issues. We broke him. (Not in the physical sense.)  Consequently we established the following from him\n1. That both Gabriel (that's Gabriel Mekgwe) and Thabiso (Thabiso Mono) were heavily assaulted.  Stompie and Kenny were also assaulted. \nThat he, Katiza, was instructed to contribute in  assaulting the four, the four namely Katiza, Gabriel, Stompie and Kenny.   He was himself not assaulted. \nHe believed that Kenny had escaped, but he suspected that Stompie was dead.  \nHe, Katiza, before running away from Hammarsdale \n(Hammarsdale is in what today is known as the KwaZulu-Natal Province) He, Katiza, before running away from Hammarsdale, was working with the C.R.Swart's Security Branch. (That's what we got from him.) He maintains that he did this because of poverty.  He was, according to him, rejected by both the UDF and the Inkatha.  He reckons both organisations were after him, and he therefore decided to leave the area, namely Hammarsdale.\" \n\"It is a matter of public record that sometimes this year the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party made public statements, that is the provisional structures of these two organisations in KwaZulu-Natal, they made public statements which one can say confirm what appears there as Point 4.  Or at least they have got the same impression that Katiza had of himself as he told us.\"   \n There I was dealing with annexure C.  Coming to annexure E - or before I come to Annexure  - if you look at Annexure C -\nI'm looking for the relevant paragraph. I'm trying to - . Oh, then Franky said the paragraph immediately after what I read about Katiza. I'm just reading it as it appears in this document. \n\"Winnie later told us that she has sent both Katiza and Xoliswa to Lusaka. (Katiza Cebekhuku and Xoliswa Falati to Lusaka.) This is what prompted us to take this step of communicating with you hopefully whilst the two are still in Lusaka, because we thought that it was necessary for him to be armed with this insight that we had gained ourselves.  We had not gone public for instance about what Katiza told us about himself, but we thought that it would be necessary for the leadership of the ANC to ask him a few questions about that.  When we spoke to Katiza, he implicated Xoliswa Falati in the alleged kidnapping of the children from the Methodist church. And indeed later, when the children had come out of the Mandela residence, they  implicated Xoliswa as well at the meeting which was referred to earlier by Bishop Storey, which took place in Dobsonville. So indeed we thought that, quite apart from whatever it was that they were sent to say in Lusaka, it would have been necessary for the leadership of the ANC to know about these other allegations that were being made about the individuals concerned.\n Coming to Annexure E that, as I said earlier, was a statement issued by the leadership of the ANC from Lusaka.",

I will just quote some of the - I mean, ja, well, it was reprinted in Sechaba,  which was the official organ of the African National Congress in April 1989.  Well, at least in Sechaba you can see the date as well.  1989, it was released - printed on February 18th 1989.\n I will read some of the sentences which I think may be of relevance to the point I was making earlier.  But it's so short that you might want me to read the whole of it. [Intervention] The statement reads thus:\n\"Recently there have been serious developments pertaining to the activities of the group known as the Mandela Football Club, which have raised great concern within the mass democratic movement and struggling people as a whole. The ANC shares the concern of the people, and has all the time tried to intervene to find an amicable solution to the problem.  In the light of reports about its activities in the recent past, our organisation, complementing the initiatives of leading personalities of the mass democratic movement, tried to use its influence to bring about the disbanding of the group.\"\nThe group being the Mandela United Football Club. \n\"Unfortunately our counsel was not heeded by Comrade Winnie Mandela. The situation has been further complicated by the fact that she didn't belong to any structures and therefore did not benefit from the discipline, counselling, and collectivity of the mass democratic movement.  Under these circumstances she was left open and vulnerable to committing mistakes, which the enemy exploited.  One such instance relates to the so-called Mandela Football Club.  In the course of time the club engaged in unbecoming activities, which have angered the community.  We fully understand the anger of the people and their organisations towards this club.  We have every reason to believe that the club was infiltrated by the enemy, and that most of its activities were guided by the hand of the enemy for the purposes of causing disunity within the community and discrediting the name of Nelson Mandela and the organisation of which he is the leader. Our people should not allow this.  The ANC calls on our people to close ranks and exercise maximum vigilance against the vile machinations of the enemy.   Our position is that the problem arising from the activities of the Mandela Football Club can and must be resolved within the ambit of the democratic movement as a whole, both at local and national levels.  This must be done in the shortest possible time.  To realise this, it is necessary that Comrade Winnie Mandela is helped to find her way into the structures and discipline of the mass democratic movement.  It will be of paramount importance that she co-operates with all those involved in the resolution of the problem. We are confident that the mass democratic movement will open its doors to her in the interests of our people and the struggle.  There is a need to create a climate in which all problems facing the community, including the unfortunate death of Stompie Moeketsi Seipei, a committed young lion who has made an immense contribution in the mobilisation of our youth and people in the struggle, will be discussed to foster unity rather than let the enemy use them to achieve its ends.  The ANC takes this opportunity to convey its heartfelt condolences to the parents, relatives and community of Stompie Moeketsi Seipei.  It is with a feeling of terrible sadness that we consider it necessary to express our reservations about Winnie Mandela's judgment in relation to the Mandela Football Club, but we should not forget what Comrade Winnie Mandela has gone through and her immense contribution to the liberation struggle.  She has not only suffered the anguish of over a quarter of a century of separation from her husband, but has also experienced unending persecution at the hands of the regime such as banishment, imprisonment, torture, and sustained harassment over a period of more than two decades, bearing the name of Mandela, and in her own right she increasingly became one of the symbols of resistance to racist tyranny both at home and abroad.  We firmly believe, without prejudging all the issues which have been raised in relation to the problem, that whatever mistakes were made should be viewed against the background of her overall contribution on the one hand and the activities of the enemy on the other\". Viewed in this light, we consider it important that the movement .....\n(tape ends)\n ...will continue to work for the unity of our people and we have no doubt that all those who have participated in attempting to solve this problem have done so in the best interests of our struggle.\"\n Now, as I said earlier, we sent a report to Mr Tambo, we received a response through the same channels that we used in sending the report.  Subsequently,  this statement was issued by the leadership of the ANC.  \n\"One thing that became clear to us was that the ANC leadership in Lusaka was of the same view that there was a causal link between the unbecoming conduct of some of the members of the Mandela United Football Club and the machinations then of the enemy.   It was precisely because we had this impression that we tried what we considered to have  been our level best to persuade Mrs Mandela to allow us to help her disband the Mandela United Football Club, because, as this collective, we can't claim to have succeeded to persuade her to co-operate with us in that regard, and I must say that we regretted what we considered to be her apparent inability to see things from our perspective.  We believed that the football club was damaging to her personal integrity in terms of what people understood its members to have been involved in, and to the extent that there was a perception that she was part of the Mass Democratic Movement.  Indeed we thought that the fact of the continued existence of the Football Club impacted negatively on the fortunes of the Mass Democratic Movement.\n The statement by the leadership of the ANC, as we saw, it was appealing to members of the Mass Democratic Movement not to give up the attempt to solve the problems amicably.  We understood also that they were addressing an appeal to us as this collective not to give up that task.  Because if you look at our report to Mr Oliver Tambo, we were actually posing the question whether any useful purpose would be served by the continued existence of this collective and the work that we were trying to continue to do.\n We also interpreted this statement as addressing an appeal also to Mrs Mandela that she should co-operate with efforts that we were making, co-operate with efforts which the leadership of the ANC was imploring the rest of the Mass Democratic Movement to make. \n Mr Chairman, I should not take your interrogation time.

            "There are two things that I would like to add Chairperson. Just to put it on record because at the beginning we say that we are not able to deal with specific issues that are related to the murder of Dr Abu-Baker Asvat and if I can take you to paragraph 33 of the submission, the background to that paragraph is that during the time when we were talking to those young people in that Diepkloof residence we were told that Dr Asvat had treated and that the sexual abuse story he would be able to actually assist on the sexual abuse story and so in Paragraph 33 you see on the 14th January 1989, three members of the Committee Aubrey Mokoena, Sidney Mufamadi, and Sister Bernadette Ncube visited Dr Asvat, that was the encounter that this Committee has with Dr Asvat in Robville Surgery on behalf of the Committee, I wasn't in the country, Dr Beyers Naude wasn't in the country and Cyril Ramaphosa wasn't available.\n The task of these members was to ask Dr Asvat as to whether or not he had treated the youth and whether or not he could share with the Committee what his findings were because that was important for us and that story is related in Annexure B in a much more detailed form in terms of what was required and extracted and the members of the Committee who went there report that Dr Asvat denied every having seen or medically examined the youth and that is stated in Annexure B.\n Annexure B was written around this particular question because it was felt that because the members of the Committee were the ones who visited Dr Asvat before his death and talked to him about these young people, that the Committee would have information, Dr Asvat would have communicated to them and you will realise that in Annexure B where reference is made to the report which was sent to the President of the ANC at that particular time.\n Now if you can take that Annexure C which was quite confidential which made Mama Mandela quite angry about, in terms of how it was actually sent to President Mambo. But Annexure B refers to that report and says that \"If indeed we have extra information that was very confidential\" because this was a very confidential document sent by a Courier. A human being had to go there and deliver it and came back and confirmed it's delivered and if there was any extra information we could have given that would have been the best opportunity.\n Unfortunately the answer that we got at that time was \"No, I did not treat them\" and that created a crisis for us. We are not able to comment why that issue was treated in that way. I need to add, Chairperson, that I personally had a very close personal relationship with Dr Asvat and I got the call, I was in Japan at that time, and got a call that he has been killed and he came to rescue me when I was supposed to leave school, the University, because my parents were not working, and I assisted the family for two years. Basically giving grants to the family and treated the family free of charge, so he was my personal doctor particularly, and this has been a pain to us, but we, unfortunately that's as far as we could go.\n There was other interaction which happens beyond that I know of. Of course when I came back from outside the country, he was already dead, so I had no opportunity to can do that.\n The next thing Chairperson, is Paragraph 34. Just to put the context of all these reports which Mr Mufamadi has been referring to, that there was a meeting at Dobsonville, which was called and members, and I am sorry that Bishop Storey there has made a real story, rather than with an ease of, there is a typographical error there and we apologise for that. \n In that meeting Sr. Bennett and Mr Sidney Mufamadi attended that meeting where they were invited, they invited members the Crisis Committee and it's in that meeting where very hard things were said, so that reports which tends to be misunderstood in terms of what was that which the Committee believed was true and what is that which was reported as what the community was saying, which I think it is important to read it carefully in that sense that it reported quite some anger from that meeting, angry things were said and there were recommendations of what the community must do and what the African National Congress was saying is that you must not fall into that trap because of this infiltration you are actually then achieving the very objective, so instead of isolating Mrs Mandela, close in on her and deal with the problem and that is the context within which that counts and that is as close as we could come in a broader meeting with the Mass Democratic Movement, because it was community organisations present there.\n I would like to turn your attention again to Paragraph 14, Chairperson, which has been referred to and would like to refer to some of the issues we believed after the burning of the house, are well involved here.\n Paragraph 14 on Page 4. \"Although the events leading to the burning of the house was sad to be related to conflict between members of the so-called Mandela Football Club and some members of the community, the Committee intuitively felt that there was a third force involved in this conflict. The Committee suspected that the objectives of this third force were firstly to create conflict within the community and thereby shift the focus of the people's energies away from the struggle for liberation.\"\n And the second objective of the third force so the Committee suspected was to discredit not only Mrs Mandela but also the ban?? Imprison Mr Mandela and the African National Congress and the total affect of this strategy would be to weaken the Liberation Movement and finally defeat the forces of liberation. That is how we conceptualise it, you would see this struggle in trying to deal with this plan and at one stage when I visited the house during the night because there was an emergency, I myself, didn't feel safe leaving the house after that, because I didn't know who in amongst those boys were actually serving the regime at that particular time, and that I think is important to understand, Chairperson.",
