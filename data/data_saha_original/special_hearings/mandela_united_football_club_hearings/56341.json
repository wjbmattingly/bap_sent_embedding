            "Yes, that is correct.  We grabbed Lerothodi and took him with.  Lerothodi knows me very well, but he did not know the rest of the group.  He asked me to leave him so that he can walk all on his own.  I told him that Mommy wanted to see him.\n And I could see that he was scared.  We went into a certain house at Muzimuhle, that is Lerothodi's girlfriend's place.  I spoke to Moses and said he should look out so that he can confirm that nobody was following us.\n I went back into the house, took Lerothodi.  I used his other name, soccer name, Master, and Lerothodi was asking me as to why we were taking the route that we took.  He asked me please, don't kill me.  And Isaac had the pair of garden shears.  Lerothodi managed to escape and we chased him and got hold of him.  Isaac was having this pair of shears.\n We started assaulting Lerothodi.  We took him just underneath the bridge, next to the railway station.  We were not going to the Stompie spot.  We grabbed him.\n I instructed Pelo to hold one hand and each and every one of them had a part to grab and get hold of.  They threw him down to the ground.  And they tried to stab him, but I said they weren't doing a professional job.  \n I took the pair of garden shears.  I stabbed Lerothodi on the neck and when I pulled the pair of garden shears, I could see Lerothodi gasping for breath and blood was coming out of his mouth.  I realised that he wasn't yet dead.\n We took him and threw him into a shallow grave.  I gave Pelo and Thabiso some money and instructed them to go to Diepkloof.  Kenny and myself took the opposite direction.",

Her first response was, Who is this?  I continued, Kuki Zwane.  Her response was, Who is Kuki Zwane?.  I continued, she's also known as Priscilla Massell, or Masio.  Do you know her at all?\n Her response was, ..oh, there is I think.  I recognised that name.  It was included in the allegations that were made to my daughters.  That was one of the killings I heard of for the first time, and that girl had been killed and information to Fivas, it was one of the names  that were mentioned at the time and I heard for the first time that she was  dead then.   I continued, Do you know her at all?   Her response was,I knew her vaguely as one of the children who were in and out of my house.  I cannot remember her.  \n I asked: Who was she friendly with,..and I continued why was she coming to your house? Her response was:  They visited each other all the time, I mean those boys were visited by all sorts of people.  I also mentioned that Kuki Zwane had gone to see Dr Asvat with Katiza.  \n Mrs Madikizela-Mandela denied that.  I asked was Kuki Zwane a personal friend of your daughter?  \n Her answer was:  No, not to my knowledge.  I asked her, when was the first time you heard of Kuki Zwane's death?  The response was.  I heard when my daughters were called by their father, and they were told that that was one of the deaths.  It was not only the Asvat killers who were supposed to be mentioned then.  This particular name was also one of the names.  \n Fivas was suppose to put all this deaths together, including the death of this child.  I asked her.  Jerry Richardson alleges that he was responsible for the murder of Kuki Zwane , and he was acting on your instructions.  \nWhat is your comments on that?  Her response was:  I heard for the first time from you, not even that information which had reached us at the time identified Richardson as a killer.  I was merely told that that child had been killed, and that would make it possible for me to be implicated in her death.\n I heard for the first time from you people that Richardson was a killer.\n My question:  Was Kuki Zwane ever a resident in your house?   No, no girl was a resident at my house, it was only the boys  at the back.\n Now these were the answers that we got from Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela when we had the in camera enquiry.  \n My first question is:  Did Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to the best of your knowledge know Kuki Zwane?",

They then stopped a police vehicle, they made a report to the police vehicle, the police vehicle continued to look for these people but were not able to track them down.  \n That is what I'm trying to explain, the differences in Dlamini's statements and his explanations in his statements and the difference between that and the statement of Mbatha, caused me as the investigating officer to believe the version of Mbatha rather than the version of Dlamini.

I have with me a copy of the visitors book at death row and it is indicated that on the 18th of December 1989, I did have meeting with certain prisoners.\n I saw Dlamini and I said to him - in view of the death sentence which might in fact be effective, whether he would not be willing to assist us with regard to the allegations made by himself against Mrs Mandela - he refused.  I also spoke to Mbatha separately and Mbatha said to me that he would stick with his story.  I asked him specifically with regard to the allegations of Dlamini against him in the trial and what he said to me was that it was a bunch of nonsense and that he would stick to his story - I then left.",
