            "Chairperson, you have given me the permission to make a short statement which has nothing to do with this particular hearing, but which impacts upon the life and work of the Commission and with your permission, I would like to make the following statement.\n The Amnesty process which is taking place in South Africa was borne in controversy, there were those who urged that there should be no amnesty whatsoever, and on the other hand there were many who demanded that there should be a general amnesty without any hearings or any applications whatsoever.\n Parliament in its wisdom decided that there would be a limited amnesty, but that applications would have to be made and would have to be either dealt with administratively or heard in public, depending on the nature of the offence.\n Amnesty was granted to Trevor Tutu on Friday of last week and many of the criticisms directed by especially political parties, and organisations, of the Amnesty Committee's decision, are I believe misdirected and based on remarkable ignorance of the amnesty process.\n I want to distinguish Mr Chairperson, between division, disagreement on an amnesty decision which is fair game, the public have every right to express their views about whether someone has been given amnesty or someone hasn't been given amnesty, and we've had that.  We will continue to have that.\n But where the Commission takes the strongest exception is with those who have dared to suggest  that the Chairperson of this Commission interfered with or influenced the amnesty process in any way.\n I need hardly add that Archbishop Tutu in the view of the Commission, and I would suggest the vast majority of people in South Africa, is a man of absolute integrity and would never resort to seeking special treatment for his son's application.\n I want to underline that it was the political parties in Parliament who decided that the Amnesty Committee would be autonomous, which means that we as a Commission have no decision and no involvement in any of the applications that are made.\n As far as Trevor Tutu's application was concerned, neither the Chairperson or any other of us on the Commission, ever saw that application.  It goes directly to the Amnesty Committee.\n Those political parties and organisations and individuals who even suggest that Archbishop Tutu influenced that decision, I believe owe a public apology to the Chairperson and to the Commission and I hope very much that those apologies will be forthcoming today.\n I want to conclude by saying that it is perfectly understandable if people wish to debate the merits or otherwise of any application, that is their right, but any suggestion that either the Chairperson or any of the Commissioners had any influence over that particular application, is simply untrue and should be desisted from being stated immediately, thank you.",

            "I was at the surgery, carrying on with my duties which included admitting patients and writing out their details on the cards.  Some time in the mid-morning it could be at about 11h00, two young men came in and one of them wished to see the Doctor.  As the Doctor had not yet arrived, I wrote out a card, took out a urine sample from the one who wanted to see the Doctor, with him.\n It was a standard procedure that we took finger prints of male patients.  I took the finger prints of this patient.  May I mention at this stage, that I do not recall the name of the men.  When the Doctor finally arrived, some time during the mid-day, started attending to the patients in the order in which the cards were placed, which was the normal first come, first serve.\n When the young man's turn came for him to see the Doctor, he was not in the queue and upon enquiry, the other patients told me that he had gone with his friend to buy cigarettes.  At about 16h00, all the patients had been attended to.  However, there were two women that the Doctor had referred to Baragwanath hospital who were still in the surgery, waiting for an ambulance to come and fetch them.  \n I was at this time busy in the dispensary, which was situated at the back of the building.  It is at this stage when the two young men came to me in the dispensary, still wishing to see the Doctor.  When I asked them where they were, they said they had gone to buy cigarettes.\n I then went to the front portion of the building towards reception and the Doctor's examining room, and the two young men accompanied me.  When I knocked on the Doctor's door, to advise him of the patient's presence, they took seats at reception.\n The Doctor told me he would see them and I left them in the reception and went to the dispensary at the back.  I heard the Doctor's voice calling the patient by name and heard the examining room's door click as this was a security door which could only be unlocked by pressing a button from inside.\n I do not know what happened there, but as there was silence after the click, I assumed the Doctor was busy with the patient.   After about ten minutes, I heard a bang that sounded like a gun shot.  I shouted \"Abu\", I thought perhaps he might be doing something.  There was no response.\n Then I heard a second shot follow - bang, similar to the first one.  This time there was also a scream by Dr Asvat.  I recognised his voice, I then ran through the back door, which was the near door to the outside.\n I screamed for help and people came running from practically all directions.  Others jumped the fences into the yard of the surgery.  When I went to the front side of the building, of the surgery, the ambulance which had come for the two patients who were still in the surgery, was arriving.  I also spotted the two young men running out of the yard, wielding something like a firearm.  The ambulance people saw the drama and chased the fleeing young men.\n I then went into the surgery, through the front door and the Doctor's examining room's door was open and when I went inside the door, Doctor inside.  When I went inside, the Doctor was lying face down and bleeding from the left side of his chest.\n Shortly thereafter the police arrived and the ambulance people returned and advised that the young men disappeared into the park which was near by.\n The ambulance personnel then took the patients to the hospital.  Dr Asvat at this stage was no more alive.  I phoned the Doctor's brother who then came to the surgery where the body was still lying.  The body was removed in the early evening of that afternoon, to the mortuary.\n Two days thereafter the police fetched me from home, they wanted keys to the surgery and asked me questions.  I went together with the police to the surgery and then to the police station where I together with the ambulance personnel, assisted the police with the drawing of the identikits.\n Some days later, I was called to an identity parade at the Maroga police station and I identified the young men I admitted.  Although I was the President of the UDF at the material time, I was for most of the time in prison, under house arrest and could not participate in the activities of the mass democratic movement at the Mandela Crisis Committee.\n I however, wish to state that all matters you have raised with the exception of matter (d), were never discussed in my presence by the mass democratic movement or any of the structures.",

I have watched, and heard your evidence under oath today, and I take account of your replies.\n And as it is our task as we sit here, we form impressions about the witness, about the manner in which a witness gives his or her evidence and I don't want to leave this room and you leaving the witness stand without you having had the benefit of my prima facie impression, and it is the following:\n My initial impression and it can be changed by all other evidence that might come from Mrs Mandela and from any other evidence, but my impression as I sit here is that you are trying your very best to say as little as possible, anything that might implicate Mrs Mandela.

I don't think it would be proper for me to come and tell lies here.\n As Mrs Sisulu, some of you know very well, under what hardship I went through during the previous regime.  From 1964 I was arrested for five years and before even that expired, I was given ten years house arrest in that house.  I was relieved in 1983 when I had a few months working with Dr Asvat, because I was on pension on 1982 from the City Health of Johannesburg.\n From that time, there was a blanket lifting off - blanket orders, I was given only four months on that relieve, when there was that blanket lifting of the banning orders.  And from there, there was a funeral of a member in my area, where I gave you know, a speech.  I was arrested in 1983, kept in Diepkloof prison for so many months.\n Even when I was elected in Cape Town when they were launching the UDF, I was in prison.  1984, it is when my case ended, sentenced to four years imprisonment, two years suspended for five years.\n I appealed the case, I came out on bail of R1 000-00.  Before my appeal in 1984 was heard, I was arrested for treason (indistinct), which took place in 'Maritzburg.  In your own way of thinking, what would I know much in that area.\n People used to come to me, hiding because they couldn't be openly talking to me.  I could not speak to Mrs Mandela because we were both banned.  It would mean taking me to jail again.  If the harassment I was under, if any one of you know even when I have to visit my husband in Robben Island, the police would keep the appointment until the following day when I was supposed to see him,  the next day and from there, 1976, 1986 when I won the case of the treason trial, I was given five years house arrest.  Five years which ended up a day before my husband entered his gate when he was released.\n When would I have time, when would I have anything to do with anything, when I could not even meet the people?  My organisation which is the UDF, I congratulate them, because despite all that, they used to sneak in and inform me about what is happening.\n And when we drew up the statement, we distanced ourselves from the Mandela Football and Mandela actions with the Football, that was terrorising the township.  They wouldn't come there as a Committee.  So, even if I am shielding Mrs Mandela, I am not here to tell lies.  I am going to tell exactly what I know and what I have seen.\n Dr Asvat was my child.  If he had anything to do with the Mandela's besides what is normal, he wouldn't come and tell me.  He never told me that is why I said in this paper when I was interviewed, had he told me all this, he wouldn't have died.\n What else would Albertina Sisulu do?

You see I also watched the documentary and your evidence on that documentary was extremely powerful, simply because of who you are and the integrity that you hold.  \n Now according to this documentary which I watched and I know I have the transcript in front of me, the interviewer Fred Bridgeland, said after asking you about Dr Asvat, and you were saying what a good man he was, and a lot of people left owing him money and you know that because you were responsible for dispensing the cards and the medicine, and then he says to you on the question of the cards, can I show you a card from the surgery and you say yes.\n And according to him, the card that he shows you is the card with Katiza Cebekhulu's name on it.  And he asks you is that your writing on the top and you say -\n\"Yes, that is my handwriting.  Is that Dr Asvat's writing, yes, it is his writing, and that date, yes, I take the name of the patient, the date here and then stamp the card for that date.\nAll I was doing was to dispense the cards and stamp, I put the stamp.  The card is dated the 30th of the 12th, 1988\".\n Now, forgive me for going over this again, but it is difficult for me to understand why you should say that then and why you should say now today in answer to questions, that you have no knowledge of Cebekhulu ever coming to the surgery and that it is not your handwriting and you didn't put the stamp there.\n Whereas on the documentary you said you did all these things, can you explain to me why there is a contradiction between what you have said then because this was a video that was seen right throughout South Africa and the newspapers commented the next day, it was big news.  It wasn't done in a hole in the corner.\n Did you ever deny that you ever said that, did you make a statement to that effect or please help me?",

Mrs Madikizela-Mandela, no that is nonsense, Mr Chairman.  I saw Mr Asvat, Dr Asvat once when I took Cebekhulu.  I asked did you see Dr Asvat at all in January 1989 besides the time you took Cebekhulu.  Answer, I have no recollection of seeing him again.  Question, so the last time you saw Dr Asvat before he was killed, was on the 30th of December 1988?  Answer, I last saw Dr Asvat to my  memory when I took Cebekhulu to him.  Question, do you know what date that was?  Answer, I said I would have to refresh my memory, I cannot remember those dates so long ago, but it was at the end of the year.\n So on Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's own evidence, she did at the end of 1988, she wasn't clear on the exact date, at the end of 1988, she did go and see Dr Asvat with Katiza Cebekhulu.

If my learned friend misunderstood me as saying I was representing Mr Dlamini as well, that was a misunderstanding.  Mr Mbatha expected himself to be the next witness as you yourself did too Mr Chairperson.\n All of a sudden while there was the interchange of witnesses and Mrs Sisulu was stepping down I was suddenly called to come and consult with Mr Mbatha in the witness's room.  These were my instructions that Mr Mbatha - who has been willing to testify has been here everyday since this Commission began, had noticed this morning two things, first of all his family had for the first time come here to support him and to be with him - they haven't been here at all Mr Chairperson.  \n Secondly, he had noticed the presence of a number of MK's as he called them to me - as he described them to me.  He himself Mr Chairperson, has not much to fear because we know at the end of the day he's going back to prison Mr Chairperson but what he does fear very much is testifying in front of these people and allowing his family to leave the Commission tonight because he fears very much for their safety.  \n Now, in discussion with my learned friend the suggestion was muted that I put the request to you Mr Chairperson, for some form of witness protection for those members of his family and with respect, who have every right to be here today to hear him give his evidence Mr Chairperson.",

I have read the Act - clearly if he has any legitimate basis for the belief that he's now articulating, there are criminal prosecutions which he can start himself without necessarily going into what I believe is just a sensationalism.  \n He's not even disclosing to yourselves Chairperson, that this is the basis upon which he holds that view and to call for your ruling.
