            "Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman we come from \ndifferent backgrounds and we come from different launching pads.  I have \nlistened to the witnesses that have appeared before you since yesterday \nmorning.  The document I had prepared I had made available to your staff \nyesterday morning because I knew given the evidence that you were about to \nreceive I would be tempted to change it.  I have not changed my document, \nthis is how I felt yesterday and I stand by my statement and you will just have \nto bear with me, I hope, as I present it to you now.  \n May I further say that I had, listening to Mr Botha and Mr Vlok \nyesterday, I had the privilege of working with both of them for three and a \nhalf years, 18 months with Mr Vlok, which was a privilege, two years with Mr \nBotha, which was also a privilege and my colleague right next to me and I \nhave seen many sunsets and many sunrises in battle, and I am pleased to be \nassociated with him from this position.   \n I, however, will say what I have to say off my own bat and I don't hold \nany of them accountable for what I am saying.  I say that for my own account.  \nI do remember, Mr Chairman, Abraham Tiro.  Many years ago I took a \nresolution never to forget his tragic death.  In life he introduced me to the \nrealities of South Africa.  In his death his memory never allowed me to forget \nthe tragedies of South Africa.\n I remember Mr Chairman the first time we met.  You were kind enough \nto make mention of an area that we share, those were the days of isolating \nBotha in his laager, making this country ungovernable.  We are not afraid to \ninherit a wasteland.  Those were the days of states of emergency, emergency \nregulations and the steps taken under those regulations that we thought were \nnecessary to save life and property.  I remember saying to you then, during \nthat encounter Mr Chairman, that the political climate was such at the time \nthat many people would not understand the fact that we were even speaking to \neach other.  To the government and National Party establishment you were a \nsanctions activist and a political trouble-maker.  \n I proudly remember, Sir, that I was appointed to this position, and I \ntake it it was because of this position that I am here today, by Mr Botha as \nDeputy Minister of Law and Order.  I think kindly of him and believe that he \ndeserves credit for major initiatives.  Those were the days of the Homburg \nhats, I hated that, but I loved my work.  I remember Sir, proud soldiers and \npolicemen now on their knees in front of the Amnesty Committee, I cannot \ncondone those violent unlawful acts, but nor can I condemn the persons.  I \ncannot disown them.  We were on the same side and fought for the same cause, \nnamely law and order as we saw it, and also to ensure that this country would \nnot be made ungovernable.  Power was not be wrested from us in a \nrevolutionary manner.  I cannot disown any of those men and women who were \non our side.\n I do not believe that individually or collectively I ever took a decision \nthat cannot stand the test of daylight here today.  Every decision was taken \nwithin the ambit of the law as it was known then.  The law may be criticised \ntoday and I will certainly agree and concede that that law will not stand the \ntest of constitutional scrutiny at this juncture.  However, that was the law of \nthe land.\n I further do not believe that the political defence of I did not know.  I \nwant to delete the WE and I want to delete the US.  I said I speak of my own \nbat.  I further do not believe that the political defence of I did not know is \navailable to me, because in many respects I believe I did not want to know.  I \nam afraid I am deleting and amending that sentence to that effect.\n In my own way I had my suspicions of things that had caused \ndiscomfort in official circles, but because I did not have the facts to \nsubstantiate my suspicions or I had lacked the courage to shout from the \nrooftops, I have to confess that I only whispered in the corridors.  That I \nbelieve is the accusation that people may level at many of us.  That US is not \ndeleted.  We simply did not, and I did not confront the reports of injustices \nhead-on.  It may be blunt but I have to say it.  Since the days of the Biko \ntragedy right up to the days of hostel activities, hostel atrocities in the late, \nlate eighties, as we went up to the record of understanding the National Party \ndid not have an inquisitive mindset.  The National Party did not have an \nenquiring mind about these matters.  We have to applaud, and we have to give \ncredit to Mr F W de Klerk for the actions he had taken to appoint the Harms \nCommission and to appoint the Goldstone Commission.  I simply believe that \nit is a pity that there is not a collective political and moral acceptance of \nresponsibility forthcoming from the quarters from which I emanate.\n It became clear from evidence before the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission that even sharply probing judges had been wilfully misled in \nmany cases by key security forces personnel.  Not surprisingly some \nindividuals had done the same to gullible politicians not excessively keen to \nask pointed questions.  Eugene de Kock's recent claim in his amnesty bid I \nsubmit is correct, namely, that any National Party politician or supporter, I \nmay add, at the time who believed that we held power because of persuasion \nand not through coercion was out of touch of reality to put it mildly.\n With the benefit of hindsight I now believe that we had failed the \nsecurity forces because we did not offer this country a viable constitutional \nvision to end the conflict.  And secondly, that the relationship between the \nsecurity forces and the National Party politicians, as a collective, in general, \nwas not an open transparent one, and therefore we did not manage the security \nforces Intelligence services properly.  If we had managed them properly you \nwould not have had to listen to evidence on the one hand they, believing that \nthey acted with authority, us telling you that we did not grant the authority \nwhich they believed that they had had.  But that has been the subject of a long \ndebate and will continue to be debated in front of your Commission.\n The observation made by the Commonwealth group of Eminent Persons \nin their report on page 65 dated the 7th of June 1986, I repeat \nJune 1986, I submit is correct.  \"We are left with the impression \nof a divided government, yet even the more enlightened \nMinisters whom we met seemed to be out of touch with the \nmood in the black townships.  The rising tide of anger and \nimpatience within them and the extent of black mobilisation and \nso of course are the great generality of white South Africans, \nonly some ten percent of whom we were told have ever seen \nconditions in a township.  Put in the simple way the blacks have \nhad enough of apartheid.  They are no longer prepared to submit \nto its oppression, discrimination and exploitation.\n They can no longer stomach being treated as aliens in their own \ncountry.  They have confidence, not merely in the justice of \ntheir cause but in the inevitability of their victory.\n Unlike the earlier periods of unrest and government attempts to \nstamp out protests there has been during the last 18 months no \noutflow of black refugees from South Africa.  The strength of \nblack convictions is now matched by a readiness to die for those \nconvictions.  They will therefore sustain their struggle whatever \nthe cost.  The campaign against collaborators and the ruthless \nelimination of agents of white authority will continue.  More \nand more black townships will be rendered ungovernable and \nthe process of creating popular structures of self-government \nwithin them will gather momentum.  The number of street and \narea committees will increase and their functions will \nprogressively\".\n So far the quote of the Eminent Persons Group.  Those were the very \nreasons why it was imperative to launch constitutional negotiations and bring \nit to finality.  To many of us this became a dream of which we never lost \nsight.  Some of us, on both sides of the political divide, however, still had to \nlearn and others are still learning the Chris Hani truism once expressed to me \n \"We concede the fact that we never broke the back of the South \nAfrican Defence Force and South African Police, but you must \nconcede the fact that you never broke the spirit of liberation in \nthe townships\".\nTo my mind this was the basis of the political settlement.\n When the epilogue of the interim constitution was finally accepted at a \nvery late stage in the negotiation process which gave South Africa its new \ndemocratic dispensation many of us gave a sigh of relief.  The relief we felt \nwas for the fact that we could have the full truth out in the open without \nvengeance.  A country has to know its history.  We hurt one another and the \ntime has come for healing.  \n I believe had it not been for that milestone judgment of Justice \nMahomed in the Azapo case brought against the State President we would not \nhave had the situation which we have today as Justice Mahomed had said in \nthat judgment that we were moving away from the shame of the past to the \nhope of the future, and that that epilogue had granted him the opportunity to \nmake the judgment which he did, and that is why we are all here, and that is \nwhy we had felt the relief at that particular moment in December 1993.\n With the National Party government the question of amnesty and the \ninevitability of a Commission probing the past was never the subject of \npenetrating debate where one and all expressed their expectations or anxieties \nopenly.  Everybody had played their cards close to the chest and discussions \nin this regard were inconclusive, often resulting in lobby discussions.  This \nalways left me with a feeling of discontent.  \n I don't feel as if I am in the dock today, and I don't feel as if I am \nbeing charged with anything which I had done, criminally or otherwise.  I \ndon't believe that I am pleading for my innocence here today.  I participate in \nthese proceedings gladly, openly, but that particular paragraph does make me \na little bit angry in the sense that I would have loved to have seen the State \nSecurity Council, as it functioned on which I served as a coopted member \nunder the Chairpersonship of Mr P W Botha today, deal with the accusations \nthat we have to answer here.   \n And I believe that it is a pity that, excuse me for saying this about two \ngreat men of this country, namely Mr Botha and Mr de Klerk, that they have \nhad their squabbles with one another that we are not today standing here in \nfront of you as a coordinated team of the Security Council.  \n And that is the next point I make, namely, that the National \nManagement System has had as its prime function the coordination of State \nactivities, and yet listening to the evidence of all of us our actions, we are not \nhere as a coordinated team under the chairmanship of our leaders, the leaders \nbeing Mr Botha who was the Chairperson of that State Security Council and \nthe leader of the National Party Mr de Klerk at that time.   And you will \nrecall and I remember that Mr de Klerk had said at his appearance where I was \npresent, that he had done his utmost to consult and to coordinate, but the facts \nspeak differently.  The facts speak that the officials are talking in one \ndirection, we are talking in another direction and the leaders, the Chairpersons \nof this, the Chairperson of the Security Council and Mr de Klerk who \ninherited the leadership did not successfully mould all of us into one team as \nwe are.  But I continue to speak of my own bat.\n I believe that there is a direct link between the National Management \nSystem, the Harare Declaration, Mr de Klerk's February speech, the agreed \nconstitutional principles that formed the basis of our constitution and the \nsigning ceremony of our constitution on the 10th of December 1996 in \nSharpeville.  \n The National Management system was a holding operation to ensure \nthat negotiations are launched and that the constitutional order was changed \nthrough the ballot box and not through the barrel of a gun.  That was \nparamount in our minds.  It was foremost in our minds.  \n The Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group in its document on page 42 \nsays it all -\n \"No serious person we met was interested in a fight to the \nfinish.  All favoured negotiations and peaceful solutions\".\n General Viljoen in evidence before you said that this was a dirty war, \nand in many respects it was.  People were forced to drink cooking oil; people \nwere forced to eat raw fish and raw meat; and on the other hand there were \nmen with balaclavas from nowhere assaulting innocent citizens and those \nanswers have not yet been found to my satisfaction or to my mind how that all \ncame about.\n The Harare Declaration, to continue in this thread, proposed steps to \ncreate a climate for constitutional negotiations.  In the words of an ANC \ndiscussion partner, partners, they had to deal with the fact that it was not \nviable to storm Pretoria with smoking guns and in this way take over power.  \nThe door for constitutional principles to form the basis for the final \nconstitution and to facilitate the transitional process was opened in this \ndocument.  I regret that typing error.  On the 2nd of February speech was a \nstatesman's response to his constituency's aspirations that the conflict and \npolitical stalemate should be ended.\n I want to add that if there ever was a civilian in our ranks that was Mr \nF W de Klerk.  I know people accuse him of many things but I will be untrue \nif I don't publicly state that in our ranks the civilian was F W de Klerk, \nalways, always warning and saying don't allow yourselves to be militarised.  \nThat was F W de Klerk.  The first one to disband the National Management \nSystem was F W de Klerk because he had always felt uneasy with that system.\n The signing ceremony of the final Constitution on the 10th of \nDecember 1996 in Sharpeville was symbolic, but it also signalled the fact that \nafter 48 years, to that day, namely the 10th of December 1948, South Africa \nwas now in step with the universal declaration of human rights.\n I conclude by saying I am both an African and an Afrikaner.  I am a \nliberated Afrikaner.  I am also a proud Afrikaner.  Liberated Afrikaners took \nthe reform bit firmly between their teeth when it was necessary.  Both our \nhearts and our minds have been changed.  We love this country.  We have been \nliberated from the baggage of an immoral system of government.  Afrikaners \ncan now resume their journey, galloping into the future, constructively \ncriticise and participate in the affairs of State.  Afrikaners can now hold the \ngovernment accountable and support it where their actions merit it, campaign \nfor a Volkstaat if they so wish, argue for the respect and recognition of \nAfrikaans without the baggage of the past.\n I can think of no reason why Afrikaans-speaking South Africans and \ntheir children, or any other Afrikaner, from the cradle to the grave should bear \nthe burden of apartheid.  With the framework of the Constitution we will \nstrive for our place and we will fight for Afrikaans.  It is right that the book \nof the past should be opened and must be interpreted, but then we must also \nclose them.  We dare not forget what has happened here, and I am not saying \nwe should close the books and forget, but we should stop holding each other \nhostage in regard to the past and then bully each other mentally.  In this way \nwe will never build a country.\n We have reached the end of a journey on a road marked by pitfalls, \npolitical doubts and obstacles.  However, the journey always carried forward, \nthe road often became one of tight hairpin bends because I was afraid of \nnegotiating the evils on bareback. I am now more than ever convinced that \napartheid was a terrible mistake that blighted our land.  South Africans did not \nlisten to the laughing and the crying of each other.  I am sorry that I have \nbeen so hard of hearing for such a long time.",

I think that is the one category. \n And then I am also saying that it could have also happened as a result \nof over-eagerness on the side of the person that he or she had gone too far as a \nresult of that over-eagerness and interpreted the mandate beyond what was \nactually a reasonable sort of mandate.  But the distinction between that and \nthe third bullet to my mind lies in the fact that the third bullet deals with \nsome cases that have become known, cases that have already served before the \ncourt, where to my mind it deals with situations where the person acted on his \nor her own agenda.  There is a clear distinction, to my mind, between the two.  \n I am not saying the first one, that is the second bullet for that matter, \nnecessarily presents one with a clear answer, and therefore I refer to it as a \ngrey area.

The policy simply was since the days of Mr \nJohn Vorster that . . . (indistinct)  the highest law of the land would be the \nsecurity of the land, that had to do with the first detentions of people 90 days, \n80 days. 16 years later, I was in Parliament, I was debating the Rabie \nCommission and the framework, the launching pad was still the highest law of \nthe land, is the security of the land. Now amongst that framework, amongst \nthat frame of mind we had put legislation on the statute book. Numbers of \nthem. Security legislation, the Terrorism Act, within them were embodied, \nsections, clauses which allowed policemen to question, to hold indefinitely \npeople in detention.

In other words what you did not have to know did not concern you. Let \nme give you a simple example, for the better, for the better, I was interviewed \nrecently by a gentleman called Jonathan Malanski, he is busy with his \ndoctorate at the London School of Economics, he is busy with research in this \ncountry at this particular juncture. He questioned me about a resolution taken \nat the State Security Council dealing with the release of Mr Nelson Mandela. I \nbelieve it was taken in June 1988 and it is minuted as follows that a document \nwas circulated and the document was then drawn in or drawn back and was \nthen destroyed and he asked me what had happened there, because directly or \nindirectly my name appears in and around that document.  \n The fact of the matter is the following That the ..(inaudible) \nWerkgroup the executive of the working group was charged to work a strategy, \nto establish a strategy to try and facilitate the release of President Nelson \nMandela. Now in that discussion it was clear that everybody was not pulling, \npushing all the information that they had, it was clear in my mind that Mr \nKobie Coetzee, Dr Neil Barnard, Mr Fanie van der Merwe were engaged in \ntheir own strategy over and above what we were busy with, that was none of \nmy business. \n Dr Neil Barnard was not obliged to report to me neither was Mr Fanie \nvan der Merwe, neither was Mr Kobie Coetzee. It was none of my business, I \ndid not want to know they were reporting to Mr P W Botha on that issue and \nthat was how it functioned. My job was to manage the state of emergency and \nall the information I had to have to manage the state of emergency I was \nentitled to and over and above that I was not entitled to that. I operated as a \nDeputy Minister and function under regulated or (help my met die - Engels \nman) regulations, delegated powers and regulations, over and above that it was \nnot my line function. I was not in the authority to detain people or to release \npeople, and in that sense I didn't know and I did not want to know, because I \nwas charged to do something else, to manage the state of emergency and the \nnational management system and I did that.

I don't want to get into a semantic \ndebate about it. \n The Security forces fought a war in the country and in certain respects \nthey fought a dirty war and that is evident from a number of the amnesty \napplications, the benefit of having fought that war including the dirty aspects \nwas that the revolution as envisaged did not occur, the revolutionaries did not \nwrest power from the National Party government as it was.

I sat in discussions where I was \ndefending, so to speak, people who were allies of the government, I am \nreferring to councillors, and no, I am not arguing the legitimacy, the non-\nlegitimacy of the fact, they were councillors and what had been done to them \nand I had listened to arguments where they had told me in the presence of \nothers what they thought of our policies. None of them were supporters of \napartheid, and yet they were subjected to but fierce intimidation. Serious \nintimidation. And I sat alongside South African policemen being accused by \nthem for not protecting them.  So that was the predicament, that was the \ncleftstick, John Citizen found himself in. \n I have somebody who has just been decorated for reporting on the work \nof this Commission and somebody I hold in high esteem who had first \neducated me about this predicament, John Citizen being called upon to not \ndisclose the whereabouts of an infiltrator, a revolutionary, being forced to \nremain silent by those people who wanted him to play a specific role, and yet \non the same side also being the subject of attacks by the security forces for \nnot disclosing that particular event, that was the difficulty.\n But let me not run away from the issue, the issue is the following, the \nChappies Klopper whom I happen to know, Chappies Klopper told me who he, \nwhy and how he and others had attacked the house of Ivor Jenkins, and I said, \nwhy did you do that, and I speak very good Afrikaans, just like Markgraaf, I \nhave a very good repertoire of Afrikaans words to explain my anger, I was \nreally the hell in, and I asked him, why did you do that?  And he said well we \ndid it because we thought they were giving you a hard time, not me \npersonally, the government.  How and why did he believe that?  Because we \nhad been making those speeches, the speeches Mr Pik Botha had referred to \nyesterday, National Party rallies. If you wanted to have an applause from the \ngathering, then you must see how we try and mobilise people and how we stir \nthem up at meetings, we will really speak to them and get them to react, we \nwill climb every mountain in this country.....used by us and the Chappies \nKloppers' of the world interpreted what we were saying, he thought it was \njust, it was legitimate to instil the fear of hell into Ivor Jenkins and others by \nattacking his house and shooting his house and never ever did I or anybody \ngive such, never did I, let me speak for myself, did I give such an instruction, \nnever ever, and that is what I said, can I condone that, but I cannot shy away \nfrom the fact, that those men and woman and I were on the same side and that \nwas the difficulty we're in. \n That is why I am not sure, I mean we run glibly over this, I am not sure \nwhether the people of South Africa and I say this with respect, the \nCommissioners and others appreciate that silent feeling of relief when the \nepilogue was agreed to. There are people who are picking it up, but that \nepilogue was not agreed to at the World Trade Centre in November of 1993, \nbut it, we had to go the extra mile, we had to go to the Cape of Good Hope \nCentre in December of 1993 to Cape Town, that is how difficult it was to get \nthat in, that is why I said I will be continuing tomorrow, I have a lot to say Mr \nChairman - now I am not biased against this Commission, I think my conduct, \nmy interaction with you displays that, but I implore you, don't squander the \nopportunity that we negotiated for you, in the epilogue, to ensure that this \nCounty will be at peace with itself after you have done your job.",

I think we have gone beyond that.  We are still \ngoing to have to try and establish, I mean we have got researchers and these \npeople who are going to be trying to establish facts and we are still going to \nhave our meeting with Mr P W Botha.  You indicated earlier that you believed \nthat it was important that your leaders should have been here to help you to \nbecome a team.\n But I think that anyone listening to yourselves is not going to go away \nwith, well, they were fussing over this, they were fussing over that, it is that \nyou have come out and stood, well almost naked, figuratively, and it is a very \nhumbling thing, it is a very humbling thing for us in the Commission, it is \nvery humbling, because some of the things that have happened in the two \nyears that we have been together, have been quite extraordinary, and we \nregard what has happened in these two days in different ways, but especially \nthe remarkable candour that you have displayed is something that I think \ndoesn't happen, it's not happened anywhere else.   I said when we sit here \nsometimes we forget, I mean, that you were the government, you were running \nthe show and now you are coming to give account to us who many of us were \nregarded in that dispensation as really nothing or worse, I mean, enemies to be \nneutralised.  And I just want to give thanks, I want to give thanks for our \ncountry, for our people, I want to give thanks that you two young men should \nhave, I mean, the honesty that you have demonstrated is, it doesn't come \neasily to anyone of us, I think and it must be at some cost to yourselves, but \nwe want to give thanks and believe, I mean we believe fervently that the \ncontribution that you have made in the past, but the contribution that you have \nmade today is going to be one that has a remarkable impact. \n It is going to help give a momentum to this process of seeking to heal \nour country, because we have been committed to the fact that we want to \nfinish this thing quickly. The country can't keep sitting and sort of scratching \nopen the wounds, that's had to be done, but it is a phase that must pass so that \nwe can actually get down to the business of holding hands and saying I want \nto make this country a great country.  \n The pain sometimes is that this could have happened so much earlier, \nyou know, but then, there is a wonderful little piece in the Bible which says, \n\"In the fullness of time, something happens in the fullness of time\" we might \nbe impatient and say \"why didn't it happen at that time? But the circumstances \nwere not ripe for it to happen. And I just hope you are aware that you have \nhelped, I think, to pour balm on the wounds of very many by what you two and \nto some extent the other two people have done, and I want to say thank you.\n  I want to thank my colleagues and our team over there and yourselves \nover there and all of you that, now I understand a little bit actually why the \nworld looks on and marvels that you can sit there and that I can laugh with \nyou when you can laugh with me, as they say, but it can't be, and it is, it is \nhappening and the miracle that they spoke of in 1994, I think God wants it to \npersist in part for the sake of the world, because if we can do it here with \nGod's help and God's blessing and the prayers of so many around the world \nand there is hope for Rwanda, Sierra Leone and all of those places. I want to \npray.\n God you are good and you do some extraordinary things in this Land.  \nWe thank you for the privilege of being fellow-workers with you. We thank \nyou for those who have come forward yesterday and today and for the things \nthat have happened and we pray that these and others similar to this will \ncontribute to the healing of this traumatised of this wounded people, thank \nyou God.
