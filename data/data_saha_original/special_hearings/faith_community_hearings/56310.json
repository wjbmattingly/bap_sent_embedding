            "We welcome representatives of the different Faith Communities. We welcome representatives   of the different Christian Denominations present here. We welcome representatives   from Councils of Churches. First I want to express on our behalf our very, very   heartfelt thanks to Pastor Chris Venter and his people who have made available   to us this splendid facility. We were able to hold a service here last night,   a splendid service, and we have the use of these facilities, I think it is at   no cost. Having said that it is at no cost, I doubt they will charge us! We   do want to say a very, very big thank you. But I also want to say thank you   to all of you coming from the different Faith Communities who have made submissions   to the Commission, and especially a big thank you to those of you who have subsequently   accepted the invitation to expand you written submissions with a verbal intervention.   In many ways we ought to be able to say this is a gathering that is probably   the most representative of the different Faith Communities of this land. God   has blessed us wonderfully and we should be those who give thanks to the Divine,   the Transcendent, who has led us to here. With regard to the Christian Community,   this could be said to be perhaps the most representative gathering since the   Rustenberg Conference, and possibly have a wider representation of the extraordinary   religious Christian Community in this land. May I also express my appreciation   as the Chairperson of this Commission, to my colleagues, fellow commissioners   and committee members, but especially those who were charged with the responsibility   of arranging this particular hearing? Dr Mgojo, Bongani Finca, Mcebisi Xundu   and Piet Meiring. I don't know, I mean they didn't seem to have gender sensitivity   here. They are all men! The women will have to say that if anything goes wrong,   it is clear the influence of women was not there!\nBut I would like to ask you to give a warm clap to the Centre for their generosity   and to all of you for coming and to this Committee for arranging this hearing.   Please just give them a clap. \nAPPLAUSE.\nIt is almost trite to say that this country is possibly the most religious   country, it certainly is a very religious country. Let me not be engaged in   comparisons. Now that doesn't say a great deal because religion is not necessarily   a good thing, not necessarily a bad thing. It can be a good or bad thing. It   was, after all, German Christians who supported Hitler, but then it was also   Christians in the confessing church who showed that wonderful resistance to   the awfulness of Nazism. And we know that in this country we marched against   the awfulness of Apartheid as members of the different faith communities Jews,   Muslims, Christians, Hindu and we were marching against a system that was buttressed   by others who claimed to be Christian as well.\nAnd so we have a peculiar responsibility as members of religious communities,   for we have, I think still a great deal of influence if we wished to exercise   it. I hope that it will be clear to the world that this particular hearing has   a different quality to it from all the other hearings we have heard so far.   That splendid son of the soil, as they say, a great Christian leader, Archbishop   Hurley had a lovely story that he tells of three Archbishops standing in front   of the altar and they are all beating their breasts and saying, \"Lord,   I'm not worthy, Lord I'm not worthy\". Then the church cleaner comes along   and stands next to them and he also beats his breast and says, \"Lord I'm   not worthy, Lord I'm not worthy\". Then one of the Archbishops nudges his   friend and says; \"Just look who thinks he's not worthy\". \nBut I hope that the story of the Pharacies and the Publican will have informed   the submissions and will inform our gathering. You know that in the theology   of sacramental confession, you are meant to accuse yourself. You are meant to   confess your sins, not the sins of another. You are meant not to justify yourself.   A self-calpatory exercise is a futility. You are meant to say what went wrong   with yourself and then other people may then say, \"Actually, he was not   so bad. She was not so bad\". Because if you say it of yourself, then there   is no need for others to try and be nice to you. We are here, not in order to   ridicule anyone, we are here to say to God and the world, we have fallen short   of your glory. You have used us as we are and there are some wonderful things   that you enabled us to do. There is no church that I know of that will not have   something to confess of its shortcomings, and very few that might not have some   good things to say. The church to which I belong could never be triumphalistic,   could never come here and gloat because the church to which I belong and which   I love so very deeply, as just a small example, for a very, very long time,   paid different stipends determined by race. It was only very recently that we   had an equalisation of stipends. So Anglicans can't come and appear to be \"beter   koffie\". And I'm sure that they are not going to try and do that. But it   will be important for us to say where we fell short, what we did do that was   good because of the grace of this incredible compassionate God. But much, much   more important, what are we going to do for the healing of this land? That is   going to be the major challenge. What are we going to do to carry out the ministry   of reconciliation that has been entrusted to us? \n(Cellular phone rings). It's mine. My apologies. I have this awful thing. If   you have this awful thing, switch it off. Thank you very much. What are we going   to be doing? We are meant to be able to encourage those with the burden of guilt.   Jettison that guilt. Confess. Because God is a faithful God and will forgive   us our sins. And to say to those who have been victims of it all, \"Be willing   to forgive\". And we in the churches and religious communities have a wonderful   opportunity of counselling, of standing there besides the perpetrators and their   families, because they too are still children of God. To stand by those who   have been shut up, and it is we the religious community who are going to have   to do something about the moral fibre of our country. It is we who are going   to have to say to this country, even the most awful perpetrator, still remains   a child of God. And that perpetrator has the capacity to change. After all,   we Christians speak of a soul who becomes a pall. For all of us are beneficiaries   of the inestimable grace of God and ultimately we are going to be the instruments   of the grace of this compassionate God. And I'm sure we will tell people that   it is not enough just to confess it is not enough just to be forgiven. But there   is something called reparation. Restitution. And we are going to be the ones   who have to be persuading people to do something to show that you are in earnest   about what happened in the past. Thank you.\nThank you very much. General Secretary Hlope Bam please. I will ask - oh I'm   so sorry I have not introduced the panel.

            "Thank you very much. I would like to congratulate the planners through   you for putting me first to speak. I think this is a change of the tradition   of the church. But I would also like to remind the committee's planners that   we are told that the first human being was in Africa and originated from South   Africa, and it was a black woman that brought the whole humanity to its being,   so it's not surprising that I am the first person to speak. It would also like   to introduce the team, sir that is going to help me to do the presentation and   answer questions. On my left is Eddie MacKew, who is the director of our justice   ministries, and the next is Reverend Bernard Spong, who is our veteran in media   and communication and on the extreme left is Lulama Ntshingwa, who is our organising   secretary for this province, the Eastern Cape. I would like to say that I stand   in line of great leadership in this position I hold of outstanding people who   were the general secretaries of the South African Council of Churches before   me. In the name of Archbishop Bill Bernard, John Reece and you sir, Archbishop   Desmond Tutu, Dr Beyers Naude and the Reverend Frank Chikane. In fact, I had   hoped that all of you would be the ones doing this submission as you were part   of that history, and unfortunately because of the position you are now holding   as Chairman of this, you are not able to do so. But I would also like, with   your permission, to pay tribute to all the members of this panel. Without exception   today, all the people who are sitting on this panel have been part of the South   African Council of Churches, have made a contribution as individuals and have   made a contribution as members of their various organisations. I would like   to recognise them and say that the very reason they are members of this panel   is because they contributed to the work of the South African Council of Churches   and to the ecumenical movement in general. But to say, sir, as well, there are   people in this audience, many people who I cannot mention by name and I will   be speaking on their behalf, because the Council of Churches consists of twenty   three members churches, of which three are observer members, and all of them   are represented here. And so we are part of that tradition. There are many courageous   people, sir, who have contributed to this. I cannot mention all of them, but   our submission gives you the detailed names of these people. But I want to mention   by name people like Reverend Calatha, Reverend Gawa, who were in this province   in the early days whereas people of the church and as church leaders took the   leadership of the African National Congress and people like Huddleston, Breytenbach,   Desmond and many more others. I would like us to remember today, as we make   this submission, our colleagues and I am sure that they will be mentioned by   Bishop Michael or Victor Africanda, S. Sothetsi and Delisa Matshoba ...[inaudible].\nThank you very much sir. The SACC has been in operation for twenty seven years,   but it is important for us to note that even before 1968, when it was founded,   there were some activities that had taken place, and some statements that the   churches had made and I think that we have indicated that in our submission   and we have made reference to those specific things that have been done. I want   to mention just a few, and one of them being the important ecumenical conference   of ...[inaudible].",

            "I had started to say that prior to 1968 before we were founded as   SACC, there were some important events, and I will simply refer to them without   going into detail, because they are very important and part of our history.   In 1949, at ecumenical conference at which Chief Albert Luthuli spoke and at   which a call was made to a franchise vote. This was a church conference. A very   important statement of 1957 by the United Church, which stood against the proposed   policy to curtail inter-racial worship. The good thing was that the clause was   never enacted. Then of course, the history of the [ ] conference of 1960 which   was not a conference called by the SACC. It was called by the World Council   of Churches and it is important that at that time the Dutch Reformed Church   had already pulled out of the Council of Churches as early as 1940. And of course   there is the history of the formation of the Christian Institute of which we   were part of the organisation that gave inspiration to that. We were not responsible   to it. \nThere have been some wonderful words of wisdom and the prophetic role remained   very important to the SACC. One of the interesting facts in the development   is that in fact blacks became very involved and very articulate after 1972.   After the Government had decided that the SACC would be a black organisation.   I think this was something that was not necessarily bad because prior to that   the organisation had been led by white males which is the tradition of the church   in this country. And so that enforcement of the government to make to make it   a black organisation and recognise, by accident, the black leadership. This   made it important because it was the blacks who themselves were part of the   community which was suffering and the community that was in pain. There are   very important in our history prophetic ecumenical statements that were made   and I would like to just quote one of them. There are many, but I could not   quote all of them. This one was made by Desmond when he was general secretary   between the years of 1978 and 1984. I quote what he said to the Minister of   Law and Order of that time \"We must remind you that you are not God. You   are just a man, and one day your name shall merely be a faint scribble on the   pages of history. While the name of Jesus Christ the Lord of the church shall   live forever.\" \nI want to say that it is statements of that nature, of people of courage, who   made this movement to be as involved as it remained, because of the burner or   hope, where people never lost hope that one day there would be a change in our   country. The SACC were able, they were never stopped from teaching, they were   never stopped from writing resolutions. They were never stopped from meeting   and having their annual conferences. And so their prophecy had a space, in spite   of the repression that took place. In 1968 there was indeed a small beginning   when a statement was sent out to the world and there were very positive responses.   The rest of the world responded very positively. They were encouraged, less   perhaps than that response at home. There were all kinds of confusing reactions   from some of the South African churches at the time. But a very important project   was launched in 1972 to start a project on Christianity in an apartheid society.   I am delighted to see in the audience one of the persons who was part of that   experience, Reverend[ ] I see you sitting over there. And a resolution on the   Conscientious Objectors, this was a statement that came from the 1974 annual   conference that was held by the SACC, and there was the wonderful idea of what   they called non co-operation in the 1975. Now these, sir, might seem to be statements   that were not as progressive or radical, but considering the context of that   day and the repression and surveillance of the church, these were very, very   important statements.\nThen the declaration of Apartheid as a hierarchy, which was not a statement   of the SACC. It was a statement of the World Alliance Reformed Churches in 1982.   But this was very much the thinking as well as a concept that was shared by   the SACC. Then there was a call to prayer at the end for the unjust rule in   1985. There was a very important statement in 1997 that came after the Lusaka   Conference when many of our leaders were called to discuss with leaders from   all over the world through the World Council of Churches. Then there was the   controversial debate which almost really divided the churches, not only here,   but also the churches abroad though they remained controversial until the very   end of Apartheid. The statement by the ICT, in 1989, which also encouraged many   people in the SACC to continue to work the road to Damascus. I do not remember   at any time a document that was so important, not only for the churches in South   Africa, but for many churches abroad, who took that document and felt that it   did not only speak for our situation, but it also addressed many issues of the   world, and many warnings that came through the church.\nThe SACC, as you know, was involved in many activities, and I will simply go   through the list of these activities without discussing them in detail, as it   will take a long time. I think one of the most important areas of work was in   the area of justice issues. We had a division called the Justice and Reconciliation,   and were concerned that the SACC and its member churches were on the removals.   I hope that the same concern would be now with the churches on the whole question   of regaining land, which those people lost. The caring discipleship, the famous   work of what was known as the Dependant's Conference and the thinking that went   with that kind of work with people like Archbishop Ramse, who were part of that   work. The legal department of the SACC, as you know did a lot of work and handled   many cases, and worked with many lawyers. One of the biggest cases handled was   the Delmas trial and I am glad to see that one of the panellists today was part   of that experience. We also had a very important programme in the SACC, the   Sanctuary Programme, where many young South Africans, were protected from the   wrath of the police. Then we have the inter church aid work of the money that   was going to community projects before people talked as much as they do these   days about development. Already the money was made available to grassroots communities.   The African Bursary fund, which functioned for exactly 26 years and thousands   of South Africans, got an opportunity to go to school through that programme.   The faith and mission remained a very important part of our work, because it   was possible for us to do research work. There were other programmes, as you   know that were important at the time. The home and family life programme, the   youth programme, the women's day. I'm not going to say anything more on that.   And then we had the Visitor's programme, which was important as we had to keep   in touch on a regular basis with many people visiting South Africa at the time   and they were not always in a position to relate to Government, so we were able   to work with them. Then we had a problem of refugees, which we still do to this   day because we have many people who are coming into the country who are not   necessarily qualifying as refugees, and we refer to them as people who have   been uprooted from their countries. Many more other activities we did on the   Detainees Parents Committee. We were part of that and we were also part of the   National Committee for repatriation of many South Africans who were returning   to the country. In the late 90's we were also part or a group called AMSA helping   the church and community to monitor elections and try and prevent violence.\nPrayer and worship became an important feature because it was the only way   in which people could share their pain, to pray with one another and it was   through this programme that they were able to sustain the work they were doing   spiritually. The programme to combat racism of the World Council of Churches   was not our programme, but we got a lot of inspiration and support through that   programme because many churches around the world could be informed of what was   going on through us. There were many protests that the churches organised, all   around the country. It was also a great boost that Archbishop Desmond Tutu as   a general secretary in 1984 received the Nobel Prize. The change now occurred   in the late 80's because the churches continued to negotiate with the government.   Many meetings were set up with the government, but also the churches at that   point became confrontational. They had to use that method because the response   was very poor from the government. You might recall the famous history, which   many of you in this room were part of, when you all went to parliament in February   1988, and it was the most important move that the churches of South Africa ever   took. That was then followed by the \"standing for the truth\" campaign,   where again many of you in this room participated. At that time the movement   had changed and there were many other interventions and I do want to remind   many people in South Africa that the Peace Accord in fact, the midwife to the   Peace Accord, was the SACC and its leaders. Finally then that programme then   was taken over by the government and other agencies. Then we went through very   difficult times during that time, as you are aware, as there were many difficulties   that the country was facing. There was already a very hostile reaction from   the government after the 1968 statement. The Eloff Commission was probably one   of the hardest things that the SACC had to go through. It was good that the   SACC had to go through this as it showed a response, which was positive and   overwhelming for many of our donor partners. There were police raids, no only   in Khotso House, but in homes of many of our staff members, our supporters,   many of our church leaders. Constantly people were being detained, tortured,   and as I mentioned earlier, some of the people died. Of course, the media was   constantly being that they couldn't report all the things that they wanted to   report. Bernard will say more on that. Then the bombing of Khotso House, which   you know has been publicly owned by those who bombed Khotso House, with a hope   that the work we were doing would come to an end and the poisoning of General   Secretary Frank Chikane and by God's grace, Frank Chikane lived. It think this   is a great story of God's power, because when he was poisoned and everything   had been tried, we were informed by the doctors in the United States that Dr   Frank Chikane would not live, because they had been unable to really diagnose   him. At that point, we were lucky that Bishop Tutu was able to get some of the   Bishops from the United States and the Anglicans to go to Frank, and he received   his last rights from the Anglicans. I think this is quite an ecumenical experience   for him, and I think that's why Frank lived. Needless to report, we had difficulties   to get Archbishop Tutu from his retreat, to ask him to do the job. There was   an interesting thing that they did once. St Barnabus College, some of you might   recall that the police had an idea of spraying a chemical so that those people   who were coming to the National Conference would all be affected by that chemical.   I don't know how many people in this room remember that. What I do remember,   in spite of that chemical, is that Buti Thlagale had to preach that night, and   he survived the chemical, as many of us did.\nThere are many things that we did, sir, it is a long history, which we hope   to write. I want to go on some of the things that were important and the kind   of impact that I think [SIDE 2] country where many, many of our staff persons,   many clergy, many lay people went and were very close with the families, and   were counselling these families and giving them all kinds of support. But there   was also the constant challenge which was important, that the churches of South   Africa all the time had to reflect and to retreat, and really begin to coin   a kind of theology that was emerging from the kind of work they were doing.   The greatest challenge and weakness perhaps of the SACC was the SACC tended   to be always reacting to the government, rather than being proactive. There   wasn't the time and the space for people to sit and plan the strategy very,   very careful because there was a lot that was going on. The second weakness   is that the SACC tended to act on its own, as SACC because some of the churches,   though at times supported statements that were made, they did not always support   the strategy and the action. It was not possible for the SACC to pull the churches   with them on every action and all the time. So there was a conflict always in   the family, not always in agreement with the actions that were taken. Very little   patience was there on trying to persuade other churches to take part and the   feeling is that if only, if only the time had been taken to persuade more churches   in South Africa to really be in the struggle maybe we would have shortened the   duration of this long, long time of repression in this country.",

That there can never be reconciliation in our country   as long as those who have are not prepared to share with those who have nothing.   And I think that this is a challenge to us as a church.

            "Thank you for the opportunity, sir. Obviously I just want   to talk a little about communication, which was one of the strengths and one   of the great weaknesses of course, of the Council of Churches. There was the   whole disinformation and misinformation campaign that went on by the government.   There's the way in which that forced the SACC to become an information centre   in itself, in the establishment of the press agency. Trying to tell the world   what was happening. And it may be that one of the things that happened with   the Council of Churches was that we gave so much information to the rest of   the world that somehow or other there were people in the country who were not   knowing what the Council was about. Okay, we had many things that obstructed   this information. We had the obstruction of course of the fact that the mass   media was not open to the churches, the Council of Churches' churches. We had   the opposition in some ways, in some of the churches, so that the messages couldn't   get down to grass roots, and what eventually happened was that the communication   network became a communication network more of individuals in many ways. Sir,   I don't know, I mean I look at this row of people and think how strange it is   to be talking about the SACC, but I wonder whether you would agree with my assessment,   but in many ways there was a contradiction in the name and activities. That   the Council of Churches was a Council of Churches as one level in that the leaders   and representatives of the churches made the decisions, but in fact the action   was by individuals from those churches who were actually committed to the cause   and the struggle against apartheid and were prepared to make that stand.\nThat network of communication that stretched overseas brought us many, many   partners. People that we would want to publicly to express gratitude to, as   I know you would, sir. The people who supported us at the Eloff Commission.   The people who would support us by their postcards and their odd words that   would flood into Khotso House at various times. It was that network, it was   a national network of communication, and finally, sir, one of the things that   I would like to say, because I believe that this relates to the future of the   work of the communication of the Council and the churches. Because the churches   have a network which reaches into every corner of this country, the churches   have been able through the years to know the vibe of the country; where people   are, and been able to speak this out. And let us hope to God that the present   government is going to have ears to hear, in a way that the past one didn't.   I think of two instances, sir, I think of your own letter in 1976 to the then   Prime Minister, about the situation in Soweto and how many lives could have   been saved. What could have happened in our country if only there had been ears   to hear, and eyes to see at that time? And the other one is of course the Bisho   massacre. Reverend Finca was very much involved with Frank Chikane in pleading   with those who were concerned, saying \"we know what the situation is, we   know what can happen\" and then had to see that bloody carnage that happened   at that time. The churches are in touch. The churches need to realise that they   are in touch and need to realise the responsibility of being in touch, to put   that message to the authorities and to the people of the land.

It was very clear during the   time of the struggle that there was the SACC on the other side, fighting for   the liberation of the people. We had the government on the other side, fighting   the retention of apartheid. Now we have moved into a new era with the people   who have been our partners. We know that the SACC has been partners with the   liberation movements and the government we have now is made up of those people   who were partners when we were fighting for the freedom of this country.

            "Yes. We coined a phrase, which is not acceptable to a number of   people. We call it critical solidarity. In fact that phrase came from discussions   we have had precisely on discussing how we are going to relate to the present   government. The problem we have is that we are coming from a tradition of protest   and we have understood ourselves to be the people who are watching the government.   The method we are using is not always the method that the country appreciates.   We used in the old days the press as the major channel for us to register our   protest. Now we are using the channel of negotiation with this government. We   realise that if we talk to them through the press, then there is no dialogue.   Everybody builds a defence. And so our method is that we negotiate with the   government and we discuss with the government some of the things, which we feel   the government is not doing correctly. But there is also a lack of ecumenical   position on the part of the churches. A number of churches seem to prefer to   dialogue as denominations with this government, and wanting their denomination   to be the one that the government recognises and works with and that is weakening   our position. And so we don't have an ecumenical position, and an example of   that is over this whole question of the land. We don't have an ecumenical position.   To say to the government we are not in agreement on the whole question of compensation.   How do we involve the communities in South Africa on the issues of benefits?   In some ways the SACC's position is not as clear because of our membership.   We are much more diverse now in our outlook on issues, whereas apartheid was   easier, because the beast was there and the beast you could see. But now, as   churches, we have different positions. For instance we couldn't address the   government ecumenically on the issue of abortion. On issues of homosexuals,   and those are some of the issues that are very important to some of the churches,   and not to others. There are those who feel that we have to address the government   more on issues of poverty, and issues of correctional services. So in other   words, our position as the SACC is not as clear as it was, but critical solidarity   remains the main concept that we affirm.",

That is a clear indication that therefore we need to come home   and appeal to our member churches. Mr Chairman, as you know, the churches themselves   in this country are struggling to survive as denominations. We think that that   is going to be a problem. However, we are beginning, as the SACC, to engage   the churches to come up with priority programmes. Programmes that will impact   on the lives of people and that is a process, but that process is in place.   We are engaging the nation in what is called programme audit, so that at the   end of the day we take those programmes that will be effective to the congregations.   We will need to acknowledge the fact that even local funders as well as foreign   funders are most keen to fund the government, so in that case then the government   becomes the main funder. And at this point, as you have heard, we are having   what we call, you know this kind of solidarity, critical solidarity, with the   state. We think that we will need to begin not only with the member churches,   but also with the local government, with the local private sector and with the   local agencies that can afford to give money to the church.

There are plans,   which may be heard in other ways during the time of this hearing about ecumenical   newspapers, about new ways of being able to touch the whole church. And one   of the reasons for this kind of thinking is the way in which there are so many   language, 11 languages, recognised. The cost for printing, the time for translating,   all of this means that in the kind of crisis that you've heard of costs, the   SACC finds itself unable to say that it can publish its material in all of these   languages. But at the same time, let's say that one of the publications of the   SACC recently on the reconciliation services, the ideas of the liturgy for those   services that bring people together, to be able to look at reconciliation and   symbols of reconciliation. Those services have been printed in the different   languages and made available to the people. But no, what we have to do possibly   much more in the whole religious constituency, is be able to get into the new   forms of information giving, which are the community broadcasting, and be able   to go into those places, so that the voice of the church, the voice of religious   communities is not heard in a foreign language within the narrow confines of   that which is called religious. But in fact it is the voice of the religious   community speaking in the areas and arenas, in the arenas of the public, and   it is in that way sir, as the church begins to train its people to be able to   broadcast, to be able to speak, to be able to write in these ways, so that we   don't just confine ourselves to that religious message, but a religious message   that is a reflection upon what is happening in the different communities.

My observation   is that the SACC was not only under attack from the government, the apartheid   government, but the most painful attack was that attack which came from churches   in South Africa. Churches who opted to be outside the structure of the structure   of the Council of Churches. And I think that that attack opened very deep wounds   in the church itself in this country.

How is it hoping to   do that without going through a process of not just papering over those wounds?

Because the truth of the matter is   that we cannot give the answer that should ideally be given by the church, where   we recognise that yes, we have not dealt adequately with reconciliation in the   church. During the short period of the life of the Truth and Reconciliation   Commission, we have tried to involve more churches in programmes on reconciliation   in South Africa and have become, through that process, painfully aware of the   lack of preparedness. The lack of will, amongst so many of us, professing Christians   in this country to deal honestly and sincerely with reconciliation. We are,   however, not giving up hope, we are not despairing. We would want to tie that   with a broader development that is happening, where at the All Africa Conference   of Churches, the theme was \"troubled but not destroyed\". We are troubled   by the lack of willingness, but we don't despair. We believe that the opportunities   are still there for us. We are still alive, we are still under God's grace and   it is possible that we could do something. In very small endeavours, we are   beginning to confront that challenge in particular communities. It is at this   time not really something worth mentioning, but we believe it is with those   very small lights shining through, that eventually we will be able to overcome   the darkness.

The approach is that this particular programme should be   owned by the churches and this is important.

So that is an important strategy. The second one is that   because of that approach, the plans of the work and what we do, we get together   with the member churches, who are already in their own small communities working   on poverty, so that we work from the grassroots to the commission itself. So   it's a new approach, a little slower than the ones we have tried to do. We are   trying to do it in a way that it would be possible for the poor people of South   Africa to participate and they can only do that if the programme itself comes   from the level of congregation, rather than for us to design plans of combating   poverty on a national level. We realise that is a weak approach. The second   approach is that we want to work with the government on this. So we are in conversations   with some of the MEC's of the provinces, so that we can have joint projects   and programmes on the provincial level as well as on the local level. So our   strategies are several fold and of course the third strategy is one of dealing   with economic justice, because we realise that we can't isolate poverty from   the structures, economic and political structures.

This is a very,   very difficult area and we have not been able as the SACC, I have to say it,   to design a project, or design a programme of dealing with it, because it has   to go back to families and communities.

            "Thank you very much. May I just take issue with yourselves for   accepting Joyce's premise that the SACC previously didn't address the spiritual   needs. What do you mean? I want to differ very strongly! Because the needs,   I mean you would not be incarnational if you said we were not dealing with the   spiritual needs of the people, but that is not the point I wanted to make. Just   maybe two points before you step down. It may be possible in dealing with the   question of the reconciliation between the churches, which Bongani was talking   about. It may be possible to handle that by our own readiness to confess our   weakness. I was speaking about how we in the SACC were often harsh in our condemnation   of the white Dutch Reformed Church. Remember we used to say to them \"Why   don't you address the government on this or that issue?\" And they said   \"No, we have addressed them, but agter geslote deure!\" Now it struck   me on one occasion, this is not name dropping and so on, that I was sitting   very early on after Madiba became President, I was sitting with him at a meal   and I was telling him some of the things that were bugging us already. And I   stood outside of myself and said, \"You see, Tutu, you are doing exactly   the sort of thing that you were criticising the other people for!\" Because   it isn't easy, and you've got to accept it, it isn't easy to criticise people   you like and people with whom you have been working in the struggle. And I think   we should acknowledge that we were often arrogant in the way in which we spoke.   It may be too, that we have to acknowledge that we were somewhat self-righteous.   I mean our cause was right! But in a way, sometimes we came across; we should   say and acknowledge that we might not have made things easy for other people.   And in our readiness to be self-critical, we might get other people willing   also to acknowledge that there were things that they might have done differently.   The last point I want to make is that I am glad I am a retired Archbishop now,   because it was easy in many ways to know what was church. You know, when you   were in the against mode, it was easy. And as you say, we were able to be united   and we had no doubt about our identity. Now, we are at a loss, and God said   okay I would like you to leave it to younger people like Mgojo and others let   them now deal with what is a critical issue. What does it mean to be church   in South Africa today? And this crisis of identity is one that churches are   going to be needing help with and maybe one of your major concerns as the SACC.   But thank you very, very much and since you are stepping down as General Secretary   may we acknowledge you and give you just a special clap. Let's give her a clap!   APPLAUSE.\nWe are calling on - Bernard Spong you look like - no you are not there. Wesley   Mabuza and David Musomo, to speak up to about 10 'o clock. So the Institute   for Contextual Theology and Theology of Liberation. \nOne of the wonderful things about this audience, this congregation, is that   they are behaving very much like an Anglican congregation. They all want to   sit at the back! It might be a help if you came to the front so that people   who come late don't have a problem and they can just slip in. I notice that   there are Roman Catholics who are also sitting at the back! Can you please very   kindly? Thank you very much. Welcome both of you gentlemen.

            "Sir, we made a brief presentation but we have a much more   comprehensive one which will be something that we think will be a contribution   to this TRC process. With your permission I would like to proceed. I thank you   Chairperson for inviting the Institute for Contextual Theology (ICT) to address   this gathering. Firstly, the ICT feels privileged to congratulate the TRC in   its achievements in the last two years. A number of acts against humanity have   been uncovered within a short space of time. A normal course of justice would   have been evaded by the perpetrators of the atrocities. Credit is also due in   large part to the TRC method of investigation for all that has been uncovered.   Families are now beginning to start a new life with the knowledge that those   who killed their loved ones have at last admitted it and in most cases showed   where they had buried them, painful as this discovery will always be. \nToday marks the beginning of a very important chapter in the truth and reconciliation   process, when religious bodies which possess the power to influence the hearts   and minds of the majority are called upon to account on how they have used or   abused that privilege. Religious bodies, Chairperson, hold considerable sway   in society, but they themselves are susceptible to all kinds of influences which   at times lead them to commit abuses intentionally or unintentionally. This moment,   Chairperson, is also significant because for the first time in the history of   our country, religious communities are called upon to give accounts of their   understanding of their mission in the context of apartheid and how they hope   to do mission in the future. Standing behind blanket statements made by the   SACC on behalf the churches during apartheid has not helped us to understand   the theological positions of some churches which we saw in practice contradicting   the mission of the SACC (I think this has already been mentioned). Incidentally,   it was this factor, among others, that led to the formation of ICT, and this   leads me to the next point What is the Institute for Contextual Theology? The   struggle in this country was for justice that would lead to liberation, restoration   and reconciliation. The church, however, did not have an appropriate theology   to underwrite that struggle. As a response to this reticence or inability to   act appropriately, ICT came into being in 1981. ICT fashioned itself according   to the prophetic tradition and unapologetically advocated the theology of liberation,   determined by the dynamics of the Southern African context. ICT counts itself   among those working towards the establishment of God's reign on earth. The first   general secretary of ICT was the Reverend Dr. Elliat Ngema, who was then followed   by the Reverend Dr. Frank Chikane, who is now in the Deputy President's office.   Dr Chikane was succeeded by the Reverend Dr. Mangaliso Mkhatshwa, who is now   Deputy Minister of Education. ICT wishes to pay tribute to these leaders, who   made highly significant contributions to Contextual Theology and to the liberation   of this country.",

            "To fetch some water, Sir. [PAUSE].\nThank you Chairperson, I was beginning to be too serious, actually. As the   present General Secretary of ICT, I feel very humble before my predecessors.   Whatever I do, albeit in different circumstances, is in continuity with the   trend set by my predecessors. ICT operates outside the status quo of both church   and state, although the ultimate aim is to serve the State which is wider than   the governing group of people and the church which is much more profound than   the institutional church. ICT nevertheless is proud to be an affiliate of the   SACC. Liberation theologists' biblical imperative is to be found in Isaiah Chapter   61, verse 1 - 4, and is quoted in Luke Chapter 4, verse 18-19, particularly   the words \"To set at liberty those who are oppressed. For this reason   a group of Theologians met together at that critical time of South Africa's   history, and using the process of wide and in-depth consultation, eventually   came up with what came to be known as the Carus Document, issued as a challenge   to the churches. In its short lifetime, the institute has suffered much at the   hands of the previous government and from rejection by most churches who have   misunderstood is vision and mission. Both government and the churches singled   out liberation theology as the devil's theology and thus accused ICT of serving   the interest of.[TAPE ENDS] [inaudible] have a lot in common between   communism, barring atheism and Christianity than the church would care to admit.   History nevertheless did vindicate the ICT. Some valuable contributions were   made by ICT in spite of all these hostilities. For example training of solid   leadership during the lean years of apartheid when there was no overt political   leadership; change to the theological paradigm in South Africa; publication   of the Carus Document in 1985, which accelerated the process, promoting a world-wide   theological reflection network. For example, the Road to Damascus was a production   of that nature, producing parliamentary candidates and church leaders who had   close associations with ICT, providing a forum of sharing of experiences and   knowledge amongst concerned pastors, theologians and Christians in general.   Throughout its existence, ICT has received overseas funding from organisations   and church individuals who aligned themselves with the ideals of the institute.   A small but significant contribution also comes from its membership, which is   world-wide. It is these contributions which have enabled ICT to maintain its   independent status. I now come to the essence of ICT as a prophetic movement.   ICT operates outside church and government structures in order that it could   provide an ongoing independent critique. For this reason, some people now label   ICT as the institute of critical theologians, while others label it as the organisation   of spoilers. Both labels have become unpopular these days, whereas in the not   so distant past, people gained popularity by being critical or by being regarded   as spoilers of the system. But had it not been for those critical theologians   or spoilers, little progress would have been made. Today the gradual disappearance   of those kinds of prophets of old is leaving a vacuum that is difficult to fill.   In its critique of the church, ICT stated that some churches in South Africa   were engaging in state theology, which meant that churches supported the apartheid   regime, based on Romans 13, while conveniently ignoring Revelations 13. May   I, with your permission, just debate briefly and coach what you just said, Chairperson,   about the fact that it becomes a hidden thing, when you talk about state theology.   It is a very closed door, behind closed doors, that happens which is not overtly   seen usually as state theology. And other churches resorted to church theology.   A very superficial critique of apartheid lacking in in-depth analysis of the   prevailing context, whilst stressing the need for reconciliation and peace,   at the expense of justice. ICT wanted reconciliation at the time but not at   the expense of the poor. The prophetic movement was intended to be in continuity   with these persecuted prophets of the past. Those who never took anything for   granted. Instead, they raised questions about the policies of both secular and   religious leaders that must have kept the nation lively and awake as a prophetic   movement does today. But questions are not raised for their own sake. Their   aim is to ensure a healthy public policy and just governance for all. Chairperson,   ICT is proud to say that throughout its existence in South Africa, it has done   just that. For that, it incurred the wrath of the previous government, or was   temporarily disowned by the church and regarded as a stepchild because it made   both religious and secular leaders uncomfortable. With the knowledge that the   resources of this county are enough to feed its people, it equitably distributed,   and that this was not the case as the apartheid government preserved them for   a few, we aligned ourselves as ICT publicly with the poor and oppressed. We   then challenged and approached on theological grounds anything that threatened   the well being of the poor and oppressed, while we looked for a way out of our   suffering. It is in this light that we published and campaigned against the   status quo. Also with the knowledge that apartheid since it was officially endorsed   by the then Orange Free State Synod of the DRC in 1935 and was implemented in   full swing by Dr Verwoerd in 1958, and that the non-DRC churches had not done   much to oppose it, we adopted the critical stands towards these churches.\nAt the time, we thought that the problem was the wrong abstract theology, which   they inherited from Europe, but now we realise that that theology was used as   a scape-goat in a situation where the reality was that the churches, especially   white members of these churches, had benefited a lot from apartheid. Regrettably,   one feels in hindsight, that when we talk of the problem of the churches during   apartheid, we are essentially talking about those who controlled them, our white   fellow Christians. We would like the commission to note that this aspect has   a lot of implications for restitution and reconstruction. If Christians had   raised their voice from the beginning and rejected all privileges, things would   have been different. Why ICT's reluctance to support the TRC? Chairperson, I   now come to the most delicate part of this presentation. When ITC first received   the invitation to participate in this hearing, we wrote back to Dr Piet Meiring,   stating ICT's reluctance to participate in the TRC process. This was not intended   as a publicity stunt, nor did it arise out of ignorance of what goes on, nor   was it motivated by attempts to encourage anarchy, nor a feeling of self-righteousness.   ICT's reluctance to lend unqualified support to the TRC process stems from a   deeper analysis and scepticism. Let me elaborate briefly 1. The question of   perpetrator and victim. We found the summons of both activists and upholders   of the system to account for their actions confusing. To us this meant equating   the perpetrator and the victim as if they are equally culpable. Although we   did not expect the TRC to pass judgement, we at least expected it to distinguish   between those who should give accounts of their deeds and those who should feel   free to comment on the situation. This, of course, did not only apply to the   ICT and the religious communities, but to our former liberation movements as   well. We felt that such an approach was trivialising the process. It has become   clear, Chairperson, during some searching's of the TRC, that for some perpetrators,   the TRC is a non-event, and therefore of no consequence. ICT's problem was the   message this would convey would be conveying concerning the prophetic movement.   We changed our mind out of respect for the constitution upon which we all agree,   and the very person sitting on this panel.\n2. A concern about the society beyond the TRC process. While a lot of hidden   activities have been uncovered by the TRC investigating units, ICT is concerned   that virtually all perpetrators of such gross violations are getting off with   impunity. To the extent that we are not calling for executions or life imprisonment.   We cannot be accused of expecting Nuremberg type of trials. Lack of a mechanism   that makes the perpetrators take responsibility for their actions is causing   some resentment to say the least. ICT's concern, Chairperson, is about what   happens beyond the TRC process. Are we all going to look back in the next five   years with sadness at the waste of money, human resources and valuable time?   If so, we wondered whether all these resources could not have been channelled   to other uses which could better build communities which had suffered for so   long from degradation and deprivation. It is clear that people on the ground   do not understand what the National Reconciliation Act is all about, since racism   and exploitation still abound. The bitterness caused by our gory past has not   yet subsided. All this cannot be ignored if our future is to be built on a sound   foundation. To date, Chairperson and members of the commission, we still have   not found an answer to our question. Our AGM this year, however, has mandated   ICT's steering committee to set up a task force, whose task would be to work   out guidelines for a society beyond the TRC process. \nTRC for the churches. We had also thought that churches needed their own TRC,   instead of being called to account at this process. Our problem is that the   present process arose out of a political settlement. As such, it is limited   by the terms of agreement in what it can do. Even the interpretation of the   terms so familiar to Christian theology, for example reconciliation, justice,   truth, reflect these limitations. Christians know very well what the meaning   of reconciliation is and what its implications are. They also know the biblical   understanding of justices and what their implications are. The present process   has not mentioned terms such as restitution or penance or God's role, which   relates to the terms it uses. It would not be proper for us, however, to expect   this of the present process. Rather, we though that Christians would talk amount   themselves and work out what they could do. The same could be expected of other   religious communities.\nLack of economic dimension We also felt that the present process was silent   about the economic dimension of reconciliation. We understand that there are   other processes taking place, as well as structures that deal with other issues,   but when we talk of national reconciliation, we expect a body with the stature   of the TRC to go beyond listening to killings and torture, to include the category   of those who benefited directly or indirectly economically. Chairperson, we   are thinking here of both black and white South Africans. We did not know at   the time that the category of business people would be added. Our focus was   not only on business people, but on everyone who had been enriched by apartheid   while others were dying in the bush and the townships, and police offices. We   felt that these were the people who should be compelled to plough back their   wealth towards reconstruction and reparation. In this regard, Chairperson, we   align ourselves with the recent view expressed by the Stellenbosch academic,   who made a submission to this commission that those who possess more than R2   million in cash and assets should be taxed for reconstruction. But we wish to   go further and reduce the R2 million to every R1 million, to increase the slice   of the cake. We also want to make a call to others who benefited in the same   way to make an extra contribution. These are the people who should be raising   the R3 billion needed for reparation. Chairperson, we do not think that this   is unrealistic. A number of people are still homeless, poor and crammed in townships   which were originally intended to be transit camps to fulfil the white by night   dream, promised to its voters by the apartheid rulers of the past. There is   no hope that these open jails could ever be dismantled for the next half a century.   This is not what the struggle was about. It would be different if we were all   starting from scratch. For the majority, unfortunately, things remain as they   were. To conclude, Chairperson, at the fifth point.\nLack of clarity about categories Finally the criteria for creating categories   was not clear. Who should really be called to the TRC? Is it the foot soldier   or the commander? We thought that all those impositions of responsibility needed   to do the accounting. If ministers or leaders of religious communities were   asked to make an appearance, why were teachers or university lecturers not asked   to make an appearance? There are many ways of killing a nation. One of the most   cruel ways of doing this is by attacking the nation's psyche and by so doing,   destroy its mind. Putting it to sleep, driving it to drunkenness and violence.   Destroying children of future leaders and future builders of the economy of   that particular nation. Chairperson, we want to submit that the architects of   most of this were academics in the employ of the apartheid system. Certain universities   are known to have been factories of all the commodities apartheid needed in   order for it to succeed. Besides those who studied at the so-called bush colleges,   know what it means to be taught by academics who were actually soldiers or reserve   soldiers. These people, chairperson, were not under any duress. They were willingly   upholding the geology of apartheid. Yet these have been forgotten or not forced   to account to this commission. \nHaving clarified the points of our reservations, the present process however,   is a reality and we cannot wish it away. Therefore, a way forward, very briefly,   is a need to devise a mechanism of reconciliation beyond the TRC process, to   work out a way of restitution that will not tax the tax payer further, to call   on the religious community to have their own TRC, to work\ntowards the establishment of a national bank by the churches. We believe, as   ICT, that our submission will receive the attention it deserves, so that while   we work towards reconciliation, the essential channels of justice will not be   ignored.

Those are people at grassroots level who reflect   on what is happening, who reflect on the feelings, who reflect on everything   they are experiencing. What has been coming through is that there is some kind   of resentment to the fact that people go away with impunity and people are not   calling for the execution of others, they are not calling for the jailing of   others, but they are saying some form of mechanism that will show that people   are taking responsibility for what they have done would in fact be a step ahead.   People have quoted, for example, one of the cases during submissions here at   the amnesty hearings, from Derby-Lewis for example. Sorry to mention a name,   but we have to.

To   show that kind of acceptance of the past and attend to it with the humility   it deserves. There is a claiming of rights, almost unequalled even before apartheid,   from those who had rights even before.

The fact that   the church can go further than that and the fact that the church has already,   in its own way begun to look at, I don't think that the church begins to look   at repentance by an act of parliament. It looks at repentance from its own position   and I think this needs to be recognised.

            "Yes, in fact I was hoping that this would not come up,   because we have already responded to K. Burman over the air, we had a talk with   him. But I just want to say, firstly, I think ICT would not like to associate   itself with anything that is becoming an insult to people who are suffering.   And one can unfortunately not use very strong words to call K. Burman to order,   because you cannot say to someone who is suffering and is having a big stone   on that person's neck, and when that person is trying to remove the stone, you   say it was caused by others. It is an insult and despising the mentality of   people. Our response also was we were not aware that each and every person who   was throwing and stone was reading liberation theology. I just think that it   was a far-fetched generalisation and unfortunately he has this history of denigrating   all the people who were fighting for the people who were oppressed. SACC has   gone through his tongue lashing and it is most unfortunate that he should belong   to an organisation that is the Institute of Race Relations. I think that we   could say more, but I think all I can say in summary is that we will not accept   the insult that is levelled at people who are trying to do something against   their suffering, but saying they are influenced by other people. It's what the   government used to say and now we hear K. Burman saying the same thing.",

I mean, we were the   ones who actually tried to stop people from necklacing, but more than that,   we were the ones who kept begging the government, the previous government when   our people were dying, begging them \"Don't do this\", and we stood   between this country and catastrophe.

            "[inaudible] in their different and often exceedingly   painful way in the policy of apartheid. It is with all of them in mind that   this submission is being made. We need to be concerned about healing, reconciliation,   reconstruction, not only within South Africa itself, but also in neighbouring   countries where South Africa fought its wars, created serious destabilisation   and drew on migrant labour. Many of the millions of landmines lying in the soil   of Angola and Mozambique are a telling and terrible reminder of that process   in the apartheid period. It seems to me that the churches, which straddle these   national frontiers in the Southern African region, can play their part in promoting   healing, reconciliation and reconstruction, in partnership with governments   and others in this sub continent. Chairperson, it is well known, I think, that   the church I represent was clear in its official and public condemnation of   apartheid, eventually joining those who declared it to be a hierarchy and a   sin. These pronouncements came from a synodical structure of church government   in which black and white Anglicans participated together, providing and alternative   model in our race ridden society, which helped to point the way to the model   of true democracy which our country has at last embraced. During the last eight   years of the apartheid regime, from 1986 to 1994, our church was presided over   in its life and synodical government by a black Archbishop, who by sheer example   demonstrated once and for all how crazy, let alone immoral the alternative apartheid   model was for our society. Yet, this same Archbishop, I hardly need to remind   you, Chairperson, did not have a vote in the land of his birth. But the picture   I have just painted of our church, though true, is far too rosy. The whole truth   contains compromise, complacency, and complicity, alongside examples on the   part of some individuals of great courage and compassion. The fact of the matter   as our written submission makes clear, is that the membership of the CPSA, is   varied and complex. Within the perspective of the TRC, it includes a clear majority   - some 2 million people - who were victims of apartheid, and a minority were   its beneficiaries, including some who were even its perpetrators. I well remember   a synod resolution in which it was decided that any Anglican who was in the   security police could not be elected to serve on a parish council. The opposition   to this decision in some quarters of our church was immediate. Yet we did allow   for the appointment of Anglican priests as military chaplains to minister to   the pastoral needs of white conscripts and professionals in the South African   Defence Force. This came to be a deeply divisive issue in our church, with parents   of conscripts complaining bitterly that we did not have enough chaplains to   minister to their sons and black Anglicans bitterly opposed to having any chaplains   at all. In our diocese of Namibia, there was the particular embarrassment where   the bishop there could not possibly approve of South African military chaplains   coming to support what he and his people perceived to be an army of occupation.   The liberation movements were also supported[TAPE ENDS] [inaudible]   between the pastoral and the prophetic in the life and witness of the church.   How does the church achieve a balance between these two? In the closing years   of apartheid rule, the bishops of the CPSA resolved to appoint no more military   chaplains. At about the same time, the call for economic sanctions which you,   Chairperson, had issued much earlier in a single handed act of moral courage,   was supported corporately by the bishops of the CPSA and indeed by its highest   synod, in the year 1989. It could be said, and I would include myself in this   stricture, that we took too long to come to this place of a clearer uncompromising   witness. We allowed others to proceed us and take the flack. Too late, conceded   that they were right and we owe them an apology for our compromising and often   complacent half-heartedness and sometimes, for a hardness of heart that could   be extremely damaging and hurtful. Archbishop, you yourself bore the brunt of   this critique not only in the nation at large, but even from the membership   of your own church. May I, on behalf of the CPSA, offer to you a profound apology,   ask for your forgiveness and thank you for your extraordinary graciousness and   magnanimity. May I also, through you, extend a similar message to all our other   prophets, both within the Anglican Church and beyond it, thanking them for their   courageous witness in the name of Christ to the truth? Chairperson, paragraph   ten of the CPSA's written submission says, and I quote \"That the CPSA   acknowledges that there were occasions when, through the silence of its leadership   or its parishes or their actions in acquiescing with apartheid laws, where they   believed it to be in the interest of the church, deep wrong was done to those   who bore the brunt of the onslaught of apartheid. What aided and abetted this   kind of moral lethargy and acquiescence was the fact that in many respects,   our church had developed, over many years, its own pattern of racial inequality   and discrimination. It was all too easy to pass resolutions or make lofty pronouncements   condemning apartheid. It was all too easy to point a morally superior finger   at Afrikaner nationalist, prejudice and pride. English pride and prejudice was   no less real and it was never very far below the surface of our high sounding   moral pronouncements. The Anglican Lord Milner must be as problematic to Afrikaner   Christians as D.F. Malan, the dominee, is to us. In a strange way, I think many   white Anglicans in the CPSA owe an apology to the Afrikaner community for their   attitude of moral superiority. I became aware of this need when as bishop of   Pretoria from 1976 to 1981; I got to know such fine Afrikaner Christians as   David Bosch and Piet Meiring. Perhaps, Chairperson, I could ask Professor Piet   Meiring in his capacity as a member of the TRC kindly to receive this expression   of apology from an Archbishop of \"die Engelse Kerk\". APPLAUSE.\nBut our chief expression of apology must be to our own black membership, and   I am using the word \"black\" inclusively. Here we are speaking of the   overwhelming majority of the CPSA, both in Southern Africa as a whole and in   South Africa particularly. Interestingly, our black membership increased significantly   in the early apartheid years, especially on the reef where the witness against   the new ideology was strong. Ours is primarily a black church; it has been and   still is in many ways, a suffering church. Suffering at the hands of the church   itself. Chairperson, our so-called white parishes like white businesses, and   I am thinking of last week's TRC hearings, have unquestionably benefited from   apartheid and its political predecessors, in that church facilities, including   housing and transport for their priests, they have been bastions of relative   privilege. So-called black parishes by contrast, like black businesses, have   been decidedly disadvantaged in these respects. Within the black Anglican community,   there has been a further disparity in that very often, as in the secular apartheid   scenario, the African church has been worse off than the coloured, and the coloured   church worse off than the Indian. We have simply reflected in so many ways the   economic and social disparities at large. There was a time, as you pointed out   earlier this morning yourself, your Grace, there was a time when even clergy   stipends were paid on a racially different basis, with all kinds of clever justifications   produced for what was essentially and ethically unacceptable practice. \nAttempts are now being made to rectify these long-standing inequities within   the life of our church. Black advancement into leadership roles has been significant,   but still within our church structures, we are significantly dependant on white   skill and expertise which can easily look and feel like white power blocking   the aspirations of black people. A transformation process is underway, spearheaded   by a recently created black Anglican forum. This will promote and facilitate   an adjustment process for the CPSA, as it moves into the new millennium, seeming   to provide a new authenticity for our life together as a church, setting us   free to be more truly African in the broadest sense, to engage in our mission   and ministry in a more authentic incarnational way. Chairperson, this is one   of the ways in which our denomination sees its commitment to the future of this   country and this sub-continent. To be a transformed church under God, serving   a transformed society. Central to that task will be our desire to contribute   to a continuing process of healing and costly, not cheap, reconciliation. I   speak as a church leader now in a province which has seen well over 15 000 politically   motivated killings in a decade of traumatic transition. The healing of the resultant   wounds, let alone the other wounds, which are the legacy of apartheid, will   engage the faith communities and others for a long time to come. One of the   things which the Kwa Zulu Natal Leaders Group is planning for 1998, is a series   of pastoral visits to places of pain, where in the company of local communities,   liturgies of healing and cleansing will occur and symbolic actions will take   place to facilitate reconciliation. Similarly, trauma workshops and workshops   of repentance and restitution are available in our province to enable people   bruised by a divided past to come together in a wholesome healing atmosphere   in the presence of skilled facilitators which seem so essential to find new   hope for their lives. \nI end with a final reflection or meditation on facets of the life of the CPSA,   which I represent here today, which I dearly love and for whose failings and   frailties I repent before God and this commission. I think of the Mother church,   St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town. Site of faithful witness and struggle over   many years, beacon of hope to the people alongside the parliament where so many   draconian laws were passed. I think by contrast of the faithful Nsekekuni Land,   going on annual pilgrimage to the gravesite at the top of a hill of Masemola,   their Martyr and ours. I think of the elderly member of the great mothers' union,   coming forward slowly and painstakingly to receive a certificate in honour of   her fifty years membership and I hear her responding in grateful thanksgiving   by singing in shaky voice, a hymn from the depths of her being. I think of a   small child coming forward to be confirmed \" Defend O Lord, this they   child\", and how I am struck by the innocence of her eyes and her folded   hands. I think of a colleague as a teenager, taking his critically ill father   to hospital, unaware that he would be refused admission because it was the white   man's hospital and going to another \"acceptable\" hospital where there   was only room for his father to lie on the floor, there to die, a short while   later. I think of this colleague, carrying this pain into adult life, into the   black consciousness movement, where he found his dignity was affirmed, and finally   finding full healing when as a priest, he was asked to be Rector of a white   congregation. I think of our present Archbishop, incarcerated as a young man   for three years a political prisoner on Robin Island, and there mysteriously   finding his vocation to be a priest. I think of Zeph Motokeng, standing as a   brave young layman in synod in the early apartheid years and challenging unsuccessfully   the unequal stipends paid to the clergy. I think of Trevor Huddlestone's naught   for your comfort and the costly intercessory prayer of the monks and nuns, fighting   apartheid on their knees, and yearning for a new freedom to dawn. I think of   those who understood none of these things, who were lost in their own limitations,   trapped in their own small world. I think and I think, and as I do so, I say   Lord have mercy. Nkosi siya ukele. Morene ragaukele. And then I say also \"Thank   God for your faithful ones, those who were clear sighted, those who endured   against all the odds to the end\".",

Thank you ever so much for that. I have one question.   I know that the panel have many questions they would like to put to you. You   said in your submission, you spoke about the majority of congregates who were   victims of apartheid, but then there was also the minority in the Anglican church,   mostly white people, who were the beneficiaries, in some cases even the perpetrators,   of the past. We have had this problem in the TRC in the past months. It seems   by and large that the black section of South Africa owns the process. It's been   difficult to get the white people on board. In some instances, gloriously, white   people, white Christians embraced the process. In m any instances we were disappointed.   Do you have advice for us? How do we get the white Christians, the people of   good faith to really embrace the process of the truth commission, but especially   to get them on board for the road for reconciliation after the life of the TRC?",

I think for those who have been   the beneficiaries of the apartheid regime and sometimes even the perpetrators   of the system, it's quite a threatening thing perhaps to come before a body   of this kind. It's certainly a risky process and I guess that is what is encouraging   a lot of white people in this country, including white Christians, to stay away.   Insofar as our own church is concerned, I think the fact that it is chaired   by who it is had encouraged many of us to accept the integrity of the commission   and look at the example that the commission has set over these last two years,   in my view, establishes its integrity in a very real way and one would simply   hope that people will be willing, even at this late stage to set aside their   unnecessary reservations and to recognise that part of their own healing and   their own liberation will involve coming forward out of their own integrity   and participating in the process.",

It's going   to take a long time. But I think it will hasten the process if the church decides   as early as possible to come together, black and white congregates in parishes   and really talk about these problems. Address these problems that happened and   say now we are opening our hearts to one another, accepting one another in   the Lord, forgiving one another.

Here again, it's quite difficult to encourage people to participate   in what is involved in that, but assisted by the insights and contribution of   Father Michael Lapsly, we have engaged upon a process whereby people across   the parish boundaries, as my brother Bishop was saying, have come together,   normally in fairly small groups so that there can be an interchange of depth,   have come together over a weekend to undertake an experience which involves   actually telling one another stories. And out of that process of listening to   one another, finding a new measure of healing and then gathering all that together   into an act of Eucharistic worship at the end of the weekend.

            "Thank you very much Mr. Chairperson. I want to commend Bishop   Michael for the way he presented that submission. It was moving. There are two   areas that I just want to have clarity on. One is that the CPSA in 1970 moved   a resolution which condemned the World Council of Churches for its support for   the program to combat racism and thus by doing so, affirming the policy of the   National Party, and those among our congregations who were against the liberation   movement. How does the church hope to handle that? To make an apology, or make   reparation, because I think inaudible. And the second one is Michael Lapsly   as you just said, on arrival at the airport was told that \"your license   has been withdrawn because you have publicly announced your political affiliation\"   by a bishop of the CPSA. Has there been an apology made to him for the way he   was handled, which in fact clearly gave the government of South Africa that   churches here were not going to take people who have declared themselves to   be part of the liberation movement. I think that there could be a significant   way that could be done to show that we acknowledge the wrongs we did at the   time.",

            "Thank you. I think on that first matter of the decision   in 1970 in regard to the World Council of Churches grants to liberation movements,   the whole issue has gone by default. I am not aware that there has been any   revisiting of that officially, within the life of our church. The reason for   that resolution, if I recall, it was the first time I attended a Provincial   Synod. I was quite young and immature at the time. But the reason for it was   that we didn't want to leave the impression that we were lending our support,   or that the church should be lending its support to movements that had decided   to engage in violence, as part of their strategy and we didn't hear the argument,   even if there was legitimacy for that point of view, we didn't hear the argument   that the grants were intended for humanitarian purposes within those liberation   movements and not for the purchase of arms. We didn't see any distinction between   those two. Looking back now, I would wish to say here that I think we erred   in that resolution in 1970, because it included a decision to withhold our subscription   from the WCC. Subsequently, we were prevented by government anyway from sending   any subscriptions to the WCC so we were nicely covered by the government itself,   but initially we took that decision and we have to take responsibility for it.   And I think it is right that we should acknowledge that that was a mistaken   decision looking back now, with the benefit of hindsight. On the issue of Father   Michael Lapsly and his license, I think if I may, I would prefer not to comment.   That may sound very much like chickening out, but I'm not sufficiently well   informed on the circumstances that surrounded that, something that I think happened   within the diocese of Lesotho at the time and it has been written about in the   biography of Michael Lapsly, that has now been published, maybe it is something   that needs to be visited. What I would like to say is that Michael Lapsly as   a result of (at least partly) what happened to him in the bombing, whereby he   lost both his hands and one eye, has become what I would consider to be a living   icon of redemptive suffering in the life of our church and our nation at this   time and somebody to be truly honoured and respected for that fact.",

We are better than we have been in the past,   I think, in making our appointments freely across the board. We are even better   at it at the moment perhaps within what I would call parishes (in the situation   that I come from) where the language is English and I don't mean only so-called   white parishes, but parishes where the language spoken is English. More and   more we are inviting clergy whose mother tongue is Zulu to take appointments   either as rectors or assistants in those parishes. For instance at the beginning   of next year we have a black African priest becoming rector of our parish at   Overport, which is traditionally an Indian area and one of the things that we   are discovering as indeed we are discovering the presence of women clergy in   our church now is that people, as a result of the actual experience of clergy   coming from different backgrounds, are experiencing a new inner liberation which   they didn't realise would happen and so it's an exceedingly pleasing process   to see. We are not doing it to the same extent the other way around - appointing   white priests into black parishes, if I may use that terminology. That is partly   for historical reasons because we used to have those parishes or those missions   as they were called in the past serviced by white clergy, mainly from overseas   and there has been a certain reaction to that. Within the black community itself,   with black priests wanting to take responsibility within their own cultural   and linguistic ...[indistinct] and idiom for that work. So I think we are going   to be moving in the not too distant future, back into a more healthy mixture,   but that is the historical reason that mixture doesn't exist to the same extent   there. We have moved away from something that was there before in order to facilitate   the advancement of black leadership at the request of black leadership in those   particular congregations. Of course, the challenge to English speaking clergy   whether they're white, coloured or Indian is that they need to learn the language,   and something of the culture. And that is something that we are continuing to   wrestle with in this time and I hope that as time goes by in this transformation   process, we will begin to make further progress in this field.",

It goes back to 1992. Perhaps we   should have made that decision long before, but like so many other churches   in this respect throughout the world, we have been on a journey and all of us   have had to come to a profound change of mind when we've come to the point of   accepting women clergy should be as free to operate within the life of our church   as men clergy. So, we've only been involved in this for the past five years.   We now have something like 23 women clergy out of 120 within the diocese, which   I'm part of. I like to think that increasingly we are making space for them   to participate fully in our affairs. We already have one of these priests as   an Archdeacon and as a member of the advisory body to the Bishop and the diocese   of finance and trustees. So perhaps the progress has been reasonable within   the short time in which we have enacted, but there's still a very long way to   go, and part of that long way to go is the need for the mindset to change because   so many of us across the board, this is not a white or black phenomenon, but   across the board, so many of us particularly those of us who are male but not   only men, have got to make a major inner adjustment to this new reality within   the life of our church.

I am not sure what the pattern is throughout   the life of our church, but certainly I think there is a desire to move in this   direction. We have recently in the diocese that I come from, seen the establishment   of half a dozen schools at local community level, initiated by parishes as a   result of a synod resolution asking for exactly that to take place. Together   with the foundation of two new bigger ventures than local community ventures,   schools more like the ones that you have just mentioned. So we are following   up on that tradition and the whole idea is to try and fill that vacuum that   has existed ever since the Bantu Education Act came into being and we lost our   schools for one reason or another as a result of that legislation and a sense   of the need for the church to re-engage in a whole new creative way in the whole   education process. And certainly that will be one of the areas in which we will   try to exercise our influence in regard to the spiritual and moral life of the   nation. May I just add in that regard that for me in regard to moral reconstruction,   one of the most crucial things as I see it is for people to helped, young and   older people alike, particularly the young, to be helped in this new dispensation   of freedom in which we find ourselves to make responsible choices. There are   some who seem to want to return to earlier tyrannies and censorships of the   past. I say no. We need to accept the reality of the new atmosphere of freedom   under which we now operate. But it lays upon us an even heavier responsibility   to assist one another, and particularly the young, in the making of responsible   choices and earning and living by those choices. And so there are a new set   of r's. We talked about the three r's of reading, writing and arithmetic. The   three r's of rights, responsibilities and relationships. Rights with responsibilities   exercised in the context of affirming relationships. That is where the making   of responsible choices really begins to come in and have some impact.

The church in those days was largely evangelical and reformed in character.   In 1870 a well-documented division took place which resulted in the formation   of the Church of the Province of South Africa. \nThese developments had a huge impact on the life of the Church of England.   It lost most of its properties and congregations and was finally rejected by   the rest of the Anglican Communion. It was left to a small community of Christians,   both black and white, to struggle for survival. Coloured and Indian congregations   were established at a later stage. It finally emerged from its struggle as the   Church of England in South Africa, a small group of people who were committed   to the evangelical reformed and Protestant convictions of its forebears. \nDevelopment When I entered the ministry in 1966 there were no more than five   churches in Cape Town and only two and half ministers, one being retired. In   fact there were no more than twenty-five churches countrywide. I came into a   denomination that was very small but committed to the bible as the word of God. \nIt was strongly pietistic in its ethos and consequently according to the times   in which we lived, separatist in its mentality. In the wider Anglican Communion,   we had been stigmatised as a recaltratent schismatic group of unreasonable right   wing evangelicals. Now to some extent, we have no one to blame for these views   but ourselves. We saw our theological position under threat and we acted accordingly.   When the government made legislation that accorded with our moral or biblical   understanding we supported them. However, on the great issue of justice for   all, we were often insensitive. We had not made the connection between gospel   and society. One of our Bishops took part in the state funeral for the assassinated   Dr. Verwoerd. Another of our Bishops by synodical decision took part in the   inauguration of FW de Klerk. \nThese actions were performed under the influence of our belief that we needed   to support and pray for the authorities ordained by God. [TAPE THREE] [inaudible]   under other circumstances whoever the dignitaries were, but we now see that   these things contributed to the impression that we endorsed the system. We consequently   gave the impression that we were supporters of the regime. This impression has   caused many of our members great pain in the past and all of us great embarrassment   in the present. \nThus, some of the impressions we gave were justified. However, we ignored all   these things because we felt we had a priority to preach and teach the gospel,   consolidate our work and begin to build it up. By 1979, there were 54 ordained   clergy in active ministry and within a further 10 years the number had increased   to 96. The denominations are administered as a single unit, with area councils   in the Cape Province, Kwa Zulu Natal Province and the Gauteng/Free State region. \nThere are presently 153 congregations in South Africa, 14 in Namibia and a   similar number in Zimbabwe, which are all self-administered. So you can see   we're a very small show. The establishment in 1989 of our own theological institution,   George Whitfield College, has produced clergy and ...[indistinct] with a new   awareness and involvement in the controversial moral, ethical and social issues   of the day. Our new academics and generating valuable insights into the ongoing   debates and tensions between faithfulness to the gospel and social responsibility,   something we deeply lacked in the past. \nThe struggle years The apartheid years, with the struggle for liberation caught   us completely off guard and unprepared. There were a number of reasons for this\n1. Our tiny group of churches was simply trying to survive. We considered ourselves   as nobodies. We had no influence, no outside contacts, apart from a few exceptions,   no money, no property of note. Yet we found a ready response to our message   in all sections of our society. While the struggle for liberation was deepening,   we got on with the job of building our churches. \n2. We had no theologians nor thinkers of note in our ranks, having been cut   off from the rest of the Anglican communion, we were not exposed to the thinking   and debate taking place there, nor were we privy to the wider network of information   to assist in raising awareness. Our church was led largely by lay-people because   of our lack of clergy. It was only in later years that theologically trained   men arose who were able to see things in better perspective and better understood   the times in which we lived.\n3. Many members of the Church of England in South Africa generally and honestly   believed the government's propaganda about the Communist threat. Like most other   whites, our white elect church believed that we were in a struggle for western   values and freedom, and that the liberation groups were all pawns of the Communist   regime. \n4. Many victims of apartheid and oppression find it hard to believe whites   when they plead ignorance. We ask them to moderate their judgement. Most of   you here today will remember that Jesus once performed half a miracle. He touched   a man's eyes, who was blind, and he only half saw and described his experience   as seeing men as trees walking. He needed a second touch. The truth is that   the full extent of the atrocities exposed by the TRC were in fact not known   to us. Many suspected but were probably reluctant to believe these stories.   Previously when stories of atrocities leaked out, it was usually attributed   to Communistic forces trying to undermine the government. The exposures by the   TRC have filled many white people and many of us in the Church of England in   South Africa with shock, shame and revulsion. Looking back, it is amazing that   we were so naive. Be that as it may, the fact of the matter is that we   allowed ourselves to be misled into accepting a social, economic and political   system that was cruel and oppressive. \n5. A further complication was the development of liberation theology. Now the   impact of this particular ideology on evangelicals must not be under estimated.   First of all, evangelicals have often been misunderstood and misrepresented   in the popular media. Sometimes, of course, it is their own fault because of   their unwise behaviour, but fanatics, unschooled rejecters of technological   development, bible punchers who are unconcerned with the social needs of people   and huge hysterical performances of healing and hysteria are not representative   of true evangelicals. But this is the way evangelicals were sometimes represented   in the media and by some who expounded liberation theology. We certainly deserved   a lot of the criticism we received as evangelicals. But we ask that the difficulties   we faced at least be understood, even though not condoned. Some evangelicals   saw liberation theology as a sell-out of the gospel of Christ crucified and   risen to a secular vision of Utopia on earth. There was a sense of dismay among   evangelicals as we saw the gospel of Christ's redemption redefined to suit the   mood and the agenda of the day. Many evangelicals felt that while liberation   theology had recaptured the important truths of justice in society, it had in   the process assimilated an ideology that undermined the basic message of the   gospel. That is how we, in the Church of England in South Africa felt at the   time. And therefore we in the Church of England in South Africa found ourselves   in a dilemma. To get on board the social action programs and protest movements   was to identify with the theological emphasis, which we saw as a betrayal of   Christ's message. As we distanced ourselves from liberation theology, we were   therefore seen to support the system even further. Yet we knew by this time   that the struggle for justice was justified. We, however, had different views   and were uncertain about what to do. The Church of England in South Africa thought   that, because of its smallness and insignificance, because of our lack of debating   power, and also because of the reigning confusion of the age, our way forward   was to continue with the teaching and the preaching of the word of God and to   establish churches and help programs where we could. We declared ourselves to   be a-political and in this way failed to adequately understand the suffering   of our many black members who were victims of apartheid. Our failure to be involved   in the political struggles of our land was a major error in both understanding   and judgement and this mistake has caused us a great deal of embarrassment,   heartache and pain.\n6. In spite of these failures, during those tumultuous years, we established   social community projects such as feeding schemes in under privileged schools,   a community centre with various activities in Khayelitsha where one of our white   volunteer workers was shot and maimed, AIDS centres for adults and children   in Kwa Zulu Natal, nursery schools country wide, amongst other things. We held   to our conviction that Christ's kingdom is ultimately not of this world. But   we did believe as do most Christians, that it must be demonstrated in this world.   And yet we remained confused at the every deepening political crisis and the   challenge to our own theological pre-suppositions. \n7. There were occasions after our annual synods when we communicated with and   sought meetings with various government officials to protest privately about   various matters. A delegation of senior leaders once met with Mr. P.W. Botha   when he was State President to express concern about the wrongs in South Africa.   While on several occasions our presiding Bishop, personally encouraged Mr. F.W.   de Klerk when he was State President, to hasten change. We found both men receptive   to our approach, although we do not know what it accomplished. It was dialogue   rather than confrontation. That was our modus operandi. However, we now see   that instead of helping our cause, it hindered it. The reason for this was our   failure to report back to our local leadership and their congregations and this   reinforced the view that we were supporters of the government and not critics.   It must also be said that on local levels, stands were taken on certain issues   which we failed to publicise or to which we failed to draw attention. For instance,   one of our churches in the Northern suburbs of Cape Town opened a pre-school   education facility which was open to all race groups. They resisted considerable   government pressure to change their policy. In addition in years gone by, protest   was may by our previous leadership to the army's activities in Ovambo. And also   after World War 2, to the educational policies of the government as they applied   to black people. In 1988 the late Reverend Murray Hoffmeyer and I spent two   hours with a government commission discussing the question of the Group Areas   Act in which we vigorously argued for the abolition of that Act. In addition   to that, we also over the years, voiced our opposition to the migratory system   which had disruptive impact on families. Now these things are mentioned not   to exonerate us, but to indicate that we were not entirely unaware or silent.   However, we were too naive to keep minutes and records, because many of these   activities took place spontaneously off the cuff, so to speak. Nor did we think   it important to inform all our church members of what we were doing. In any   event, we recognise and fully admit that whatever we did was too little and   too late.\n8. It should be noted at this point that when we were able to travel overseas,   we were surprised by queries concerning segregation in the churches. Many of   our friends thought segregation was practised by all churches, including us.   But this has not been our practice. Our understanding of the gospel led us to   believe that all l people should be welcome at any worship service. While some   denominations may have held to a policy of segregation, the Church of England   in South Africa did not. However, it must be added that while our services were   always open to all, not all could come. The apartheid laws had created both   geographical and language problems so that it remained true that most of our   congregations were either predominantly white, coloured, Indian or black. During   these times, the leadership of the Church of England in South Africa was not   discerning enough to see the significance of this. But since the early eighties,   any indications of discrimination in the Church of England in South Africa's   constitution, in our national structures and practices have been systematically   removed. This is an ongoing process, assisted greatly by new awareness and sensitivity   as well as new thinking by all in leadership. Now these reasons are not offered   as excuses, but rather as an explanation of whom we were during the struggle   years. We do not apologise for our stand on the central message of the bible.   However, we do want to express our apology, our sorrow and regret at the things   we left undone. We refer to article 12 in our statement of faith, 39 Articles   of Religion entitled Good Works. Quote \"Although good works, which are   the fruits of faith and follow after our justification, cannot put away our   sin and are subject to the severity of God's judgement. Yet inasmuch as they   are done in Christ and for his sake, they are pleasing and acceptable to God   for they spring necessarily from true and vital faith and are indeed the evidence   of a vital faith, just as a tree is recognised by its fruit\". Insofar as   the search for justice is part of the Christian's good works, we believe we   have failed. \n9. The awakening Our own awakening to the true state of oppression in our   nation developed gradually. In the Cape particularly, where contact with the   coloured community was easier than with the black community, the heartache and   injustice were increasingly conveyed to us. Bishop Martin Morrison worked tin   Sowed and Bishop Joe Bell worked in Natal. They were regularly faced with the   consequences of the political system and became increasingly distressed. The   tense years of the early nineties with the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the   subsequent election brought political reality home to us all. The culmination   for the Church of England in South Africa came on Sunday night the 25th July   1993 with the massacre at St. James Church, which had from its inception been   a non-racial church. Apart from other considerations at the time, we realised   with what fear many people in the oppressed communities lived. It brought a   new awareness to us. As stated, the subsequent revelations made the truth and   reconciliation commission have left us all deeply shocked and our own experience   reinforced this sense of shock. The truth had come home to us. \n10. Conclusion As we reflect on the past and look to the future, there are   several things we would like to say. \n10.1 Notwithstanding that many in the white community saw the evil of apartheid   and its out working, many did not and may not have chosen to. That stands as   a sombre lesson of how whole communities and countries can be misled by skilful   leaders. It has happened before and no doubt it will happen again.\n10.2 While we believe that many of the government officials of the old regime   were sincere Christians, nevertheless, we were a witness to how the bible and   its message can be misused to support an evil ideology. National government   used the bible to support its policies, to give the impression that they were   a Christian government. But then so did some liberation theologians who finally   supported violence as a means of continuing the struggle. They argued that the   crucifixion of Jesus sanctioned violence as a method of obtaining freedom. At   least we heard that argument. This particular interpretation of the death of   our Lord was highly offensive to us and served only to alienate us and other   evangelicals even further from those involved in the more visible aspects of   the struggle. It is well worth noting at this commission that many evangelicals   would have been more involved in the struggle had it not been for the particular   theological justification which was presented and which served to confuse us   even further. In the Church of England in South Africa, we remain convinced   that the primary task of the ordained minister is to explain the true message   of the bible without adding his own agenda to it. This message fully explained   and applied includes the proclamation that Jesus is Lord over all, including   our society and its laws. It further includes the command to love our neighbour   with special reference to the poor, the needy, the oppressed and the doing of   good works. Not as a ground for our justification before God, but as our expression   and fruit of it as explained in article 12 referred to earlier. We in the Church   of England in South Africa therefore feel the need to pray the words of the   confession in our morning service Almighty and most merciful Father, we have   strayed from your ways like lost sheep. We have left undone what we ought to   have done and we have done what we ought not to have done.\n10.3 The Church of England in South Africa, especially the whites, must accept   collective responsibility for its role in the injustices of the past. Although   largely ignorant and unwitting, we were nevertheless passive and compliant.   We benefited from the status quo. Up until the early 1970's our largely white   leadership, and I'm sure all too many of our white church members being children   of their culture, no doubt practised some forms of discrimination either in   action of attitude. With hindsight, we should have been more aggressive in campaigning   against the evils and injustices of apartheid, more vociferous in opposing violence   in all its forms and far more active in our programs of social upliftment and   evangelism. We should have been more aware, more vocal and insightful, but we   were not. For this we are guilty. We confess our imperfections and are truly   repentant. Where we have been negligent, careless and insensitive to biblical   injunctions and mandates as we have been, may the Lord graciously forgive us.   Where our actions, our silence or our acquiescence has been the cause of added   hardship, pain and suffering to any of our Christian brothers and sisters, to   any of our other fellow south Africans, we ask for forgiveness. In regard to   the black members of our own denomination, we admit that we were unable to fully   understand the full extent of their pain and suffering. However, we attempted   to provide leadership in terms of financial support for their churches and families,   spiritual encouragement and the arm of fellowship. There were occasions when   we spoke to the authorities on behalf of our members who were harassed or in   trouble. In fact it is true to say that all our presiding Bishops gave a great   deal of time and effort, probably most of their time and effort to minister,   encourage and assist our black congregations. In our ranks at present, various   discussions are taking place to facilitate confession, repentance, reconciliation   and healing. Our stance that we were not a political church was an attempt to   emphasis our commitment to the central message of the gospel. But it was also   a great failure to truly understand and apply the gospel. In this regard, we   were guilty of sinning against our Lord and our brothers and sisters. We pray   for grace that never again will be fail in our duty.\n10.4 We are conscious that any participation we may now have in public debate   must arise out of the context of our understanding of our past failure to speak   out. Our response to society must arise out of a response to the gospel and   not out of political pragmatism. Or a hypocritical desire to create the right   impression. As our understanding of the gospel and its implication grows, so   must our obedience. This includes a new understanding of the need to seek greater   understanding and fellowship with other church groups, even those with whom   we may not see eye to eye. \n10.5 The Church of England in South Africa remains convinced that its function   is to continue to clearly teach and preach the word of God. To this task we   re-dedicate ourselves. We have no wish to repeat past mistakes, nor to compromise   our message in any way in the future. But Christians now face new challenges.   The rebuilding of our society and the establishment of an ongoing culture of   justice and compassion is an obvious case in point. To this end, our theological   institutions are training a new generation of thinkers equipped to minister   within the socio-political political realities of South Africa and to enter   into dialogue and debate with those with whom we formerly had very little contact.   Another challenge is the ongoing struggle to uplift the poor and needy and to   think through the issue of the redistribution of wealth from a Christian perspective.   To this end we shall continue to develop our existing programs dealing with   education, health and poverty. In addition, there are other ethical challenges   of the day in relation to crime and corruption, abortion, pornography, gambling   and the proposed decriminalisation of prostitution, to mention just a few. To   this end we remain committed to active participation in these debates. One of   the most challenging issues is the rise of religious pluralism. We agree that   respect and tolerance are called for and we welcome the opportunity for other   faiths to state their case. If I may pause here for just a moment to say the   during the days of the trauma of the massacre in our church, there were representatives   of the other faiths who were there at our doorstep as soon as they could get   there to express their solidarity and condolences with us, for which we are   deeply grateful. However, we need to say that we do not feel able to accommodate   all the compromises asked for in relation in other faiths. We have distinctive   convictions which are non-negotiable. The fact that the bible was used in the   past to condone injustice does not mean its true message may be ignored today.   We believe in the uniqueness not only of Jesus, but also of the God of the old   and new testaments. We believe the message of the gospel to be as relevant today   as its was 2000 years ago. We still believe that that message is the message   of reconciliation to God first and foremost and that reconciliation of one to   another is a fruit of our reconciliation to God. The re-establishment of a moral   framework referred to earlier this morning also in our opinion stems from a   living relationship with God, the power of the Holy Spirit and the teaching   of the bible. We believe in the return of our Lord Jesus Christ to this world   and in the setting up of a day of judgement. To this end we work in witness.   We pray for courage to hold to the truth and for endurance to reflect that truth   in the way we serve our Lord in society and for humility in all aspects of our   witness. We do not expect all to agree with us and we pray for grace to accept   any criticisms. We pledge ourselves, nevertheless to the search for fellowship   where possible, and to work for Christian reconciliation as far as we are able.   I conclude by saying that we received very little notification that we were   to make a submission and consequently were not able to consult extensively with   all concerned parties regarding this document. Nevertheless, the sorrow and   repentance that we express today is real. Our desire to truly live for Christ   and proclaim his gospel is genuine. Our determination to right past wrongs in   our own ranks as far as possible is sincere. In spite of sins and imperfections,   we still declare ourselves Christians. We can do no other expect to pledge ourselves   to do better. It is our belief that this day and hour calls for men and women   of conviction and integrity to apply the message of the bible more accurately   and faithfully to our emerging society. Regretful though the past may have been,   we know that we cannot live in it forever. Changes have come and no doubt will   still come, but the duty of all Christian churches is to preach Christ Jesus,   who is the same yesterday, today and forever. As representative of and on behalf   of all members of the Church of England in South Africa, I thank you Chairperson   for the opportunity to make this public submission on our particular role in   South Africa's history. May we all by God's grace grasp this opportunity to   secure a righteous and a just future for those who have suffered and especially   for our children.",

            "Thank you your Grace. The submission by the Church of England   is the main submission submitted to the commission in July. It is very brief   and very scant. I see that the submission that you have been reading from just   now is really supposed to be the main submission on which we should have formulated   our questions. Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to raise any questions   which are contained in that submission at this stage, because we have to study   it and then prepare our questions. Perhaps, your Grace, we could come back to   the Church of England with questions on that main submission once it is submitted   to us. For now I'm going to be raising questions which are based on this submission   which is a two page document.\nYou mention in your submission that gruesome attack on your members in worship   at St. James and the Chairperson has already referred to that and conveyed our   sympathy. That attack shocked the whole country. But I want to ask what impact   did that have for your own church, for your own denomination in terms of opening   up your hearts and minds to other gruesome attacks which have taken place in   the country. Not very far from here there is a church here in Mdanstane, which   was equally attacked by the Ciskei Police. People were shambokked and teargassed.   Did this event make your members relate to these kind of events which have been   happening to other people who are Christians, in this country.",

            "The answer to that is most definitely so. It was obviously an   horrendous event and an event that traumatised not only our church but actually   quite an interesting experience for us in the aftermath for us to be able to   see how events like this traumatise people. For instance, not only were our   church members traumatised, but their relatives living around the country who   knew that they attended the church were all traumatised. The neighbours living   in the area were traumatised. The children who were in our service that night   - we have scores and scores of children coming on Sunday nights as well as Sunday   morning - who happened to be in a different part of the building for their own   program were deeply traumatised, but all of their school friends were also traumatised   because they knew that those friends of theirs come to our church. So it was   a vast network of hurt and pain that was created by that event and we had to   try to deal with all of that. Without a doubt one of the first reflections that   came home to us after we were able to dust ourselves off, if I can put it that   way, is that this is how large numbers of our fellow South Africans were living.   It was with this kind of terror and fear and we took great pains to state publicly   at the time that we realised that that massacre was not the only massacre that   had taken place in South Africa and that we were not the only victims of violence   and it gave us a fresh appreciation of the absolute terror with which many,   many people lived, especially in the townships where unprotected people lived.   Many of them who did not have the infrastructure to be able to cope with it   as we had, or the support systems that we had. It did have a profound impact   on us in that regard.\nREV.",

So we were part of that group of people that had separated church   and society. Now having said that, I want to also say that it's not that we   had no concern for society or the needs of the people around and about us. We   were evolving in our thinking and were not helped by the fact that we did not,   at that stage in our church's history, have thinkers in our ranks who could   help us and assist us. Our theological training was limited and we had a largely   lay leadership in those days because of the historical aspect of our church's   beginnings and many of those lay leaders, many of them, came from overseas and   they had their own view of things and we were younger and not able always to   understand what they doing or saying or thinking. It's only as we grew and developed   and matured ourselves, that things began to change. But as we did begin to evolve   and change, what we would like the commission to know is that our conviction   is that all social justice stems out of a prior commitment to Jesus Christ as   Lord and Saviour. It is the fruit of being a Christian, it's not the root of   being a Christian and it is at that point that we were so stumbled, so confused   and bewildered by the arguments of liberation theology at the time, because   it seemed to us that the message of liberation theology had changed the very   root of the gospel. We may have misunderstood it, but that is how it appeared   to us at the time and formed part of our confusion.\nREV.",

            "Well, I'm going to try to answer that and then maybe some of   my colleges might want to comment on that as well. The bible affects our day   to day lives quite obviously and it did even in those days. However, let me   just say that our style of operating our church, our denomination, is not the   same as say the church of the province of any other Anglican diocese anywhere   in the world.. We had no central resources, we had nothing. All of our churches   are self-supporting. We had no buildings, most of our churches today are new   churches that have been built. Our congregations have been carved largely out   of the rocks of the ground, if I can put it that way. If the congregations do   not pay the stipend, the ministers to not get paid. That is how we work. We   do not have a central payment system, so there was no need for us to enter into   the sort of debates that the church of the province had as far as stipends were   concerned. Except that most of our black churches were in poor rural areas,   where there was no hope of them ever paying for themselves. So they were heavily   subsidised by the white churches. So white churches usually paid for their own   expenses and for one or two black churches, or paid into a central fund to help   the black churches as far as we could. It was always a struggle for money as   it is even today. It was mentioned earlier on today, and it always will be.   But that was our commitment then and that is our commitment now. And so we continue   to try to help at the same time and to try to uplift the various congregations.   That's how we operated as a denomination in regard to each other. As far as   the laws of the state were concerned, I refer to my comments in our submission   where I tell you that we needed the second touch from the Lord Jesus Christ.   We had blind spots, we were wrong. We have no excuses except to say that we   believed the lies, the subterfuge, that we were blind and looking back now we   can't believe that we were so blind, but I suppose that all people who are converted   feel like that after they have been converted. And so we are grateful to our   Lord, Jesus Christ, for touching our eyes a second time. I do not know if some   of the others would like to comment.",

And I   think as was stated in the submission, one of our real faults and sins is that   in the areas of society and culture, we were somewhat short-sighted to say the   least.

            "The Chairman of the commission, the most Reverend Desmond   Tutu and the Commissioners. The Methodist Church of Southern Africa appreciates   the invitation to make this submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.   I would like to point out, Sir, that the Methodist Church of Southern Africa   covers six countries in our sub-continent. Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho,   Mozambique and South Africa. Sir, our appearance before the TRC is not a mere   formality. Rather, it is a quest to offer our apology to South Africa for our   shortcomings, when this country was afflicted with apartheid. And to confess   our co-operation with that system, both intentionally and unintentionally. We   have agonised with the question of whether a conference can confess on behalf   of its local societies or not. We believe that it is our obligation to offer   our corporate confession, trusting that our societies and members share in the   spirit of this confession. On the other hand Sir, this confession does not seek   to prevent those of our members who may have violated the human rights of others   from making their individual submissions to this body. In fact, we have sought   to encourage such people to approach the TRC for that purpose. Whilst the Methodist   Church of Southern Africa can claim to have endeavoured to stand with other   religious communities in rejecting the policy of apartheid from its codification   in 1948, we do not believe that this opportunity is for us to parade our efforts.   Rather we wish humbly to face those shortcomings that compromised our witness   to the Lord Jesus Christ. We confess that on many occasions we failed to live   up to the mission of our Lord, to preach the good news to the poor and proclaim   freedom for the prisoners. We have, over many years, struggled with our failures   and a number of times through our conference resolutions we faced these and   sought to bring them to the attention of our people in a spirit of repentance.   In 1960, we offered this confession \"The Methodist Conference of Southern   Africa recognises that christian people and groups, whilst responsible for contributing   towards the solution of the problems of humanity by interpreting the mind of   Christ in the situation of South Africa, they themselves are deeply involved   in these problems. We as a church, confess that many of our own members are   guilty of race prejudice and are prone to the very sins that we regard as our   duty to condemn.\"\nIn 1976 we again struggled with our failure. We confessed that in the life   of our churches, we had not sufficiently shown the possibility of an alternative   to racial discrimination and group selfishness. That our fellow countrymen have   not been able to look at our churches and say, \"See how these christians   love one another\". We confessed too that as leaders of the christian churches   we had failed to give justice and reconciliation high priority. We pointed to   the tragic events of 1976 as having brought home to us the need to hear God's   word to us at that moment of our national history and to mobilise all our resources   for the urgent cause of our people's freedom. In response to the debate on disinvestment   in 1985, conference confessed that in our churches there had been no proper   debate and consideration of the disinvestment question because we had allowed   ourselves to be restrained by the severity of laws designed to prevent open   discussion of economic sanctions. This meant that the only arguments being heard   in South Africa were those is opposition to disinvestment. In 1986 conference   admitted its own failure to grapple timeously with the issues of great importance   to the disadvantaged people of South Africa and acknowledged that well intentioned   decisions on their part had sometimes been mistaken for indecisiveness and lukewarm   commitment to the liberation of our people. Conference asked for forgiveness   for its failure and for grace to respond more adequately. In 1988, when our   conference recognised that the concept of a peace church had been rejected by   its synod, it confessed that we had failed as a church to give sufficient attention   to God's call to be peacemakers and thus to provide an alternative to violent   action to change. That we failed to provide sufficient opportunity for consultation   and study of the peace church concept. We confessed that there were deep divisions   within the church over the issue of the peace church. Sir, we now ask that these   confessions presented in the past to the Methodist people be heard and met with   forgiveness by the public of our beloved land. These are not the only failures   we have to confess, there are many more. We allowed our skewed society values   to dictate our actions. We paid unequal stipends to our ministers. We trained   our ministers incorrectly and in most cases we did not equip our ministers for   the struggle against apartheid. We stationed our ministers racially ensuring   that both black and white congregations were locked into their own separate   cultural worlds instead of allowing them to be informed by one another. For   a long time we did not recognise black leadership in our midst. Sir, the list   is endless. We are grateful to God that the holy spirit continues to disturb   us. Both our confessions recorded in our minutes, conference after conference,   and our efforts to respond to these injustices point to a people who felt caught   in the complexity of our common sinful life, unable to find the boldness to   move together to the future that we knew God desired for us in this land. The   opposition of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa to apartheid was compromised   by fear of possible consequences of radical action, but undue sensitivity to   the views of its economic powerful white constituencies. By insensitivity to   the aspirations of the black majority, by undue respect for the institution   of government and above all, by a failure to adequately express at local level   the principles which it proclaimed in its official conference pronouncements.   A great number of Methodists, ministers and lay persons in all sections of the   community, remained silent and uninvolved and many defended their inactivity   by seeking to separate these fears of religion and politics. The Methodist Church   acknowledges its failure to convince such people of the integral link between   the gospel and justice and to make them aware of the socio-economic and political   implications of christian discipleship. We continued to examined our life in   co-operation with the other churches in the witness of the SACC and later in   the work of the Rustenberg Declaration. We are grateful to God that in spite   of our shortcomings we were given strength to resist the evil of apartheid.   In spite of extreme government pressure, we refused to withdraw our membership   from the World Council of Churches. A number of our pulpits fearlessly proclaimed   a wholesome gospel that prophetically declared that the people of South Africa   will be free. We constantly focused our prayers to the cause of justice and   to the discomfort of many, we used sometimes symbols that sought to keep the   hope alive for a new South Africa to dawn. A number of our ministers suffered   public humiliation at the hands of the government and its agents of evil. A   large number of Methodist families suffered at the hands of the tyrannical system,   as they responded to the prophetic call to resist apartheid. These, for us,   are not a cause for boasting, for the pain that accompanied such witness is   still pulsable. In 1978 the Methodist Church of Southern Africa suffered a major   blow when it was banned and declared an undesirable organisation from Transkei,   one of the areas where Methodism is strongest in Southern Africa. All our properties   in Transkei were confiscated without compensation. The most valuable of them   were then sold and they are now lost to us. Apartheid effectively wanted to   alienate the Methodist Church from part of its roots in the Eastern Cape. The   reason being simply the refusal of our conference in 1977 to accommodate the   fracturing of the people of Southern Africa according to their ethnic backgrounds   and their balkanisation into independent Bantu states. For ten years we were   forbidden from ministering to our mothers and fathers. We were forbidden from   bearing our own without the permit of the oppressor. To minister to our own   people, turned either into a criminal offence or an act for which one could   be labelled ...[inaudible] from the Church Catholic. Today we wish to offer   an unreserved apology to those who felt that our refusal to minister in Transkei   under these stringent conditions imposed by that government was to abandon them.   We also wish to offer an apology on behalf of those who felt compelled by the   needs of our members there to serve within the Methodist churches formed according   to the law of the government of Transkei. The wounds of that blow are still   fresh for us, because some of our people were permanently alienated from us   as a result. We deeply long for a reconciled Methodist Community, restored to   its full fellowship and connection. We thank God for the changes that have come   to our land. We wish to state without ambiguity that we are committed to our   responsibility to help bring healing and reconciliation to South Africa. We   will continue to build racially mixed congregations where individuals are honoured   and their heritage welcomed for the growth of all together. We have committed   ourselves to joining hands with other christian communities to fight hunger   and poverty, which is often, if not always, a direct consequence of our unjust   history. We are prepared to be in dialogue with people who may have a claim   on some of our property, as a result of having been unjustly removed from their   land. We have called on our congregations to use our facilities for projects   that will assist those who were denied opportunities to gain valuable skills   for their future. We have opened our facilities for healing and counselling   sessions such as Kulumani, and we have set as one of the three goals of our   connection that the church at every level will encourage the creation of speaking   forums where people can speak about their pain and help one another to heal.   We are deeply conscious of the breakdown of morality in our land as a result   of apartheid and we seek to place emphasis again on values such as family life,   that were broken down by apartheid acts such as the migratory labour laws. We   have, and we will continue to write liturgies that allow people to look back   at their history and see that their heroes were not victims, but people, who   like Jesus, laid their lives down for the freedom of the nation. We will endeavour   not to flinch or hesitate when required to say a prophetic word that will help   our country and all its organs so that we will never allow ourselves to repeat   the mistakes of the past as a nation. We believe that it is all the people of   South Africa who must have the will to move their country to a destine of freedom,   wealth, charity and respect for creation and human dignity. We believe that   it is our task that we should appeal to the gospel of Jesus Christ for such   a will to be nurtured and strengthened among our people. I thank you Sir.",

I also want to start in saying   how you have raised our feelings in your submission about trying to reveal the   total truth and the position of the Methodist Church as such for all the things   that happened in the period of our repression. I do, however, want to put one   or two questions just for clarity. You have listed say in page 2 for instance   what the Methodist Church did in terms of resolutions. There is a period I want   to ask about that does not appear in that submission. Remember in 1970 all the   mainline churches and their relations made the resolution which condemned the   World Council of Churches for their attitude to support the programme to combat   racism. And if I remember correctly, the Methodist Church also made such a resolution.   That resolution resulted in probably giving an indication to the government   of South Africa and the rest of the world community that the churches are indeed   against the liberation movements. Would you like to make a comment on that?",

            "Yes. You will recall that in my submission I have made   reference to the tensions that existed within the Methodist Church itself. It   is not my intention to try and speak about our church as a divided body, because   we are trying all we can still to help one another to get to a position where   we will have a reconciled attitude to our history. The Methodist Church at that   time officially did express its uncertainty about the programme to combat racism,   but at the same time it affirmed the responsibility of the World Church to raise   questions against apartheid and one of the reasons the Methodist Church did   not at that time pull out of the World Council of Churches was precisely its   commitment and understanding that the World Church has a responsibility to be   prophetic about any aspect of life. But having said that, it is with shame that   in fact we or some parts of our church felt very strongly at the time that the   World Council of Churches might have been interfering in what in their view   was not a territory they should intervene in. But that was not the official   position of our church. \nREV.",

What I want to know is what kind of witness and resistance did the Methodists   both ordained and non-ordained try to organise in the Transkei against this   unnecessary and totally dictatorial way of seizing literally both properties   and also making it impossible for the Methodist Church to pastor in that area?",

            "You will recall Sir that there were some of our ordained   ministers who refused to be part of the church that was created in Transkei   by the government of that time and a number of them suffered severely in the   hands of the State. You will also remember that the intention of the Transkei   government at the time was not merely to mobilise those ministers who at the   time were ministering in the territory of Transkei, but it sought to try and   lure back into Transkei all Methodist ministers whose birth roots were in Transkei.   And so there was a very significant resistance in the Methodist Church of Southern   Africa at the level of individuals. Officially the church organised a number   of meetings with that government to try and bring that government to its senses   on this matter to no avail. Also it would be appropriate to say here as I have   indicated in my submission some of our ministers felt that they could not leave   at that time. There were some who I would believe took the opportunity and probably   used it for their own ends, but as we were in consultations with our ministers   in the area, one of the thorny questions that used to disturb them very deeply   in their consciences, was whether they would abandon the people God had given   to them to minister to at that time. And I know a good number of ministers who   were never happy and this is why it is difficult to condemn all of them outright,   but the situation compromised all of us. It compromised those who did not go   back to Transkei as people who did not care for the spiritual lives of their   own people, it compromised those who remained in Transkei as people who did   not care for the welfare of the church Catholic, so we all came out of that   soiled. \nREV.",

I don't know whether that in itself doesn't   mark the failure of the church to provide sound moral standards to the black   people, more especially looking at the present day situation. I can't understand   why the churches don't account for just that loss and that kind of a weakness   that was characteristic of it, and this is perhaps is why they have not even   begun to tackle the issue of local community schools very strongly. That is   whether to revive them and what the obstacles can be and to open up a debate   in that direction Bishop. Can you please account for that.

            "Indeed Sir, I would agree with you entirely. There are   two aspects to this issue. First, I would like us to remember that one of the   most difficult things about apartheid was not always what apartheid made the   whites do to us, but also what apartheid made us do to ourselves. We have records   of some of the debates in our conference at the time when the government was   taking the schools from our church. And sadly, but truthfully, some of the people   who argued very strongly at the time for the church to surrender some of the   schools given the pressure that was exerted on the church, came from our black   communities and that is a very sad thing when we look back at our history and   or course, needless to say again, the white leadership at the time and again   I have indicated to you that one of the problems in the Methodist Church for   a long time was the suppression of black leadership, the white leadership at   the time turned around and said we don't believe that it's a wise move, but   who are we to say when some of the key leading black people say that maybe this   will bring education cheaper to all of their people. It is a very unfortunate   situation, but it is true that we also burnt our fingers.\nBut having said that, we should be ashamed, and we are ashamed that we did   not put up a stronger resistance to our schools being taken from us by the state.   We must confess even more our sins that at that time when we should have been   not only vigilant but also at our most creative we were not creative enough   to look at how we could have developed other alternatives to bring education   to black communities. It is one of the key areas at the moment that is occupying   us in the Methodist Church in our discussions. We took a decision a few years   ago that as part of our process of getting back to the formation of our people,   we must challenge every single Methodist Church to try and get back into early   child education and one of the most successful programmes at this point in time   of the Methodist Church is precisely that. I have now eluded in my submission   to the fact that we have called on all our churches to now start further programmes   that will help those people who were disadvantaged through education or lack   of education, to be assisted to regain those skills. Therefore in our fellowship,   we are very conscious of the great challenge for the church to get back into   some form of education again.",

But when you actually go down to the local churches you   will find these. One of the most vexing problems is the problem of a church   that has a tradition where ministers have primarily received their stipends   through the congregations they serve. Now, what we have done is to try and encourage   the breakdown of those dividing lines so that where our ministers work together   to serve our people together, those distinctions will be overcome.

            "Thank you your Grace, Chairperson. Permit me to introduce   on my left Father Buti Thlagale, who is the Secretary General of the Southern   African Bishops' Conference, representing South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland.   And I am Bishop Kevin Dowling. I come from a little place in the North West   Province, that you might know of, Rustenberg, and we are the two devils here   and we are thankful that our angels are in the audience praying for us. \nChairperson, your Grace, we in our submission today have decided to follow   the three questions which we received from the Johannesburg TRC office last   week and I will be dealing with the first two and then Father Buti will be dealing   with the last one concerning the future and recommendations. \nWe are here in the name of the Catholic Church and speaking to our document   which we submitted on August the 15th to certain issues in that document. But   when we look at ourselves as the Catholic Church in Southern Africa, in South   Africa in particular, we have to recognise that as the people of God, the Catholic   Church is peopled and will always be peopled by the full spectrum of the South   African society. And so you will find in our community in terms of political   stance, the right, even extreme right, and the left, even extreme left and everything   in between, and therefore we have to admit that we haven't had one single vision   or understanding of our society, be it political, economic or social, and we   haven't had a single unifying perspective on the issues which we have grappled   with in the struggle in the apartheid era. And this perhaps one of the crosses   we have to admit, we have to bear from the past. However, at the level of leadership,   that is the Bishop's Conference, there has been one voice, although we have   to ask, having said that, how effective that one voice has been in terms of   expressing a unified stance of the whole church community and the effect it   has had on the whole church community in terms of the development of the apartheid   struggle. \nSo to come to the first question we were asked to deal with To what extent   has your denomination suffered from apartheid in the past? We have to say in   the first instance that the Catholic Church reflected indeed the divisions of   the society in which it found itself. Just as apartheid divided people according   to colour, so did it divide the church, our church, into a black community and   a white community. There was in effect a black church and a white church. And   therefore seeing the issues of the day from that reality and perspective, it   was very much a black community affected by the discrimination, a suffering   black community and for the most part, a white more affluent community that   was to a great extent, marginalised or not aware of the reality of the apartheid   system as it was affecting the great majority of our people in this country. \n[TAPE 4]\n[inaudible] comprised in excess of 80% membership black and the rest   white and therefore to a very great extent our church mirrored the fact that   this community was, to a great extent, a suffering community. The divisions   therefore of parishes according to black and white communities compromised in   our church the gospel message of reconciliation, it also compromised a witness   of being a united community, responding to the issues of the day. There is a   saying that in terms of our relationship with the Nationalist Government, which   came to power in 1948, they targeted three main enemies of the so-called \"Volk\"   and people smile at the Afrikaans way this was expressed. There was the \"swart   gevaar\" there was the \"room se gevaar\" and there was the \"rooi   gevaar\". And in 1948 the Catholic Church was guilty on two counts, but   as time developed, we became guilty on three counts and we had to bear the brunt   of many accusations about being wolves in sheep's clothing, with the apartheid   state questioning which kingdom was being served by this church community.\nAnother effect of the apartheid system on our church community has to do with   education. Today the whole nation is reaping the very bitter fruit of the National   Party's policy of segregated education. In 1953 the hated Bantu education was   introduced and the government removed all subsidies from the Catholic Church   Mission Schools, so as to exercise a form of social control. At that time, the   church was deeply involved in education and was to pay a very high price for   its opposition to this act. In 1953 the Catholic Church ran 688 state aided   schools, and 130 unaided schools and that represented roughly 15% of all schools   for black learners. Twenty years later in 1973, after many confrontations and   struggles there were only 367 schools left. The Bishops in response to the withdrawal   of the subsidy mounted a campaign to try and provide for financial support to   these schools from our own resources. It was a very difficult and painful struggle   and in the end we had to admit we failed because it was too great a task and   the whole quality of education began to fail. So this affected not only our   church but also the advancement of black people through education in which we   were involved. The same picture is mirrored in terms of our Catholic hospitals   and clinics and the other institutions and associations which followed the same   path. \nThe growing commitment to justice within the church demanded a high price.   I'll come back to this. But just to cite a couple of things. Archbishop Hurley,   as President of the Southern African Catholics Bishops' Conference and Father   Smangaliso Mkatshwa had to appear in court. The Conference headquarters, Khanya   House, was fire bombed some six weeks after Khotso House by the security police.   Many priests were imprisoned and exiled or deported. Many of our church workers   were detained for long periods. Religious communities were targeted, Bishops   and leaders harassed, houses searched, documents seized and so on. We were part   of the suffering community. But when we move now to what did the church as a   community do in the struggle against or how did it support apartheid in the   past. \nFirstly, we came (our church community) out of a context of a struggle to survival   in what was basically a hostile context. This from last century. And we viewed   with great alarm the rise to power of the nationalist government in 1948. Our   conference, the Bishops' Conference was established in 1947 but even before   then some of the bishops began to see the danger lurking in the apartheid system   which was coming in. For example in 1939, Bishop Henneman of Cape Town said   \"In accordance with the spirit of solicitude which the Catholic Church   has always shown for the moral and material welfare of the people, I feel it   incumbent upon me to condemn any segregation on the grounds of race or colour.   Any attempt therefore to introduce legislation based purely on race or colour   must be opposed and condemned unjust\". That was in 1939. But from 1947   when the Conference was established, the Bishops sought to speak as a Conference   on the issues of the day and they began to attach the false theological base   on which the ideology of apartheid was based. In 1951 one of the first Conference   statements condemned racial discrimination but didn't use the word apartheid,   but here we see the fact that we were a church community of the day. We reflected   the way issues were looked at in that day. For example, it reflected a paternalistic   spirit, the statement in 1952, maintaining that most non-Europeans (was the   word commonly used at the time) were not yet ready for full participation in   the social, political and economic life of the country, but must be allowed   and encouraged to evolve towards such participation. That was an early statement,   but by 1957, the Conference had begun to focus much more critically and it in   1957 called apartheid what it really is intrinsically evil.\nStatement after statement followed which focused on abuses by the state, on   current issues and it also took on an increasingly prophetic stance by the Conference   in terms of the evolving situation. Also it revealed an evolving more democratic   process in the way these statements were arrived at. We developed new ways of   listening to our suffering majority through consultations, study days, draft   documents which invited comments, and then the Bishops made the statement. But   we must ask All these many statements over the years - what was their effect?   They were directed primarily as pastoral statements at the people within the   church community. As the Bishops tried to help the ordinary people, especially   the white community to understand what was happening in the country and how   to cope with this in the context of their faith. But even there we had to cope   with conservative and right wing groups in our own Catholic Church community,   for example the Catholic Defence League and the group called Tradition, Family   and Property, which not only fiercely contested the Bishop's statements but   in every way objected to them and were not part of them. \nHowever, the Catholic Church, we would say, failed to live up to the principles   of its gospel faith. Not so much by failing to proclaim them, but by proving   inadequate in communicating them successfully to its church community and to   encourage and empower them to live by those gospel values, particularly the   white community. It was a difficult task because really it required a conversion   process in the full theological and spiritual meaning of that term and the average   white church member in particular needed quite a degree of heroism and experience   of the black reality to live up to the demands of the gospel in the face of   the apartheid juggernaught. People considered their families, jobs and so forth.   It needed courage. The critical and condemnatory statements which were issued   against the government were not spoken directly to the electorate in terms of   trying to produce change (the white electorate) but to the government. And of   course the government took no notice of them at all. And so looking at our long   list of statements, we could say that our pastoral statements came from a minority   church and reached only a minority in South Africa. There are also expressions   of solidarity, especially during the years of extreme repression during the   eighties during the ...[inaudible] sessions each year. We went as a body to   celebrate eucharist with communities that had suffered gravely. For example   Sebokeng, Mamelodi, Soweto and Sosangule. We also paid a visit to that infamous   electric fence to expose its horrors and to celebrate eucharist with the Mozambican   refugees in their camp. We used vigils, processions and other services to help   people pray through their distress and also as a means of ...[indistinct] people.   And our church buildings took on new meanings as places of refuge, sanctuary   and truth for suffering people, for example Regina Mundi Church. Through our   YCW movement, we promoted and tried to help young black workers to reflect on   the interaction between their lives as workers and their lives as christian   believers using the \"See, judge, act\" method.\nOther ways we tried to struggle We involved ourselves in investigations and   exposing the role of the South African Defence Force in human rights violations   in Namibia, in particular the Koevoet Battalion. We started and sponsored the   New Nation Newspaper, as a means of allowing the voice of the oppressed people   to be heard. The Bishops endorsed and supported the standing for the truth campaign.   Our church halls and other institutions were made available to the people's   organisations in resistance to apartheid. We tried to give those on the run   from the security forces sanctuary, refuge. We used also our international Catholic   structures to expose world-wide what was going on in South Africa. International   funding for development projects and anti-apartheid activities was channelled   through our Bishops' Conference. But then we also began to reflect upon our   own internal structures. For example, we ran segregated seminaries for the training   of our priests and pastors. We saw the need for radical change in order to be   effective witnesses in society. So in 1976, we began the process in which we   opened in the face of tremendous opposition, our Catholic Schools to all races.   Perhaps one of the moves of our church, maybe bold at that time, was to openly   support the Black Consciousness Movement. But however much we tried to do, we   have to recognise with humility and sorrow that we could have done a lot more   and in conclusion to this section, I would just like to basically sum up the   stance of our church in terms of what this hearing is all about.\nThere were times when, as a church, we were deaf to the cry of the poor. There   were times when we were blind to the limitations of our own practices. Times   when we were more concerned for ourselves as an institution rather than as servants   of God's people. Times when we turned a blind eye to evil, when we remained   silent. Times when we were more concerned with not having ex-patriots deported,   than with drawing attention to the wrongs done. And silence, in the face of   ongoing and systematically oppression at all levels, is perhaps our greatest   failure. And so in conclusion, I would just like to use the words our church   community and our Bishop's Conference issued after the Rustenberg Conference \n\"The declaration issued by the Rustenberg Conference has led us with considerable   pain to examine our own history. We recognise that its message applies to our   church as a corporate body. We must admit with sorrow that although as a church   we have often spoken out against the sin of apartheid we are not innocent of   all complicity in supporting or going along with it. So we ask forgiveness from   all those, both within the church and beyond who have suffered from our actions,   blindness and negligence in the past. We reaffirm our commitment to remove all   vestiges of apartheid in our institutions and procedures\"\nAnd now as we move into where we go to in the future, I would ask Father Buti   Thalgale to continue.",

            "Perhaps before one makes some comments on the way forward,   just to raise a number of concerns or issues that puzzled us. \nThere's certainly a concern with the political expediency that gave rise to   this process of the Truth and Reconciliation. We admit that we cannot undo history   or the political comprises that were made in order to achieve a settlement.   There is, however, a concern that the victims may have been asked to sacrifice   individual justice for truth. We see that many victims not only had to sacrifice   justice in that sense but also the truth, for example there are people who still   don't know who killed their loved ones, where the body of their loved one is,   or who is responsible. Justice and truth, in a sense one can argue, have been   sacrificed for reconciliation. We are concerned that some of the perpetrators   of gross human rights violations do not take personal responsibility for their   actions, but keep on referring to their superiors. We can legitimately say that   we are angry that some political parties and leaders of the day have not taken   responsibility for the abuses which took place. \nFinally, we are concerned that the perpetrators, upon receiving amnesty, are   not always willing to make reparations personally. Indeed while the commission   might have a short life span, we are also concerned as to how this process will   evolve after this. The Catholic Church is committed to promoting the principle   of mutual acceptance and mutual recognition. Political arrangements by the State   may cater for this, but the State is not necessarily in a position to enforce   mutual acceptance and the respect for persons. And so faith communities could   cultivate the need to actively, visibly and consistently promote the spirit   of reconciliation. \nAt the same time, we do ask ourselves about the very word we use reconciliation.   In our Catholic understanding of our own history, we rather call for a confession   and forgiveness and restitution. The Catholic Church is committed to promoting   rituals of reconciliation and to celebrate in those rituals publicly and in   so doing will seek the collaboration of the other faith communities. It seems   as a practical level there will be a need to identify appropriate public holidays,   religious and cultural events, during which these rituals can be celebrated.   There is need to bring people from diverse cultural backgrounds together if   we are going to achieve this goal of nation building. Furthermore, reconciliation   is not only between the victims and perpetrators, but also between the communities.   In this regard it seems desirable that there ought to be a body after the demise   of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that will co-ordinate the work of   promoting reconciliation and perhaps solicit funding from interested parties   such as the business sector. \nSuch a process, we think, could then evolve a national calendar dedicated to   promoting peace and reconciliation. The Catholic Church is committed to supporting   efforts by government local authorities, non-governmental organisations and   community initiatives to promoting peaceful co-existence and good neighbourliness.   The Catholic Church on its part will urge and encourage leaders of different   faith communities and work together with them. And leaders of the various communities   who will be seen to be publicly working together for the common goal. \nThere's fear that activities with regard to reconciliation in the post TRC   era might be left to chance. And therefore the church suggests that indeed there   ought to be a process put in place that will take care of this. ...[inaudible]   lobby the national government, business sector, unions and communities for symbolic   gestures of reconciliation. In particular, the Catholic Church recommends the   building of a memorial in the name of all those, all who lost their lives in   the struggle for freedom. We are aware that the reparation committee might have   a long list of these suggestions, but we think that the erection of a national   shrine to the unknown comrades, for example, or public event that will draw   people from diverse backgrounds together to celebrate this reconciliation will   go a long way towards creating a peaceful atmosphere. We further recommend that   in a symbolic fashion, it is still a desirable activity to have symbolic re-burials   of some of the people in South Africa who died or who were killed in exile. \nFinally, while we recognise that these will contribute towards the spirit of   reconciliation, we firmly believe that the crux of true reconciliation can only   come about through the creation of a fair and just economic system in which   ordinary people can live without fear in their homes, enjoy employment opportunities   and take care of their families. This has been the desire of the majority of   the oppressed people. We also believe that in attending to these, we will be   attending to a component of the kingdom of God on earth.",

Certainly as I hinted at in my part of the submission what require   for the ...[indistinct] group in terms of the realities of South Africa is a   true conversion process and that takes time and not only that, but it also takes   ongoing and really deep exposure to the realities of the oppressed majority   of this country. \nFor example even in terms of myself as a white South African, and this would   explain the kind of reality that I am talking about. I grew up in Pretoria.   Even as part of our Catholic Church community I used to visit the townships   as a young church worker, but that did not impinge on my heart and spirit in   terms of shocking me into the harsh reality of what apartheid was doing. I left   the country at the age of 17 to go to England to study, then I came back and   at the age of 26 I was posted to the townships in Cape Town. And it was then   that for the first time in my journey as a christian that I came to experience   firsthand in sense of it touching my being, what was happening, what was being   done to people. I began to at least partially appreciate the realities of the   apartheid system as it affected the oppressed majority by seeing through the   eyes of oppressed people and listening through their ears and therefore taking   on a whole other perspective. That was a conversion process which brought me,   in terms of joining the christian institute in those days in Cape Town, and   an increasing stance for justice. That was a whole conversion process that I   went through simply because I as a white South African was exposed and experienced   firsthand reality, not cut off from it, but with the people and it was they   who evangelised me and therefore brought about that.\nNow how one translates a conversion process like that (this is my personal   view) in terms of whole communities or sections of communities if precisely   the challenge facing us. As we said, and as Father Buti has already said, we   are committed as a church to find a way to reconcile ourselves as a community   and to go a lot further than where we are at the moment. We've got to find creative   ways to bring people together in terms of understanding each other and above   all, understanding what the past has done and how we were involved in that past,   especially through our silence and especially through not standing. But the   whole church community requires reconciliation as part of the wider community   in South Africa and we've got to find the ways to that conversion process.",

It is not left just to a local church community and the policy as Father   Buti has already said, has been decided upon at the moment from our structures   in Rome, because that is the way our particular structures in terms of decision   making and coming to policy directions, that is the way it is done.\nWe recognise, we have heard the voices you refer to.

How we take it forward is part of the ongoing debate within the international   Catholic Church community. The present way, as I said, this will be resolved   is through that international community coming through discernment to a position   where either the Pope with the Bishops, or the Pope himself in terms of a decision   will make such a decision for the universal church.

One, that he belongs   to a generation thathe is of the generation to which the present and the   future belongs, whereas I belong to the generation that is passe. And   secondly, because as he put it, \"You as a white Presbyterian have much   more to confess for white Presbyterians than I do as a black Presbyterian!\"\nBut I would like to point out, Mr Chairperson, that he is the man who is wearing   the gold socks, if you are able to see underneath the table! Let me say that   everything that I will now say is qualified by the recognition which we all   have that the witness of the Presbyterian Church, like the witness of all the   mainline churches against Apartheid, was weakened by internal dissent, lacked   appropriate outrage and vigour, and apart from a few things, failed to move   beyond mere protest to action. At the same time, it is also true, that like   the other mainline churches there are, we did make a stand to some extent for   justice. Although we may now very much wish that it had been far more resolute   and heroic. \nWhen our church was formed in 1897, it was the bringing together of a number   of white congregations and Presbyteries, with some of the congregations and   Presbyteries of the Scottish Mission Churches. That led to the fact that we   actually started off as a church that was to some extent separately organised   in that for a long time the Presbyterian Native Missions Committee supervised   the black congregation. Sometime before 1940, the name of this was changed to   African Missions Committee, but it still remained a somewhat paternalistic way   of doing things and only ended in 1962/3. Even then, congregations continued   to be racially designated until 1970. On the other hand, from the very beginning,   all regional courts in the Presbyterian Church of South Africa have always been   fully integrated and in principal all congregations have always been open to   all races. We hesitated for a long time to elect black leaders, partly because   of this way of running things and one of the causes for shame, really, in our   church is that such an outstanding black leader in the Presbyterian Church as   George B. Molefe, who was a very prominent educationalist and community leader   in Port Elizabeth, was elected only to be Moderator of the Presbytery of Port   Elizabeth and never succeeded in Moderator of the General Assembly, which is   the denominational Synod. The first black Moderator of the General Assembly   was elected only in 1972, to serve in 1973/4 and he was Dr. James R. Jolobe,   a prominent Xhosa writer and poet. He was incidentally, originally a member   of the so-called, of what was then the Bantu Presbyterian Church. \nWe have recently elected the seventh black Moderator of the Assembly and he   is a black lay-person, a Professor at Umtata. Economically the PCSA has remained   a church in which there is a great deal of discrimination in the payment of   its ministers. The Assembly sets minimum stipends, but unlike the Anglican church   for instance, each congregation pays its own ministers, except that those ministers   whose stipends fall under the minimum are assisted from central funds. As most   black congregations though much larger are much poorer than white congregations,   many black ministers are on the minimum stipend or close to it. By the early   1960's in some qualification of that, it had at least been ruled by the church   (SIDE TWO) [inaudible] even whether the ministers had contributed or not.   Because in some of the black congregations, they could not contribute. But it   remains true that this was the system and only in 1981 was there a move actually   to implement the principle of equal stipends. The next year, however, the whole   idea was dropped, partly because no black Commissioner would stand up and support   it. One must therefore recognise that to some extent that education and certainly   the money and the majority factor, because whites have always been the majority   in the Presbyterian Church of South and later Southern Africa, led to basically   white control in the denomination. Now, before 1948, as far as protests against   racial injustice are concerned, I think we have to confess that the Presbyterian   Church of South Africa as it was then, was really more concerned with issues   like temperance and Sunday observance, than racial injustice as it purports   to the Assemblies and Assembly resolutions. Nevertheless, in 1941, the Assembly   did appoint a committee to contact other churches to draw up a joint statement   calling for a reconstruction of the social order based more fully upon the moral   principles of the Christian religion and to present this to the government.   And made other statements as well. In 1948 of course, when the white electorate   elected to government the National Party with its more crudely racist platform   of apartheid, this provoked the Presbyterian Church to more frequent, more outspoken   criticisms of the racial situation beginning, let's say in 1949 by supporting   the statement of the Christian Council of South Africa opposing Apartheid and   in 1950 with the attacking of the disenfranchisement of the coloured voters.   Various assemblies appointed took fairly strong protests against various bills   and policies of the government, but I don't want to go into that too much because   as Bishop Dowling said in the previous submission, the government didn't really   take notice of that and in any case, I would add, it to some extent served as   a kind of sock to the conscience of the church as well as to the conscience   of its members and in a sense almost strengthened the government because the   church was doing nothing. The church at this stage, never thought of moving   from the comfort zone of such statements of protest to the more difficult and   costly path of action. For instance, there was no thought of joining the early   demonstrations against apartheid, like the defiance campaign in 1953. The leaders   of the church were white and conservative and they would have seen that as dirtying   the church's hand with too direct a hand in politics. But there was one man,   one Presbyterian minister who wished to go further, in particular that I want   to mention, perhaps particularly because this was in this very city of East   London. Under the impact of apartheid legislation after 1948, only a very few   integrated congregations survived in South Africa, and nearly all of these were   in the Anglican and Catholic Cathedrals in the large cities, and even in some   of those the races sat separately. But Rob Robertson, the minister in this,   at that time very conservative city, resolved to start a congregation that would   specifically seek to be a congregation bringing into fellowship across the racial   divide white and black and rich and poor. And so he resigned his post in the   church that he had here, and started a new congregation in the poor and still   racially mixed suburb of North End, in 1962. Dr Dawid Venter, sociologist in   the Dutch Reformed Church, and an academic, has said in a thesis that he has   written on this, that this was the first deliberate move by any denomination   to establish an integrated congregation and so reverse the whole trend towards   greater segregation that had been underway for so long. This project received   a lot of support from the denomination but unfortunately there was not enough   support for it in East London and eventually in 1970 the members of the congregation   decided to close down the congregation and joined other congregations in East   London in order to make them multiracial. In 1975 Rob Robertson moved to Pageview,   Johannesburg, to run a similar congregation there, St Anthony's, and that was   to become a spiritual base for christian activists against apartheid and for   objectors to military conscription. \nFrom 1968, and particularly from 1979 onwards, the criticisms of apartheid   made by the General Assembly became sharper and sharper. In 1970, also, I need   to mention that the Presbyterian Church came under tremendous pressure because   it was the first church that had to decide its response to the programme to   combat racism grants. And the government brought great pressure not only on   the churches in general, but particularly on the Presbyterian Church precisely   because it was the first one that had to make the decision. To the extent that   Mr B.J. Vorster actually invited the incumbent moderator and the previous moderator   to go and have dinner with him, where he treated them to a great meal and also   some alcohol, in the hope that this would soften things up. And one of those   ex-moderators actually led the debate to leave the World Council, but in the   end what happened was that the Presbyterian Church, although it decided to cancel   its subscription, and we can't really use the excuse that the government had   said that it would not allow any money to go to the World Council anymore, because   I think most of those present actually felt that they wanted to do this, but   it did at least take a swipe at the government that was harder than that of   its criticism of the WCC and it also said that it wanted to invite, it extended   an invitation to the WCC to send people out to explain its point of view on   this. In 1973 the Assembly invited all sessions to display a notice outside   their churches that people of all races were welcome to all services, and in   1977, that was interpreted as a directive. In 1973, the Assembly took a step   further in its opposition to apartheid by approving the declaration of faith   for our church today. But the whole reaction of the church to that was fairly   typical, because there was an attempt to make this an official confession faith,   or declaration of faith by the church. And out of its conservatism, feeling   that it already had a declaration of faith, a confession of faith, Presbyterian   confession of faith, there was resistance to this until thirteen years later.   Partly as a result of the fact that this was now being used by Presbyterian   churches overseas. This was actually made an official confession of faith of   the church and so the Presbyterian Church became the only church besides the   Dutch Reformed Mission Church, with its Belhar Confession in 1982, to adopt   a confessional statement against apartheid, and in that sense officially declare   that apartheid was a hierarchy, because this was a statement against the kind   of pietism which tries to separate faith from politics by emphasising the lordship   of Christ over the political area and also by emphasising the fact that the   gospel opposed apartheid.\nAnother important Presbyterian document against apartheid was drawn up in 1979.   That year, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches organised a conference for   all its member churches in South Africa on the \"Church and Social Responsibility   in South Africa\" and the Dutch Reformed Church sent out to all the delegates   its official memorandum for the conference as its official memorandum, copies   of its report adopted in 1975, the so-called Landman Report, \"Ras, Volk   en Nasie en Volkere Verhouderinge in die Lig van die Skrif\" which had a   much more innocuous title of \"Human Relations and the South African Scene   in the Light of Scripture\". Well, what happened then was that I as one   of the delegates to the Conference drew up a statement which examined the whole   basis of this document and was then officially endorsed by the Executive Commission   acting on behalf of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, and so   it became an official church document that was presented to the conference.   It caused consternation and great anger amongst the Afrikaans Reformed Church   delegates, but in the end, partly because it was a bit controversial, or very   controversial amongst some sections, the conference decided to focus on practical   issues instead of facing the underlining theological differences and so got   nowhere. This was published in 1979, that same year, in a revised form with   a title, \"A different Gospel - A critique of the Theology behind Apartheid\"   and distributed to all ministers to study. It was the first and indeed the only   published in-depth examination and debunking of the biblical ...[inaudible]   with which the Afrikaans Reformed Churches for so long sought to justify their   support for apartheid. And it was used as the basic document by Dr Alan Boesak   and others when the General Council of the World Alliance Reformed Churches   met in Ottoway in 1982, to get that body to declare apartheid as a hierarchy,   or the theological justification as a hierarchy. Pierre Rossouw, the ecumenical   officer of the Dutch Reformed Church also later admitted that it had played   a significant part in moving the Dutch Reformed Church away from that Landman   statement to its later formulation called \"Kerk en samelewing\" which   for all its faults, did at least recognise that the apartheid ideology was a   mistake. \nIn 1979, the Assembly took a very strong stand against the information department   scandal. One of the interesting things that happened was that the business committee   of the Assembly and the General Secretary at the time refused to print some   of the proposed resolutions because it was afraid of government action and asked   the convenor of the committee please to reformulate them. He refused, however,   and the Assembly supported him by voting in favour of all of those proposals.   But I think that the basic issue that the churches had to face, and this was   recognised by some of us, was at that we had to move off the safe ground of   statements or fairly safe ground of statements, into the area of action. And   that was why we began to think a great deal about the issue of military service   and conscientious objection. Because so long as christians in our churches protested   against apartheid, but still were willing to serve in the police or especially   in the defence force, which was there to back up the police by its presence,   by its threat of force and by its use of force and still keep the political   status quo in place, nothing would change. So in 1971 and repeatedly thereafter,   it was proposed to the General Assembly that it should support the right of   conscientious objectors on political grounds, that is on so-called Just War   doctrine, as well as on passive grounds. And in 1973 it called on congregations   to pray not only for servicemen but also for those fighting on the side of the   liberation fronts. In 1974, occurred the Hamanskraal Resolution, at the annual   national conference of the SAC, which was proposed by myself as a Presbyterian   delegate and seconded by Dominee Beyers Naude, that was fought tooth and nail   by very prominent members of other churches represented here, whom I will not   name now, and in fact was not supported at all by the General Secretary of the   SACC, even though Bregalia Bam has mentioned this as a resolution of the SACC,   because John Reece was very unhappy about it and blocked communication between   us and the newspapers, so that they could not get much copy. This caused an   uproar in the Afrikaans newspapers particularly, and the government reacted   very sharply and B.J. Vorster saw that they quickly passed a special law that   any person who used any language or does any act or anything with intent to   recommend, encourage, aid, incite, instigate, suggest or otherwise cause any   other person to refuse or fail to render any military service (that sounds typically   Nationalist Party Government) [intervention]",

            "Well, we started at half past, but let me continue then. \nThe next year I tried to pursue this matter further, but John Reece and the   staff of the SACC actually blocked that. The PCSA itself never took a radical   enough stance on the issue of military service, but it did regularly pay special   tribute to people like Peter Mar, Richard Steel and other conscientious objectors   as courageous confessors of the faith and in 1982 approved a document to be   distributed to all congregations to help members of congregations rethink the   whole issue of conscientious objection and in 1990 did the same with another   document called \"The different approaches to the ethics of war and conscientious   objection\". That year it also adopted the following motion \n\"The Assembly expresses repentance that our church failed to make a clear   strong stand long ago in favour of conscientious objection to serving in an   army that was used to defend the apartheid system by military threat and action\".\nIt also came very close, not only to refusing to appoint further military chaplains,   like the Anglican Church, but also to withdraw all its military chaplains and   adopted a motion that we should appoint chaplains if possible, to the liberation   forces of the ANC and PAC and actually met with those bodies in Harare, and   I understand was the only body to do that in order to try and arrange that,   although nothing came of it. Let me just say that, let me just quickly end by   saying in 1981 the General Assembly moved quite specifically off the base of   protest to action by voting to defy the government on three issues. One was   the prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, by calling on its ministers to marry   across the racial line. The second was the Group Areas and Urban Areas Act,   by supporting any ministers who chose to live near their congregations in the   other racial area in defiance of the act, or other racial areas, and thirdly   by defying the government on the banning of people like Beyers Naude and banned   political literature by encouraging ministers to quote them, deliberately quote   them from pulpits when this was relevant. This made the Presbyterian Church   the first church in South African, apart from the defiance of the proposed church   clause by the Church of the Province that Archbishop Clayton threatened in 1957,   officially to espouse the principle of act of civil disobedience and this was   quite a costly decision because we lost several congregations as a result of   that. But several other churches came out in support of the Presbyterian Church   then as far as the Mixed Marriages Act was concerned. I think I'll end there   except just to say this that in 1990 the Assembly hailed the promise of a new   democratic and more just constitution for South Africa and on behalf of the   Presbyterian Church, expressed repentance for all the many ways in which we   as Presbyterians have collaborated or compromised with the apartheid system   and failed to stand against it with enough prayer, courage, determination and   self-sacrifice and instructed that a short liturgy of confession along these   lines should be distributed to all congregations in South Africa for use at   special services of repentance on Soweto Day.",

To save time I'm not going to   go through some of the steps that we have in answering question number three,   because that would be repetition as they have already been mentioned and we   share the same sentiments as other denominations, English speaking denominations,   that have given some principles insofar as how we can tackle the future. But   I'm just going to highlight a few. We support what has been said this morning   that churches need, and other faith communities, need to have their own TRC   within their church, making confession before God and those who suffered, both   black and white by telling and listening to one another's stories and forgiving   one another as Christ has forgiven us. This is one thing that we think for us   to address the future and make reconciliation a reality, that we need to tackle.   And one of the challenges that we think faces not only the PCSA and other faith   communities, is the war against poverty. We think we shall wage a war against   the abject poverty which is so obvious in our country and we think it shall   be our task, because some of the business people are our congregants, to convince   them that the wealth that they have accumulated during the apartheid era, it's   time that they should show repentance, and bring it back so that it can be used   to address this abject poverty that has engulfed our country. The PCSA and the   Reformed Presbyterian Church, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the UCSA   need to accept the challenge that has been put to the Dutch Reformed Church   and the three sister churches of other races to unite. It is therefore to be   welcomed that soon after the first democratic elections in South Africa in 1994,   the Reformed Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa's   Assemblies agreed to reopen negotiations for union. We thank you for the opportunity,   Sir, your invitation that has given us a time to reflect on the past, to rejoice   in the positive things which were done to oppose apartheid and to guard against   gross human rights violations and also to look at ourselves in the light of   the gospel of Jesus Christ and to say to all who suffered in any form whatsoever   as a result of apartheid and whose suffering could have been lessened had we,   as the PCSA and other faith communities been more faithful to the demands of   the gospel We are sorry and will endeavour by God's grace to be more faithful   in word and deed.

            "The reason why we have several Presbyterian Churches in this   country is firstly because there were missions from different countries. There   was a mission or two missions from two different churches, two different Scottish   churches, in what is now called the Eastern Cape. There was a mission from a   Swiss Church in the Northern Transvaal and there was a mission from the Paris   Evangelical in Lesotho. And then there was a breakaway fromwell let me   first of all say when the Presbyterian Church of South Africa was formed in   1897 there was an attempt to include all the congregations that did subsequently   join that church, plus all the Scottish missions, but some of the Scottish missions   - one of the Scottish missions, particularly that of the Free Church of Scotland   decided to stay out, largely to stay out, and then in 1921 or 1920 rather, some   missionaries were sent out to look at the whole issue and they made a recommendation   that it would be better if the black congregations first of all formed a church   on their own that would much later join up with the white congregation, with   the Presbyterian Church of South Africa. So in 1923 what was called the Bantu   Presbyterian Church formed, and because the Presbyterian Church of South Africa   at that stage was asked if it would release some of its black congregations   to join that church, it gave them the option to do so, which many of them did.   Some of them subsequently came back. For a long time the Assemblies of the two   churches had representatives from each other present at all their meetings and   the idea always was that eventually they would join up. There have been attempts   to unite those two churches and what is now called the Evangelical Reformed   Church which is the church in the Northern Transvaal, but these have failed.   Partly because of the making the Transkei independent which aroused quite a   feeling of nationalism amongst many people in the Transkei and made people in   the Reformed Presbyterian Churches that subsequently became a bit hesitant to   join us. Partly because I think of the experience of white paternalism in the   PCSA. We hope now that things will move ahead. We have tried in the past and   the attempts to unite have always failed.\nREV.",

I'm also very grateful that Professor John   de Guchi is here to assist me where my faith falls short. In case I overrun,   let me begin with the end, if I may Sir, and say what our confession is. Like   many of the other churches today, with the benefit of hindsight we need to be   honest with ourselves and with the country and confess that for all our statements,   sermons and letters and reports about the evils of apartheid, we really did   so little to rid our beloved land of its tyranny. We did so little to bind up   the wounds of those who were victims of the system and to labour with them for   justice. We so often relied on the one or two who were willing to stick their   necks out and as a people we were scared and anxious to be bold and prophet   witness. And so we apologise to those whom we abandoned in their difficult plight   and to the nation for failing in our moral responsibility.\nWe knew all along that hideous things were happening, and that is often why   we said what we said, and did what we did. We recognise that what is being revealed   by your commission will have a profound impact on future generations in the   country. There are sins to be forgiven, wounds to be bound up, hatreds to be   reconciled, buildings to be re-built, pupils to be taught, leaders to be held   accountable and this is the task of the church of Jesus Christ. And although   we are a small church with few resources, we acknowledge this calling and commit   ourselves to nurturing this truth, healing the nation and building a culture   of tolerance and justice, so that our children and their children may never   again suffer the evil which has so plagued the life of our nation. How, Sir,   did we get there? We are numbered among the English speaking churches, although   I think the predominant language in our church is Afrikaans, probably the second   most common language in our church is Zulu, followed by Tswana. But we prepare   to celebrate 200 years of congregationalism in South Africa in 1999, when we   mark the arrival of the first London Missionary Society missionaries in Cape   Town. And although one can criticise the strategy and actions of many of the   missionaries in our country that came from overseas, I think they all understood   something of what Dr John Phillip, the first supervisory representative of the   LMS meant when he said, \"If a minister is guilty of dereliction of his   duty and advocating the cause of the oppressed or in relieving the necessities   of the destitute, I plead guilty to that charge\". And I think many of our   ministers in the United Congregational Church would echo those words of Phillip.   Phillip was the precursor of a long line of missionary heroes, such as Robert   Moffat, Newton Adams after whom Adams College was named, Alden Grout after whom   the town of Kwa Zulu Natal was named, David Livingstone, John MacAud, and in   our time, of our own memory, the Reverend Joseph Wing whose statements form   a large part of our submission.\nWe are glad to number among the congregational heroes of our faith many prominent   people. In fact it was the first president of the ANC, the congregational minister   Reverend John Dube who helped to address the questions then arising in 1912,   and he then, even then, charged that christianity had an offensive smell to   a large number of natives, as people of colour were then known. And with the   greatest love and respect for you, Sir, and your achievements as a Nobel Peace   Prize winner, we are proud to claim that the first Nobel Peace Prize winner   was a Congregationalist, Chief Albert Luthuli, and this year [APPLAUSE] when   the church established a Roll of Honour, his was the first name to be enrolled.   But like many of the other denominations that have been present here, Sir, we   must acknowledge that although resolutions were taken at Executive Assembly   level and statements issued by our Secretariat after hours of debating, these   were very often the positions of the leadership, and they were not embraced   by the average occupant of the pew in the white churches of our denomination.   I recall a time when I was a minister in Uitenhage and you, Sir, had done something   that had particularly offended the authorities of the day and I said from the   pulpit that the day would come when people of South Africa would be grateful   for people like Bishop Tutu and later in that week I was visited by two of my   deacons, who advised me against making such inflammatory statements from the   pulpit. But I praise you for your consistency, Sir, because when you advised   or called upon the ANC to suspend the armed struggle, you were then the flavour   of the month in Uitenhage and I could smile in the pulpit once again.\nBut from the beginning we took the position that apartheid was not simply wrong   and evil in terms of its results, but of itself, and we were early in the decision   after the Presbyterians, to embrace the Ottowa Declaration that apartheid is   a sin and its theological justification a hierarchy. And for those from the   reformed tradition to label anything a hierarchy in the calvanist understanding   of it, gives you some idea of how earnestly we took the opposition to apartheid.   Like many of the other churches we were a trans-natioanl church and some of   the victims of apartheid were in neighbouring countries. Our church life in   Mozambique was devastated by the civil war initiated by Renamo. Zimbabwe suffered   terribly through a civil war in which the white minority government of Ian Smith   received moral support from the apartheid regime. Namibia was held as a vassal   state and Botswana suffered greatly from cross border raids. Besides the violence   and destruction of a policy, our churches suffered. Our church in Graaff Reinet   was just one example to which I will refer later, of many congregations that   had to be uprooted. And Joe Wing, our General Secretary for the first 20 years   of our life, said in 1987 that it is the ultimate ...[indistinct] to designate   God's green and brown earth as black or coloured or white land. We lost many   of our institutions, like Tiger Kloof, which count among their illumine the   first two presidents of Botswana, and we share with the pain of other churches   in the trauma of the closing of the Federal Theological Seminary which still   resounds on our church life today.\nThe advent of the tricameral parliamentary system was particularly hurtful   for the Congregational Church, Sir. Two of our ministers, former chairman in   fact, the Reverend Allan Hendrikse and Andrew Julies, led the Labour Party into   accepting rolls in the House of Representatives. But the UCCSA Assembly moved   swiftly to distance itself from that and in fact that difficulty persists. Just   this very year, two months ago, the Assembly had to resolve that in the interim,   until we can do it constitutionally, ministers of the UCCSA should not contest   elections or accept political appointments at any level. The opposition to the   apartheid regime and particularly something that has already been touched on,   the programme to combat racism, we never in the UCCSA questioned the rightness   of that, even though it cost us our mother church, the Union Church in Kloof   Street, which left the United Congregational Church because of our support of   this programme to combat racism. And that schism still remains and is hurtful   to many in our denomination today. We encouraged our ministers to oppose the   Mixed Marriages Act and encouraged the registration of children without reference   to their racial classification. The Congregational Church has a long tradition   of passivism and so from the start, it was in the forefront of its opposition   to conscription and support for the End Conscription Campaign. The UCSA was   the only church to make a clear and unambiguous stand in favour of the Kyros   Document which was produced amidst the horror of the 1985 State of Emergency.   And throughout we have remained mindful of the fact that we had to challenge   the laws and policies of apartheid, while at the same time trying to minister   to its victims. \nAnd so, we must admit Sir, with the other churches, that it is to our shame   that the UCCSA in many places mirrored the apartheid society of the church.   We are not unmindful of the fact that there was something hypocritical about   condemning apartheid in the State and yet being a racially divided church in   ourselves. Resolution after resolution was passed, church programmes were introduced   to enable black, white and coloured member churches to be integrated, but with   little success. Even attempts to move ministers and to cross cultural and racial   settings were not produced with vigour. If I may end, Sir, by going back to   the reference I made to the Graaff Reinet church. In 1993 the UCCSA held its   Assembly in Graaff Reinet, and after that I wrote and broadcast on the SABC   and subsequently incorporated into a book of meditations that I published on   behalf of my local church, during which we had this to say \n\"During October 1993, in Graaff Reinet, we met to consider the affairs   of the church, and the one irony that we could not escape was the fact that   we were meeting in the Parsonage Street Congregational Church, which is no longer   situated in Parsonage Street. You see, some twenty odd years ago, the authorities   of the day decided that the good christian folk of that church were of the wrong   racial group to be worshipping slap bang in the middle of the white part of   town. They were forced to leave the historic old church building which is today   used as a theatre. And they had to move under the Group Areas Act to the more   politically acceptable coloured part of town..\" \nAnd this story can be repeated a thousand times over in South Africa. The challenge   facing this committee and our country in the future is how we go about unscrambling   our segregationist omlet and we don't know how to do it. We don't know yet fully   how to go about restoring justness and wholeness to this land, ravaged for so   long by the false gods of race and creed. Not many white South Africans feel   particularly responsible for the collective sins of our apartheid past, but   each of us, of whatever race group who have been part of the privileged class,   have made individual slights or hurts for which we do need to feel utter regret.   Even after showing our repentance by some form of righting past wrongs, many   of us will still go on making the same racial mistakes. How will we repair the   damage? Listen to God speaking to the Old Testament Prophet Joel \"I will   restore the years that the locust has eaten and you shall eat your fill\".   And then note what St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians \"From the first to   the last, this has been the work of God. He has reconciled himself to us through   Jesus Christ.\" \nAnd so to end Sir, I suggest that the way forward for every individual and   for the nation as a whole is to allow God, who has broken down the dividing   walls in Jesus Christ, is to come into our lives, our personal decisions, our   national choices. To enable the process of reconciliation and of new beginnings   to happen. He has welcomed us back to God's side, and Christ wants to restore   the years that the locust has eaten, and I wrote, \"So, Reverend Hufkey   and your congregation in Graaff Reinet, this is my personal sorry to you and   to all the others who have been hurt by actions like mine. I know you find it   hard still to walk along Parsonage Street, past the lovely old building. I hope   that one day soon, you will be able to worship within its walls again. Until   that happens, let us join together with Christ in forgiving all that we must,   in repairing what we can and go to the future in the confident hope that the   scars will heal and that there will be singing when we are all, praise God Almighty,   free at last ! \nThank you Sir.",

You have   referred to resolutions and statements and how good churches are in writing   these and publishing them and make them known and then hide behind them. I think   a number of us will find that statement very true, because if the resolutions   made by churches were acted on, we would have been an example of an obedient   church in the light of racism. And that confession, I think, resonates with   a number of us who belong to the church. In your way forward you then report   to us a resolution or a statement which perhaps needs to just be interrogated   a little bit. Where you say the UCCSA wishes to place on record its respect   for the TRC and its hard work, please be assured of our prayers and support   for your task which is so crucial for the future of our land. My question is   how much of this is representative of the church that you speak on behalf of   ? How many members of the church, I know it's very difficult to say how many,   but in terms of how much is the church making its own membership respond to   the TRC? And how much of it is ending at the level of the top leadership in   resolutions which do now get filtered down to the membership of the church?\nREV.",

            "Thank you for the question. I think it would be helpful   just to give some background in order to answer that question. The majority   of the church, the UCCSA, is black. Only 5% I think it is, is white. And the   majority of the black membership, I think it is something in the region of 55%,   is so-called coloured. The church is, to a large extent, a rural church. Very   large concentrations in places like the Northern Cape, Botswana and so forth.   And that all reflects something of the old missionary tradition. I mention this   because the reconciliation that has to take place within our church is less   between white and black, although that of course is important but it's a small   white constituency, of the 350 congregations you can understand, not many of   those are white, but there is a struggle in terms of the relationship between   South Africa and the christians in Botswana and Mozambique and these are very   important issues which we don't think should be lost sight of in terms of the   work of the TRC. The relationship between South Africa and the other countries   of Southern Africa in terms of the role of the church (this has been eluded   to earlier today by the Church of the Province so that when we are talking about   reconciliation, that is a very important factor that has to be taken into account   and secondly, the relationship between coloured members and African members   in the church. This is an area, I think, that is still to be worked through,   and I am not sure that it has been dealt with at all hitherto today in this   Commission.[TAPE 5]..research that has been done recently on reconciliation   within the coloured Catholic community in the Western Cape for example, the   word \"reconciliation\" means something quite different to what we are   talking about here today. And we need to recognise that and I think this is   true within our own church. How to deal with these issues that are issues of   the future is going to become quite critical and it has to do with a whole range   of issues which I needn't allude to here. The role of the church in regard to   this is going to be crucial and I think the fact that the church does exist   in all the kinds of communities, is critical. I am not sure whether that answers   the question, but I wanted to take the question, the answer, to a different   point and maybe you anticipated\nREV.",

It is on the question of the statement which was made earlier   by the CPSA in their very moving submission to the Commission this morning.   Bishop Nuttal drew a distinction between costly reconciliation and cheap reconciliation.   At the time I did not have the chance to ask him to unpack, although I suspect   I know what he means, but I do not know how much is being said from churches   in their teachings to their own members about the real cost of reconciliation   and how much people in this country today think that reconciliation is going   to come out just very cheaply. Is there work that is being done in terms of   spelling out, unpacking the concept of reconciliation and how costly and painful   this process is if we are to follow it in this country.\nREV.",

            "That is clearly not a question addressed to the UCCSA but   more broadly and I'm happy to respond. It does, I think, I think it is clear   that reconciliation is a long process and it's already been said many times   by the Chairperson of this Commission and others that when the work of the TRC   ends, reconciliation still has to be achieved. This is a catalyst and I think   today we have been celebrating in some ways the many people who have suffered   and died in the struggle against apartheid, who identified themselves as christians,   and who, I believe must be regarded as the martyrs of the struggle in South   Africa. I think it is very important for us to remember them because it reminds   us of the cost, not only of achieving what we have achieved so far, but that   what still has to be achieved will be presumably at cost as well. Hopefully,   not at as great a cost, but nevertheless, at cost. And we would want to, as   a church, identify with what the ICT said earlier this morning, and with what   was said by Professor Terblanche; we wouldn't want to comment on the economics   of this in terms of its economic correctness, but unless there is a far greater   sharing of the wealth in this country, unless there is money that will bring   about the kind of drastic reparation that is required, there will not be reconciliation.   And in this respect, can I just make one please, we are a relatively small church,   but we lost 400 mission schools, we had about 100 churches removed by Group   Areas Act. That's a small church, suffered in that way. Other churches which   are much larger suffered more greatly in terms of buildings and loss of schools   and that's been alluded to by the Catholic Church and others. I hope that in   the whole question of looking at the role of the church in the future, and talking   about the role of the church in terms of education and other things, that this   be kept in mind. I don't think the church is asking for reparation, that would   be totally out of place in terms of the enormous reparation that has to be made   to the poor people and the victims of apartheid, but it is indicative of the   cost that the church has to face, and we need to take courage and strength from   those who during that period of time held the faith courageously and to realise   that that is the tradition in which we stand and to which we have to align ourselves.   So yes, indeed, reconciliation continues to be costly.\nREV.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman. We are one segment of the Presbyterian   Church that has been mentioned before. The Reformed Presbyterian Church in Southern   Africa is a black church. It originated from the union of two major Scottish   missions, the missions of the Free Church of Scotland and the United Presbyterian   Church. This union was affected in the formation of the Bantu Presbyterian Church   of South Africa in August 1923. In line with the changes in South Africa, the   name Bantu was dropped in 1978 in favour of the name Reformed Presbyterian Church.   As the name \"Bantu\" indicates, the Reformed Presbyterian Church was   formed as a native experiment. A native church led by natives themselves. It   was born out of a debate within the Scottish missions and the debate centred   on two differing approaches, namely that there must be one Presbyterian Church   in South Africa. The advocates of this view argued that it was wrong for the   Church of Scotland to create two Presbyterian Churches in South Africa. Contrary   to this view was the opinion that there must be a native church. A native Presbyterian   church, led by the natives themselves. In a sense, this was a call for the liberation   of African people from domination by white people in a white led church. In   the African church, Africans would take charge of their destiny and shape their   faith in a way suitable to them. \nWhile today this position may sound in support of the apartheid separate development   policy, at that time it was the most radical thing one could do about the liberation   of the African people. The advocates of this position argued that there was   no community in South Africa in which black and white people lived as equals.   There was also no culture of worshipping together between Europeans and African   converts. At Lovedale and at Umgwali, two racial churches, the European Church   and the Native Church, had emerged within one church. It was thus, within this   context, within the context of its experience as a black church responsible   for a predominantly black membership, that the RPC responded, understood and   acted in the face of gross human rights violations, which happened during the   designated period beginning in 1960 and ending in 1994. Now the question that   has been posed to us, the question whether the theology and the activity of   the Reformed Presbyterian Church contributed to the formation of motives and   perspectives of those who are responsible for the gross human rights violations   raises to us the issue of the morality of the struggle. It raises a christian   ethical question How does a christian respond when faced with a human rights   issue? While the RPC would not abdicate its duty of taking full responsibility   for the actions of its members, we would like to point out that perspectives,   motives and actions of our members who might have committed gross human rights   violations or participated in such actions, within the context of a mob or within   the military wings of political movements, did so not because of direct incitement   resulting from the teachings of the RPC. There is no particular case, at least   known to us, which directly links our church to any actions of human rights   violations. It is also unknown to us that there has been any charge that actions   of human rights violations committed either by a mob, kangaroo courts or military   wings of political organisations or committed in any other form, emanated from   the teachings of the church. The RPC as a member of the South African Council   of Churches, which reported this morning Mr Chairman, the RPC has acted according   to the understanding of the South African political situation by supporting   the SACC. Like other member churches of the SACC, the RPC has been faithful   in its preaching of peace and reconciliation. An honest attempt to deal with   the question relating to the contribution of the RPC in creating a climate or   justification for human rights violations, must of necessity call to mind certain   important factors which must be seen as having greatly influenced our church.   For many years the RPC along with many other mainline churches, adopted a negative   or at best, a neutral stance towards the liberation struggle, thereby helping   to create a climate conducive to the violation of human rights.\nAn inherited racist system which eventually matured into apartheid created   the social and economic climate into which we, as a church, were born and socialised   in 1923. Whether you benefited from the system, or suffered under it, the racist   system was a given if you were black. It formed our consciousness of reality   and socialised us into a value system which sheepishly accepted racism. Individualism,   selfishness, possessiveness and money as the merger of all values. In order   to inculcate a culture of docility and acceptance of the status quo by the church,   the apartheid regime often pointed at Romans 13. This was done to discourage   members of the churches from taking part in actions of civil disobedience. The   result was that this often caused the general membership of the church to refuse   to follow a leadership that was politically active. Often it was this conditioning   that was responsible for the failure of the church to lend meaningful support   and protection to those who felt called to act. Religious propaganda that emanated   from the apartheid system was effective, Mr Chairperson. It made many of our   members feel guilty about any form of opposition, disobedience or even criticism   of the government's policy. As a result, the church was silent when it should   actually have spoken out. Because of its silence, when it should have spoken,   it is guilty of collaboration with the system that caused great suffering to   many innocent people. For that we wish to repent and apologise to all those   who suffered because we were quiet. The church often took refuge in obstructions   which removed them from the realities of life. It often resorted to formulas   and formalities which were far removed from the harsh realities of daily lives.   Lives of its members, even though it was a black church. The trouble with this   kind of religion is that it fails to listen to the cries of the oppressed. It   was this kind of abstract christianity which allowed the apartheid regime to   carry on for so many years. For that we also wish to apologise unreservedly. \nMr Chairperson, a charge has been laid to the churches and other leaders of   churches and theologians by a certain John K. Burman, this has been referred   to this morning. I will not dwell on it. In summary, I would just like to say   that we reject the accusations that he levels against the churches. The question   also, another question which has been posed to the church is In which way did   the RPC fail to live up to those values and principles of the christian faith   which oppose human rights violations? \nThe membership of the RPC, Mr Chairperson, as we have already said, consists   mainly of the part of our society who have been victims of apartheid. There   are specific responsibilities which the christian gospel places upon a church,   which finds itself in the midst of such victims as the RPC found itself in the   period which the TRC is investigating. Christian teaching would require such   a church to have a pastoral ministry which is relevant to the situation in which   its members find themselves in their day to day lives. Although from time to   time, the RPC made public statements condemning human rights violations that   apartheid committed, it failed to formulate a specific programme of action which   would reflect a church which is in solidarity with the struggles of the oppressed.   Our teaching, preaching and witness did not differ from that of the so-called   multi-racial churches, most of which have reported this morning. For this we   must confess and repent. We did not stand firm and unashamedly on the side of   those who were the victims of apartheid atrocities. We lived with them. They   were our total membership. We lived with them everyday, but we did not embrace   their struggles as a black church would have done. \nWhen the apartheid government embarked on a strategy of co-opting black leadership   into the mainstream of apartheid through the creation of Bantu Stand, many of   our members at clergy and later levels were used to lend respectability to this   policy. We recognise that there are members of our church who, much against   their will, served as civil servants because they had no option but to seek   employment within those systems. But we also have to confess and repent for   the fact that there are some who took very senior positions in the Bantu Stand   machinery and played very key roles in sustaining and defending this system   of separate development. We repent for those who are members of the RPC who   have not had the courage to repent for themselves. We also have to repent for   the manner in which we failed to support those who took a position of faith   and stood up to oppose the system of apartheid. Some of our sisters and brothers   were marginalised within the church for their prophetic stance against apartheid.   The propaganda which was spread against all those who were fighting for justice   in our land, was too powerful. We confess and repent that this blinded our eyes   to the truth, and some of us adopted the language of the system in labelling   some of our fellow christians as communists and terrorists.

I will highlight here and I would like to apologise on behalf of the   church to the Reverend Soga here next to me, the Reverend Finca here, and many   others who stood up at a time that was very critical in the life of our church,   that we didn't give support. At other times when they were detained, we did   not visit them. But I would like to say, Mr Chairperson, that the awareness   of the evil of the apartheid system grew with the awareness, with the level   of awareness in the black community in general. Fear was widespread in the black   community, because as you know the apartheid system spread its tentacles deep   into the black communities and if you spoke out you were snatched easily. Everyone   wanted to save his skin, and we did so most of the time in the RPC, letting   our fellow ministers and brothers and sisters who felt called to act at the   time to feel both vulnerable and isolated from our community. We unreservedly   wish to apologise to them and to the whole community of South Africa.\nWe also have indicated in our reports, Mr Chairman, how we would like to see   the future of South Africa in terms of healing and reconciliation. We would   like to highlight a few things, particularly that we recognise that there is   a spirit, there is a general spirit of denial in the white community. In particular   we have been watching the process of the TRC unfold. In the white community   seems that the general feeling is that they did not know what was happening.   The apartheid machinery hid its human rights abuses from them. As a result they   feel embarrassed by revelations of human rights abuse by the government they   supported and feel impatient with the truth of the past. Some of them, we feel   correctly or incorrectly Mr Chairman, that some white people in our community   want a quick fix reconciliation where the nation will not dwell on the human   violations of the past but will hurriedly move forward into the future in the   spirit of reconciliation. In the black community we observe, Mr Chairperson,   that the question is Did indeed white people not know what was happening in   the country? Or did white people not want to know? It is this understanding   that our church feels that it can contribute to the process of national healing   by developing a theology of reconciliation. It must emphasise the requirement   for reconciliation such as has been mentioned already, economic reconciliation,   national healing and the preaching of relevant messages and openness to the   truth that has happened in the past and the hurt that has happened in the past.

On the question of whether the Reformed   Presbyterian Church has recommendations on how to prevent human rights violations   in the new South Africa, we feel that there has got to be visible signs that   change has come in our country. If you look at the treatment of our people at   government offices. People are made to stand in long queues, subjected to different   kinds of weather and the treatment they have to get from our young clerks, leaves   much to be desired, and so there is a cry among the ordinary people, men and   women of our country, that there is absolutely no difference, you know, from   the situation that prevailed under the apartheid system as far as this type   of treatment is concerned. So we believe that there has got to be a paradigm   shift. Let's make an effort to bring to the notice of the ordinary people that   change has taken place, or is beginning to take place. So that people are being   treated better than they have been. For so long, people have suffered under   the ruthlessness of government officials of the past regime. So we feel that   we have got to put pressure on the government to attend to these problems and   find a way of introducing better treatment of our people at government offices.   For instance, I'm thinking of the Department of Social Welfare where there is   a lot of controversy and many complaints from our people who feel that they   are being let down by a government they have voted for, so we are gravely concerned   about that, and we do promise that we will do our best as a predominantly black   church to lend our support to whatever action the government will take, and   we will do our part as individuals or congregations where we are based, to try   and make a contribution towards addressing this problem.",

I am quite amazed that normally you are so noisy   when you shouldn't be and when I give you permission to be noisy, you are suddenly   all so very coy and cultured. Goeie more, let me hear you. Molweni. Good Morning.   Much better. We welcome you all very, very warmly to this the second day of   this special hearing of the Commission the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.   REPEATS WELCOME IN AFRIKAANS AND XHOSA.\nWe also want just to say a big thank you again to all the people of this centre   for making available these splendid facilities, we are deeply grateful to you   and to Bongani Finca and his colleagues, members of staff in this region for   the preparations they have made. I want you to know that we do have outstanding   colleagues and staff persons, very dedicated people and I want again to say   a big thank you to the committee, the special committee that was set up to organise   these special hearings. I want particularly to welcome and give thanks to the   representatives and adherents of other faiths gathered here today. First I want   to thank you and those whom you represent for the sterling contribution that   you have made to the struggle for justice, freedom and democracy in this land.   We can all attest to the fact that we walked arm in arm in our demonstrations   with Jews and Muslims and Hindu and others and that we are where we are today   to a very large extend because of that co-operation during the days of the struggle. \nIt is also good that we acknowledge the contributions that members of other   faiths have made and continue to make in the development and the prosperity   of our land. Just think of the many people of other faiths who are doctors and   lawyers and engineers who are making splendid contributions, members of the   business sector and we want to acknowledge that contribution to. Second, I would   want and I'm sure that all of my fellow christians would want to apologise to   you members of other faiths for our arrogance as christians when for so very   long, we behaved as if we were the only religious faith in this country, when   in fact from the year dot, we have been a multi- faith society. You can think   of how in the past, hardly any member of a faith that was not christian was   given a chance on public radio and television and we made the arrogant claim   and a claim that is difficult to justify that this was a christian country.   I have never known what we meant by that unless we were merely claiming that   the majority of the population were christians, which is not a particularly   remarkable fact, but it seems as if we were tacitly claiming in a kind of way   that we were probably conspicuous embodiments of christian virtues. But even   if you were to say that there was a thing such as a christian country, the experience   that we have had in the world is that those that would have claimed to be this,   have not usually excelled. It was christians supporting Nazism, it is christians   fighting fellow christians in Northern Ireland, and we in this country are a   singular, almost a spectacular example of a country which had an immoral and   evil system that some sought to buttress by claiming that it was biblically   based and that if you said it is a christian country, which christianity? Which   is the christian position on for instance, abortion? On homosexuality? On Sunday   observance? On capital punishment? There are about as many views on these and   other controversial subjects as there are christians. \nWe claim, quite rightly, that God is the only source of goodness, of beauty   and truth. And clearly, christians do not have a monopoly on these. Can anyone   doubt that a Mahatma Ghandi was an eminently good person? That an Einstein was   a genius? And if God is the only source of truth, of goodness, then these are   eminently God inspired persons. And that christians do not have, could never   have, a monopoly on this. To acknowledge the reality of the existence of other   faiths does not mean that you are a christian and need compromise on the ...[inaudible]   that you hold dear. I hold very firmly to what our faith teaches that Jesus   Christ is the unique and perfect revelation of God. And I will not compromise   this central aspect of my faith. But that does not mean that I should then arrogantly   ride rough shod, boots and all, on what others claim who are not christians   to be their holy ground. The transcendent one is infinite and no human being   who claimed to be a genuine worshipper could ever claim that any faith comprehends   the transcendent utterly and completely, because then that transcendent would   not be transcendent. And so we should welcome humbly, thankfully the insights   of others. After all, the very bible that we hold so dear could refer to a servant   who stood outside the covenant relationship that God had with his people, a   sign that God is not limited by our limitations. The love of God embraces all   and when we are narrow we limit God to the parameters of our own comprehension.\nWe should be open to what God may be saying to us through others whom we could   not claim to stand outside of God's care. And in any case, just as we worked   together for the demise of apartheid, so now we need desperately to work together   with all people of goodwill, with all people of faith, as we seek the healing   of our land, we strive the reconciliation of those who, for so long, were alienated   from one another. And more than anything, we know that our country is looking   to the faith community to assist in the rehabilitation of moral values in our   land. To work together for the abolition of poverty, to bring prosperity and   peace and stability to our land and we thank God that today is possible. So   we call on the first to testify, Dr Franz Auerbach. May I say that today we   are going to be a little less generous and say that we want each presentation   to take a total of 30 minutes. Something like twenty or so minutes for the presentation   and then ten minutes for exchanges. But we welcome you very warmly, Dr Auerbach   and thank God for your wonderful witness as an educationalist and in your striving   for justice in our land. Thank you.\nDR F.",

            "Thank you very much. I think then I need perhaps in the context   of these hearings to say first of all that the World Conference on Religion   and Peace (and I apologise because you yourself Sir, know this better than I   do) is not in fact a faith community. It is also not a collective as some people   believe of all the faith communities. We have been able to speak, but we've   never been able to say that we speak for all the members of all the faith communities   with whom we have contact in the form of membership. Rather, we are an organisation   of individuals and a few organisations drawn from various faith groups. A collective   made up of those who joined by accepting our basic tenant and the commitment   of striving for peace and justice. Now, I need perhaps to explain that the South   African chapter of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, which in the   world was started in 1920, the South African chapter was started in 1984 and   it was started specifically in order to bring together those people of different   faiths, who were united in their struggle for justice and opposition to apartheid   in South Africa, so that in a sense, you can say maybe this was a late start   in South Africa, because in the history of apartheid and the history of what   your commission, the period your commission covers, 1984 is late. It is not   early. So that we wanted to be a part of those who were struggling against apartheid   in the eighties in particular and we have felt it particularly enriching that   through our commons commitment to justice from different faiths, from christians,   Muslims, Jews and Hindus, we have found something to which you have in a sense   referred to in your opening remarks, which is that there are many commonalties   between different religions and that a belief in justice is a powerful cement   that can hold people together.\nAnd therefore, when we came together, we tried in various ways to bring people   together for that purpose and one of the, I would say, major ways in which we   did that was to organise the annual peace lecture, which we named after you   Sir, when you got the Nobel Peace Prize. And perhaps it's worth putting on record   what we have written here. The first lecture to have been delivered by you in   December 1985, was banned by the State. Perhaps it's worth saying that and I   quote \"The police had reason to apprehend that the safety of members of   the public and their property will be seriously endangered by a gathering being   organised by the South African Chapter of the World Conference on Religion and   Peace\". I might say, Sir, that at the time I was working at the Funda Centre   in Soweto and I remember seeing the State's notice on the door of the office   of the building in which I worked, so I had a particular awareness of that at   the time. The State also refused visas to six of nine international religious   leaders in the international World Conference of Religion and Peace, who had   intended to attend the lecture in order to demonstrate their solidarity with   the fledgling South African chapter and one of the reasons, it should perhaps   be stated, that the lecture was instituted is to remind people of faith to put   into practice those sanctions and traditions of justice and peace which are   inherent in their respective religions.\nDuring more than a decade we learnt to work together for commons goals while   respecting one another's different beliefs and practices. In line with this,   we invited representatives of different faiths to deliver the lectures Christian,   Hindu, Jewish and Muslim speakers and last year, his holiness the Dali Lama   addressed us, so that many of the people who spoke have been eminent persons   within and beyond their own religious traditions. During the eighties, we did   campaign for justice and against apartheid in a variety of ways. It is perhaps   worth singling out that WCRP protested when some elements in the Dutch Reformed   Church declared Islam a false religion and we felt that this should be publicly   opposed because there were many ways in which Muslims and Christians, especially   but not only in the Western Cape, had worked together in the liberation struggle   and this kind of view of declaring another religion false would disturb relationships.   So we protested against that and some of the other matters we did is that we   took a delegation, that you in fact led a delegation of WCRP to Lusaka with   a joint consultation with a liberation movement in exile on religious communities   in a post-apartheid South Africa. And we have, over the years, been quite active   in bringing together the various religious bodies. In a conference in May 1988   we organised a consultation in Soweto on the subject Believers in the Struggle   for Justice and Peace, and then following a suggestion by Judge Albie Sacks,   we did organise in 1990 a conference, proceedings of which have also been published,   Believers in the Future, a conference of national religious leaders to discuss   the future of religion and state relations in post-apartheid South Africa.\nNow, we realise of course in May 1990, these things were easier than they had   been before. But that conference saw a very large number of people from a variety   of faiths articulating their views on religion, state relationships and following   that gathering in 1990, we organised a process of trying to work out a declaration   of religious rights and responsibility which was finally adopted at a conference   in Pretoria two years later, after very extensive consultations among different   religious groups and I think we could well argue that some of the later togetherness   of different faiths on public occasions such as most notably, the inauguration   of President Mandela, had their origin in these two conferences in 1990 and   1992, where people actually came together to look at religion as an aspect of   society without in the first instance looking at whether it was the Muslim or   Christian or Jewish or Hindu or other religion. \nI do not know what otherperhaps I should leave justshould make   two further points that obviously we do not claim that we did all we should   have done in order to bring more members of various faith communities together   in the struggle for justice. We were sometimes well aware of the fact that within   our faith communities, the support given to the kinds of endeavours that WCRP   stood for were not supported by the majority of religious groups. Sometimes   some of us felt marginalised by being seen as sort of \"way out there\".   But nevertheless, speaking for myself, I didn't ever encounter hostility within   my own faith community. Maybe alienation and I think that applies possibly to   some other religious communities as well. But certainly we tried and I guess   that is the first step on the path to reconciliation - we never did attempt   to cut loose from our major religious communities and while we might have marched   with those with whom the majority did not march, we didn't ever sort of say,   \"We won't talk to the rest of you if you don't march with us\". \nAs to the future, we did undertake last year an interesting process on religious   interpretations of reconciliation and we've taken the liberty of attaching the   results of that to this submission. It resulted in a proposal on reconciliation   and nation building and through quite extensive consultation we produced a three   page document on the subject and we targeted it at the day of reconciliation   last year, but while we distributed it widely, it didn't have the echo that   we hoped it would have, but we believe that it remains relevant and we accept   and we hope to make a contribution. We accept that your commission alone cannot   complete or even take vastly forward the process of reconciliation because it   contains elements that, as a commission, you cannot deal with, but as faith   communities and as a joint body representing people in faith communities, we   can make a contribution by bringing people together in the process of reconciliation.   We realise it's a long process, but we also realise that it's a difficult process   and that we have experience of talking glibly of bringing people together and   failing to do so. It's not so easy because people still to a very large extent   remain locked into their own groups and their own communities. I think, if I   may, I'll stop there and leave the rest to debate.

I have only one question to raise and   I would like to base it on the concluding comments that you have made where   you say that the commission is not going to be able to deliver a reconciled   nation at the time when we stop working sometime next year. There are some people   in this country who think that the commission should be able, in June or July   next year, to say , \"Here is a reconciled South Africa\". You are saying   that we point the way to the nation that this is the route that this nation   must take in order to travel on the road that will lead it ultimately to reconciliation   and that way is owning up to what has happened and disclosing the truth. On   the religious communities that are represented in the WCRP, do you find that   there is a common trend or commonality in terms of the religious beliefs on   the understanding of reconciliation, founded on truth, which is a solid base   on which the religious communities can co-operate in taking the process of reconciliation   further after the commission has finished its work?",

            "DR F AUERBACH",
            "Yes, I do think that there is a common base. Maybe in order   to talk on that I could quote from a document that we did draw up and in order   not to waste time, I will just say that looking at the four major religions   in the main; Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Hinduism, and I am sure others   won't be different. When you put it together, you find that people say if you   want reconciliation there are seven steps and in listing them, I ask you to   think of obviously only some of these can fall within the ambit of your commission,   the rest has to be taken up by society in general. But if we look around the   world and see the imperfections of reconciliation of past conflicts, people   seem to have incredibly long memories. I personally always encapsulate that   by saying don't blame me for what my grandfather did, whatever he may have done.   But humanity does not work like that. People get blamed for things that their   particular communities did generations ago. However, the seven steps are becoming   aware of having done wrong; publicly acknowledging the wrong doing; expressing   remorse for the action or lack of action; making restitution for the harm caused;   requesting forgiveness from the harmed person; making a sincere commitment not   to repeat the wrong doing; and accepting forgiveness where it is offered. \nWe found that all religions will agree on that and most religions will tell   you that if you don't do them all, you're not going to get there and I believe   that it's a task for South Africa as a whole to go on working at that. Even   the last one accepting forgiveness where it is offered is sometimes a very   difficult one and I know your commission experienced that in individual cases.   There are religions that say that it's a religious duty to accept forgiveness   when it is offered, but we also accept that having our human failings, people   find it very difficult to forgive. So that if we take all these steps, public   acknowledgement of what happened, that the commission has done wonderfully.   It is now addressing the issue of some making some restitution and given my   own background as a Jewish person alive at the time the holocaust, I know a   little bit about efforts in the past made about restitution. But those are only   some aspects of reconciliation and I think we need to teach South Africa that   this is a long process that we've got to work at. But I think one of the major   problems of our reconciliation efforts as I see it is that we don't actually   know a great deal as communities of the experiences of other communities in   South Africa in the past and therefore we often talk to each other without knowing   enough of the background, as I put it; What's at the back of the head? And I   believe that it's a very difficult thing to learn that, and what we really need   to do is to spend more time listening to one another. But our whole society   is still partly organised so that we don't actually meet many people of different   groups, so that in a sense, my answer is yes, WCRP will go on working at it   and so will other people. We are a small group and we have to date made some   important impact, but not nearly as much impact as perhaps we should have done   and if we have greater capacity, we can perhaps do more capacity and determination.

I do not believe that I as a Muslim theologian can represent the   Muslim community, neither do I put it to you, can any of the \"representatives\"   here represent their communities. Which Dutch Reform Church representative can   speak for Hendrik Verwoerd and for Malanie Verwoerd? Or for Willie Lubbe and   for Gerrie Lubbe? Or for Eugene Terreblanche and Sampie Terreblanche? Or for   Willie Breytenbach and Breyten Breytenbach? Which Jewish Rabbi can speak for   Sol Kerzner and David Bruce. And I dare say, which Muslim theologian could speak   for Mohammed Bham, that human rights activist and for Ibrahim Bham, the person   who is supposed to have been here and who now heads Radio Islam, the radio that   denies women a voice on their stations because men get turned on by the voices   of women? And so, I can only speak for myself and I speak for those Muslims   who felt that they had to South Africanise their Islam and by that, to develop   an empathy with the people of our land and to identify with their suffering   and to give their everything to alleviate the pain and the injustice that visited   our land.\nAs the for the past, Mr Chairman, the past apartheid, the injustices are only   in some ways about 1948 the Nationalist Party, the Bureau of State Security,   Bantu Education, Homelands, etc, etc, but it is also about Christian triumphalism.   It's also about the fact that as Muslims were subjected to Christian national   education. We were forced into it. It is also about symbols like that that continue   to dominate a process like this even. I'm talking about the symbol of the crucifix,   it's a bit of an irony, and despite[SIDE 2]the denying of women   to open bank accounts or accounts in shops on their own. It's also about women   in Kwa Zulu Natal, who have to fold up their mattresses against the walls when   their husbands go back to the cities and the mattress can only come down once   their husbands come back. The past is also about the control of women's bodies.   It's about the denial of the right of children to be children and of adults   to be adults. Adults as beings responsible for their own bodies, for their own   sexual, personal and social lives. The past is an embracing past. And I make   this point because if we do not understand the all embracing nature of the injustices   of the past, what will happen is that as religious people, we have this remarkable   ability to shift as the winds shift, to change our theology as the wind changes.   And so our confessions in front of you, our lamentations about the past, these   are mere games of adjustments that we make, as the power structures in our country   have changed. And all of our confessions, if we do not recognise the comprehensives   of the injustices that have visited our land, if we do not recognise it, our   confessions here will amount to sprinkling a little bit of perfume over a heap   of cow dung in the hope that the smell will disappear.\nAs Muslims, Muslims were never singled out during the apartheid era, for any   special kind of oppression. We formed part of four fears that the regime persistently   articulated swart gevaar, rooi gevaar, room se gevaar en die Islam se gevaar.   But it was part of a combination of these four dangers that Muslims had fitted   into. There was one exception in the way in which the apartheid regime treated   us, and that is that our Mosques were left untouched under the Group Areas Act.   And so you had the spectacle of, currently still visible in District Six for   example, of a large area of vacant land and you only see the Mosques. They did   leave St. Marks Church there also, but that is because they couldn't possibly   leave four Mosques, and demolish one church. But in the other group areas throughout   the country, they also demolished churches, and that was the only exception   they made for Muslims. Under the Group Areas Act, Muslims, a minority community,   were uprooted from their homes, thrown into the middle of nowhere, away from   the business centres, Muslim business owners were removed into isolated other   areas. And we suffered lot, but we did not suffer as Muslims. We suffered as   coloured people, we suffered as Indian people and there are a handful of blacks   and a handful of whites. And at the same time as coloured people and as Indian   people, we were also privileged. The colour preferential job policy in the Western   Cape, for example. The way in which the Muslim business community in Gauteng   and Kwa Zulu Natal benefited in many ways from the system. And how, for the   vast majority of blacks, for very many blacks, the first line of oppression   that they met was often Muslims, the Muslim business keeper or the Muslim housewife   in whose house they were employed as a servant. And that is why often people   do not understand how you can talk about Islam and a struggle against apartheid   in the same breath. Because in our own personal lives, in our homes and businesses,   we were no different from those \"white\" people that we sometimes reduce   to as the \"oppressor\". \nAs far as our collaboration and resistance to the system is concerned, there   is the community at large. In truth, the community at large was a complacent   community, feeble in its responses and going whichever way the wind was going   at a particular moment. And then there was the religious leadership of the community.   The essential attitude of that religious leadership, despite whatever nice words   have been coming in the last few years as a part of this theology of accommodation,   is essentially one of betrayal. In 1979, Imam Abdullah Harum was murdered in   detention after being kept there for six months. Twenty five thousand people   attended his funeral, and not a single voice in the Muslim community was raised   about the nature of his death, and all the injuries on his body. Not a single   voice in the Muslim community from the religious leadership of the Muslim community.   And this silence, Mr Chairman, held for seven years, non-stop! At a Mosque level   and in a Muslim publication level. Of course I speak with anger. By God, I've   got a damn right to be angry! For seven years the silence held. He was a nice   man. He was praised for being a good religious leader, but of course we don't   know why, we can't say anything about the reasons for his detention. And now   it has come out he was murdered. The Muslim Judicial Council, from 1961 up   to the period of 1964 issued five statements condemning different acts of apartheid.   A total of five statements and held a single public meeting. The two other dominant   cleric councils in Natal and the Transvaal, did not issue a single statement,   and did not ever hold a single meeting. On the contrary, there was persistent   denial of space and of legitimacy to all of those Muslim activists and organisations   that were a part of the struggle. I studied Islamic Theology for eight years   in a seminary. Five years of it with the person who was supposed to have been   here before me, and who is in perfect good health, certainly by late last night   and three years in another seminary. For four years I spent doing my doctorate   for ...[inaudible] and I spent another two years doing post-doctoral work in   biblical ...[inaudible]. The Muslim clergy described me in their paper as an   ignoramus masquerading as a theologian. I am not personalising all of this,   I am only saying that this is the way the religious leadership treated those   of us who were a part of the struggle. But our history, Mr Chairman, and I want   to get to the end, is not only one of collaboration and betrayal. Our community   has given rise to remarkable individuals, people who were deeply inspired by   our faith Islam, people such as Achmad Timol, who fell down, who slipped on   a bar of soap, and then he died in John Vorster Square. People like Babla Selojee,   who \"hanged himself\". People like Jusuf ...[inaudible], a 22 year   old person, nine months into his marriage being blown apart by a boobie trap   hand-grenade, and people like Moegsien Jina. We have produced many, many activists,   the likes of Ebrahim Rassoul, the likes of Achmad Kassiem, Jusuf Patel, Rafiek   Ruhan, people who have earned their stripes on Robin Island. \nAnd then there were the Muslim organisations. The Call of Islam which I headed,   the MYM (Muslim Youth Movement) and Kibala, the latter especially added an enormous   amount to the growing militancy of the eighties. They mobilised the Muslim community   and they travelled the length and breadth of the country, organising thousands   of people. And the Call of Islam particularly focusing on inter-religious solidarity   against apartheid. And I served as the National Vice-President of the WCRP for   about six years, and at the same time Mr Chairman, we gave the impression that   we got our communities on board. We succeeded in shutting up and marginalising   in public the leadership of our communities. We succeeded in embarrassing them   and never succeeded in getting them on board. Internally in the community, in   the religious circles we remained the marginalised, we remained the mavericks. \nAs a matter of interest, I wasn't initially intended to be the speaker here   today. But as I pointed out to Dr Piet Meiring, the time that people like myself   are on the margins, was yesterday, not today. Today people like myself are in   the centre of South Africa and that's where we are going to remain. \nA word about reconciliation to conclude with. I have been on record as criticising   the Christianisation of this process. I maintain, Mr Chairman, that I have a   great fear that this commission will focus on nice language at the end of the   day, that your own humanity, and I am referring to Archbishop Desmond Tutu,   that your own humanity, that your own unbounded grace is going to reflect far   too heavily in the report of this commission and that the anger and the pain   that our people have experienced, on the one hand, and on the other hand the   lies and games that the State and religious figures come to you with, the accommodation   tactics, the peppering over of the cracks, I fear that they will get away with   it. And so truth, reconciliation is premised on truth, but reconciliation is   not only premised on truth, reconciliation is also premised on justice. And   so when this process is finished, it is not truth and reconciliation that is   finished. It will only be the beginning and I will want to see recommendations   in your report that essentially addresses the question of truth and justice   as means to reconciliation, because reconciliation is not an end by itself.   I do not want to reconcile with those who want to turn over a new page, but   they have given me no indication that they have actually read the page that   I am putting in front of them at the moment. \nThank you very much, and God bless you all.",

            "Thank you very much. Just a point of correction. I was the   National Co-Ordinator of the Call of Islam during the years under discussion.   I no longer retain any position in the Call of Islam. \nI think that essentially words such as peace and reconciliation are vague and   empty, if they are not accompanied by a very real socio-economic changes and   dynamics that are effected within our society to concretise these concepts.   It is all very well for me to have a Malawian (Malawian by the way is a word   that is used for black Muslims inside South Africa very often because the early   black Muslims had come from Malawi so we talk about our Malawian brothers),   it is very easy for example to have a black Muslim with me in the Mosque and   so on and then we pray together and shake hands and hug together, and that is   the end of the story. But my Muslim black brother would have to go in the end   to the street where he sleeps in and I go back to my palace. And so, despite   the limitedness of your own mandate, there is the significant question of economic   justice as a means to true reconciliation. That is the one thing. The other   thing of where people come to the TRC and they come and we lament our tales   and we cry and in the end there are no firm recommendations from this commission   about how reparations are going to be done, and you end up with \"finders   keepers, losers weepers\", quite literally the losers come here and weep   again, and they go out and they are still the losers, and so there needs to   be a recommendation on economic redistribution of the resources of our land.   Certainly in Islam forgiveness is premised on returning stolen goods. There   is no forgiveness without ...[inaudible] without a return of whatever ill begotten   gains you have, and so for me this return of the ill begotten gains, radical   as it may sound, unfashionable as socialist ideals may be sounding today, for   me that is the only avenue to any kind of authenticity to reconciliation.",

If you think that it was difficult to get Muslims on board the struggle against   apartheid, you don't know what you've got coming to you when you talk about   the battle for gender justice. Yesterday, mercifully, the High Court ruled against   Radio Islam, when Radio Islam insisted that the IBA had no authority to take   action against it. There are we started from a very, very difficult situation.   The Christian Church is debating whether women should be ordained. Of course,   as the Reverend Father has always said, I mean, Priesthood is a calling. We   have always said that the Priesthood is a calling. If it is a calling from God,   why on earth can't we leave it up to God to decide whom he wants to call? But   at least Christians are debating that, Muslims are still debating whether women   should be allowed into the Mosque or not! And so we are in the dark ages. There   are small glimmers of hope. In a Mosque like the Claremont Main Road Mosque,   the only Mosque in the world where women preach, sometimes on a Friday. The   only Mosque in the world and we are proud that it is in South Africa! There   is gender activists, deeply committed Muslims who are fighting to retain their   identities as Muslims and at the same time to be true to their own identity   as oppressed gendered beings, but these are small candles in the darkness, and   I don't know, certainly not in our lifetime.

Because of some of the confessions that have   been made, some true, some untrue, of three accused persons being charged for   murder appearing in a court of law. And when asked by the presiding Judge which   one of them was pleading guilty two of them raised their hands and said we're   pleading not-guilty. The third one who was the smallest in size of the three,   simply said \"Excuse me your Lordship, I want to plead guilty\". And   the Judge looked at him and said \"Are you guilty of murder?\" He says   \"No, no I choose perjury\" and the Judge asked him why and he said   \"The sentence to lie is so much more lenient than the sentence for murder\". \nMr Chair, I must preface my presentation by making the comment, and I think   Professor Meiring will confirm this, that the Hindu community was advised rather   late, through no fault of anybody, these things happen, in making this submission.   And our submission inasmuch as we've made them to you were made under a great   deal of hurry and rush and we hope that we have done as good a job as we would   have like to have done, in the circumstances. We thank you for inviting the   South African Hindu Community, represented by the South African Hindu Maha Sabha,   to make submissions to the Faith Communities Hearing here in East London today. \nAs and by way of an introduction, we want to state that South Africans of Indian   origin came to this country from about the 16th November 1860 onwards as migrant   labourers to work in the sugar industry in Natal. By 1910, three years before   the immigration was finally stopped, 133 437 persons had arrived in Natal. Ninety   five percent of these were members of the Hindu faith. Today, their descendants   form the core of the South African Indian population of 1 million, the largest   Indian group outside India. There was another group as well that arrived here   and they were known as the passenger Indians who were basically traders and   merchants. The Indian immigrants laboured under slave-like conditions on the   sugar farms, working long hours from sunrise to sunset and sometimes over 12   hours on a daily basis. They lived in unfurnished barracks and on rations. Children   were not provided with education, nor were proper health and hospital care arranged   for sick people. It was therefore not surprising that thousands of sugar workers   on the farms and mills, together with their women folk joined coal miners from   Northern Natal and crossed the Natal/Transvaal border in defiance of the provincial   barriers and in protest against the three pound poll tax imposed on all adult   immigrants free from their indenture and who still remained in this country.   And then of course, we had Mahatma Gandhi. There were many Hindus, both in Natal   and the Transvaal, who took part in the first passive resistance campaign of   the 1906 and 1914 era which was launched by Mahatma Gandhi soon after his arrival   as a lawyer in South Africa. He later was to devil up Satyagraha, a non-violent   passive resistance movement in his struggle for equality, justice and human   dignity. \nOn freedom, Gandhi's conception was the co-existence with the freedom of man.   To him, truth was that there was the higher nature in every human being which   is the reflection of truth or God. He had implicit trust in the goodness of   human nature. Gandhi told us of the bravery and sacrifice of the ordinary Indian   labourer, mainly Hindus, but also of other faiths who fought with courage and   bravery during the campaign of protest and voluntary jail, of assaults on the   resistors by the police and of cruel jail conditions under which they served   their imprisonment. As a preamble to this presentation, it is important to note   that Hindus regard all forms of life as being endowed with supreme spirit, but   at different levels of manifestation. The Hindus firmly uphold the doctrine   of Ahimsa, which means non-injury in any form. Thus is can be concluded from   this assumption that they are strongly opposed to any form of violence against   any living being. Hindus, together with all self respecting human beings, opposed   and still oppose all forms of discrimination. Every Hindu, generally has his   own personal relationship with God of his understanding. He or she prefers to   work and worship without putting strong emphasis on his or her Hinduism. It   is also a proselytising religion, seeking individuals to convert into his or   her own fold. Some of the frustration and anger aroused in Hindus was that they   did not get the support from the State insofar as its religion and cultural   aspirations were concerned. Even up to the recent past, Hindus were not allowed   to invite religious scholars or cultural artists to promote their values. Hindu   marriages were, and are still not given status, and are considered to be illegitimate.   The legal system was practised with some measure of bias. Punishment depended   on the colour of the skin. Such was the order of the day. \nAs a community, Hindus opposed human right violations of any kind. After the   departure of Mahatma Gandhi in 1914 a number of members of the community deeply   involved in the struggle against discrimination and human rights violations,   and some of them, and I don't mean to have an exhaustive list here, were Dr   Monty Naiker, Nana Seetha, Debbie Sing, J.M. Sing, Mac Maharaj, Soonabjee Rastanjee,   Thumbie Naidoo, Dr Kay Gwinum, P.S. Joshee, just to name a few. This does not   mean that the Hindu community was not without problems. The Indian community   neither supported nor condoned the actions of the apartheid regime. In the period   between 1946 and 1948, they launched the second passive resistance campaign   after the passing of the pegging act in 1943 and the Asiatic Land Tenure Act   of 1946 when over 2000 men and women resisted passively and went to jail. However,   when the tricameral system was established, most Hindus did not offer any support   to those who took up positions in that parliament. The voting pattern during   the elections was a sufficient indication of the lack of support given by the   community to that system. However, we regret that some Hindus chose to serve   in that parliament. In its early history, colonial power responsible for Indian   immigration did not anticipate that Indians would become an economic threat   to white settlers. The land procured by Indians after the expiry of the indenture   was soon to be efficiently tilled and farmed. In a short time, they became prosperous   market gardeners, providing vegetable requirements for the whites. Debates soon   ensued in government and local circles to repatriate the Indians back to India.   This feeling resulted in the signing of the Cape Town agreement in 1927, between   India and South Africa which provided that should Indians remain in South Africa,   education would be uplifted, but this remained in breach. And those who wished   to return to India would be assisted with a free passage. \nFrom as far back as 60 years or so, the life of the community became severely   affected by the introduction of the periodic laws governing land tenure. Each   new enactment deprived its people of existing property rights and radically   reducing areas in which Indian occupation and ownership was permitted. The most   serious and painful of legislation was the Group Areas Act passed in 1950. Settled   communities who had built little schools and temples were rudely uprooted by   the ruling class and relocated to some distant areas or new areas with very   little facilities. Kato Manor in Durban was one of the many affected areas where   Indians settled, built homes, started their own market gardening and worked   as unskilled labourers. When this area was declared a white area, under the   Group Areas Act, the Indian Community received the biggest blow to its survival.   To name one of many, the Arian Benevolent Home, which started as a home for   the homeless in 1921, was badly affected in the grand settlement plan. It took   about 15 years to find an alternative for re-settlement at a much higher cost.   In the process, the old, the disabled and the affected children had to endure   immeasurable hardships. In all such areas, including Johannesburg, where the   Group Areas applied, temples, schools and cultural centres had to be left behind.   Some such temples were ...[inaudible] temple in Kingsgate, the ...[inaudible]   temple in Umbilo and the ...[inaudible] in College Road, Overport. \nIt took the Hindu community a long time to rebuild their places of worship.   Again, since priority had to be given to providing much needed homes which were   relatively small, giving birth to the dismantling of the joint family system   and the disruption of the traditional family life. To compound the problem,   religious sites in the new areas were generally purchased by the Christian churches   because they had the necessary funds. This lead to many conversions to other   faiths, especially Christianity. No adequate provision was made for the education   of the Indian child by the State, mainly because of its policy of indifference.   Through self-help and by contributions from their meagre earnings, 261 State   aided Indian schools were built by the Indian community. In this regard, the   indentured labourers went through severe hardships in the schooling of their   children, because they had to make the effort to make contributions. It is of   interest to note that three high schools, Sustri College, Verulam Secondary,   and Umzinto Secondary were built by Indian contribution and handed to the State.   All along the state aided schools suffered from inadequate funding. A small   grant per child had to cover the salaries of caretakers, telephone expenses   if any and the maintenance of the building and purchase of furniture which was   always inadequate. There were no science and library facilities during those   difficult years.\nPrior to 1984, no Indian languages, Hindi, Tamal, ...[inaudible], and Arabic   were introduced in primary schools. Even after this period, Indian languages   remained as optional subjects and are not given serious attention. They remain   as a non-examination subject and are taught in primary schools, depending on   the number. Another serious setback arose in the cultural life of the Hindu   community by the imposition of the cultural boycott by the Indian government   for almost fifty years as a result of the discriminatory laws that were passed   by parliament in this country. Hence, serious cultural deprivation occurred,   affecting the lives even to this day. A great deal of resentment and hurt lies   in the manner in which Indians were deprived access to schools which had some   of the best facilities and entry into so-called white universities. There were   many students, who at great financial sacrifice, had to study medicine and obtain   a higher education of their choice, at universities in India, Ireland and England.   If justice had prevailed, many more would have qualified locally and been added   to the list of academics holding important positions in our society. The first   university to open its doors to Indians was Fort Hare in the Cape. Dr A.D. Lazarus   became the first Indian graduate in South Africa. \nIn South Africa the majority of holidays are in conformity with Western Christianism.   All of us observe Christmas day, Easter and Sunday as a day of rest. These days   are all Christo centric. If we consider that our country is a secular one, then   every religion must have its main religious day observed side by side with others.   Alternatively, there should be only one national holiday. On the Hindu holiday   of Diwali, which falls during the months of October or November, our children   at tertiary institutions are still writing examinations on this day, which goes   against the religious spirit of Diwali. In a country with a religious majority,   minority group rights must be protected. How far do we go in attaining? As a   community we are fully in line with the principles of affirmative action. The   constitution of this country states that we are a non-racial democracy which   is to us all, is in keeping with the highest noble spirit of the land. This   spirit needs to be protected at all times and in this overall spirit of non-racial   society, concern arises in the minds of our community when one group might be   placed in favour over another. This view needs to be addressed for the future.\nEven today, we are experiencing gross human rights violations. Sadly, these   violations are being classified under the terminology of the word crime. Any   society with a high moral and ethical behaviour does not need the strong arm   of the law for the enforcement of strict penalties. On the other hand, when   the morality of individuals is so low, the laws must be firmly and strictly   applied to protect the rights of everyone. Therefore, the secular laws have   to be inversely proportional in punishment to the level of morality of individuals.   Although our human nature goes against this view, harsher forms of punishment   for serious transgressions and violations of the law are essential. Any severe   punishment in relation to the crime committed will act as a deterrent to other   offenders, than merely an appeal to the moral consciousness. We therefore need   to embark, together both from the government and from our side to conscientise   on our brothers and sisters on the negative impact that crime had on us. Therein   lies our hope for future stability. \nIn conclusion may I wish to state that we have great faith and hope in our   new found democracy. Our strength lies in the way in which we can forget and   forgive. The healing of the past undoings, which in some cases will no doubt   take time, but our strong belief in the almighty God who protects and sustains   us, will give us his guidance and mercy to overcome the challenges that lie   ahead. Although we are a nation with differing religious, cultural and ethnic   backgrounds, our commitment and love for our country and respect for all its   diversities will lead us to peace and prosperity. Let light always shine in   our hearts and may we constantly walk the path of truth. God bless the Truth   and Reconciliation Commission!",

The few who did, did so passively and not actively or for that matter   even militantly, while other Hindus who were not able to compromise their beliefs,   distanced themselves from the Hindu community leaders and in the process, from   Hindu organisations and as much as one hates at a Truth Commission Hearing to   talk about oneself, I would be unfortunately one of those, who distanced myself   from the Hindu organisations for the very same reasons. And as Hindu leaders   they, far from protesting, in many instances supported and condoned the actions   of the then ruling government. For this I must apologise on behalf of my community   because the community failed to remove these leaders when they were openly failing   to exercise their Hindu duty, forget about anything else. \nOf course there were perceptions that were created that Hindus were part of   the system and these perceptions I would like to submit, were created by the   manipulations of the then ruling order, cleverly disguised to create the impression,   so that hostility would ferment [TAPE 2]and particularly the black community   in this country. \nI would like to conclude by saying and by submitting that these people that   I have just spoken about on behalf of whom I have apologised, were a minority   few in the Hindu community.

You have, as religious people with strong religious background,   you have this belief that, you know, out there you don't really need to punish   people and put them in jail, if you can through the medium of our religious   institutions, like the churches, like the temples, like the Mosques and everything   else, instil a high moral sensitivity within them. If you do that, then we don't   have to cry to the courts and to our poor ministers who've got other problems,   insisting that they keep changing the laws every day to try and create the impression   that the government is getting tougher.

As far as reconciliation is concerned,   the Hindu community's approach is a very simple one and that's the level of   tolerance of all of us.

We wish to convey to you our deepest sympathy.\nMr Chairman, first of all, I would like to refer to the submission that we   have made in September this year, however, we have got a presentation that we   are making which is subsequent to that one, which might be slightly different   to what we have submitted. \nThe National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of South Africa, on behalf of   all the Bahais we represent, is grateful for this opportunity to share with   the Truth and Reconciliation Commission an understanding of the position and   activities of the Bahai community in South Africa during the apartheid years.   To understand the nature of the response of the Bahais to apartheid, it is necessary   to understand the character of the Bahai community, the overall aims and objectives   of the Bahai faith, its modus operandi and the global context in which it operates. \nThe Bahai faith, which is the most recent of the independent world religions,   originated in Iran in 1844. Today the Bahai faith enjoys a world-wide following   in excess of 6 million people, representing more than 2100 indigenous tribes,   races and ethical groups, residing in more than 120 000 localities, in more   than 200 countries and independent territories around the world. In South Africa,   Bahai resides in some 900 communities, although records indicates that the first   Bahais to reside in South Africa arrived in 1911. There was little significant   growth until the 1950's. During the mid-1950's, a number of Bahai families came   to this country from the United States, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and England,   to settle and to introduce the Bahai faith to South Africa. The hallmark of   the Bahai community is its diversity, a characteristic which is highly prized   and actively pursued. The essential teachings of the Bahai faith focus on unity   of God, of religion and of humanity. The pivot around which all other Bahai   teachings revolve is that of the oneness of the human race. We believe that   this is an essential reality of creation. Its acceptance and application by   the generality of the peoples of the world is not only attainable in this age,   but is the sole basis for sustainable peace and security of humanity. The very   kingdom of God on earth as promised by all the divine revelations of the past. \nBahais firmly believe that this kingdom will take the form of a global society   in which all races, creeds and classes of the world are united as a single family.   The building of this global society is not a mere outburst of ignorant emotionalism,   or an expression of a vague hope. It moves beyond awakening of the spirit of   brotherhood and goodwill among men and the fostering of harmonious co-operation   among individual peoples and cultures. This pursuit calls for an organic change   in the structures of our present day society. A change such as the world has   not yet experienced and it is towards this goal that the Bahai faith has been   working globally since its inception over 153 years ago, and in South Africa   since the 1950's. \nOur actions were and remain based on an unshakeable acceptance of the spiritual   nature of the individual and thereby the community and that religion is the   greatest of all means for the establishment of order in the world and for the   peaceful contentment of all that dwell therein. True to this teaching, our approach   has been and remains to build communities which strive to put into daily practice   fundamental spiritual aspirations such as love, honesty, moderation, humility,   hospitality, justice, morality, trustworthiness and above all, unity, thereby   influencing change from the ground up. Without the infusion of these values   into society, no community however economically prosperous or intellectually   empowered or technologically advanced can endure. Abhorring all forms of prejudice   and rejecting any system of segregation, the Bahai faith was introduced on a   one to one basis and the community quietly grew during the apartheid years,   without publicity. Despite the nature of the politics of that time, we represented   our teachings on unity and the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals   in politics, commerce and academia, and leaders of thought, including State   Presidents. \nApproaches to individuals and prominent persons were pursued in order to offer   to South Africa a pathway to peace and justice for all its citizens. During   the apartheid yeas, both individual Bahais and our administrative institutions   were continually watched by the Security Police. The surveillance and investigation   by the police was due to the racially integrated nature of the Bahai community   and its activities. However, it would appear that our numbers were too small   and our activities too peaceful to be perceived as a real threat to the government   of the day. Our activities did not include opposition to the previous government   for involvement in partisan politics and opposition to government are explicitly   prohibited by the sacred text of our faith as revealed by Bahalwa, the Prophet   founder of our faith, even should that government be suspicious and ill-disposed   to the aims and activities of the Bahais as was the case in this country. During   the time when the previous government prohibited integration with out communities,   rather than divide into separate administrative structures for each population   group, we opted to limit membership of the Bahai administration to black adherents   who were and remain in the majority of our membership and thereby place the   entire Bahai community under the stewardship of its black membership. Happily,   such policies were eased and we were able once again to have a racially integrated   administrative bodies, which were and are democratically elected by and from   the entire body of adult adherents of the Bahai faith.\nIn the nearly five decades since the Bahai faith was established in South Africa,   through strict adherence to the principles of our prophet founder, we have forged   ahead and made a modest beginning towards realising our vision of unity for   South Africa by creating a model which can be studied and scrutinised and from   which, we believe, valuable lessons can be learnt. The systematic development   of our human resources was and is a result of great emphasis and spiritual,   moral and ethical aspects of individual and community life. These include the   sanctity of the family unit, importance of rendering service to the community   in pursuit of a craft, or a profession which contributes towards prosperity   and lends momentum to the elimination of extremes of poverty and wealth, and   the obligation to educate one's children. The fundamental belief is the equality   of mean and women, stemming from our teachings on the oneness of humankind,   has meant that women in Bahai community have always taken an active role in   all aspects of the work of the faith, including national leadership positions.   The pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality have not been without its   costs. The white Bahais were often ostracised by the their white neighbours   for their association with non-whites. The black Bahais were subjected to scorn   by their black counter compatriots for their lack of political action, and their   complete integration with their white Bahai brethren. The most tragic loss to   our community was the brutal execution of four of our adherents at our places   of worship, three in Mdantsane and one in Umtata.\nAs we move towards the new millennium, our objective remains unchanged and   our vision remains undimmed. However, our sense of urgency to realise this vision   is more acute. Whatever unfolds in the years ahead in South Africa, and the   world, the Bahais will continue to endeavour to establish global and national   unity throughout the infusion of spiritual value at all levels of society by   developing unified communities throughout the land. We offer the model for establishing   peace in our country.\nAgain, we thank you for giving us this opportunity, the National Spiritual   Assembly of the Bahais of South Africa.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairperson, brothers and sisters and deal   colleagues. Firstly, I want to welcome this opportunity on behalf of the Jewish   community to participate in our faith hearings. We feel it's a wonderful opportunity   to try to heal divisions and to start the process of building a better life.   We must examine the past. We must admit failings of the past. But those failings   must prompt us all to move us in some way to do something now and in the years   ahead to build a better country for the millions of our brothers and sisters   who live in this country and who hope for a better future. One of the greatest   things which has happened in our country is that principles, values and concepts,   which are normally considered abstract have come gloriously alive in these historic   times that we're going through. The brotherhood and sisterhood of the human   family has taken on increased meaning. Everyone knows \"Simunye\", we   must try to be one. The TRC has given new meaning to wrongdoing and forgiveness.   These are not abstract ephemeral notions, but they're notions which get to the   heart of the past of our country and to the soul of its future. The inter faith   dialogue has moved beyond a mere tolerance and debate to allow us collectively   to try and create the building blocks for the future. And the most important   concept as far as the communities of this country are concerned is the concept   of sharing, which is also not an abstract religious principle. In our country   at this time, that the \"haves\" must share with the \"have-nots\"   is not merely a political, economic nor social certainty, it is a moral imperative. \nI would like to pinpoint the failings are far as the Jewish community is concerned   of all that happened in the apartheid era. The Jewish community did not initiate   apartheid. Many in the Jewish community did not agree with apartheid. Almost   everyone in the Jewish community had a kind of awkward tension about apartheid,   but most of the Jewish community benefited in one way or another from apartheid.   I want to read what Stephen Friedman, the Director of the Centre for Policy   Studies recently wrote\n\"No Jew who lived in South Africa during the apartheid period can plausibly   claim that his or her circumstances today are not in some measure a result of   apartheid. Anyone who succeeded in business, benefited from a right to economic   activity which was denied others. Anyone who received a professional qualification,   enjoyed a place at school, college, university which was denied to the majority   on racial grounds alone. Anyone who enjoyed an authentic Jewish family life,   Judaism is a domestic religion, did so in a home which persons not classified   as whites could neither own nor occupy, save as a hired servant, in which latter   case they were not permitted to enjoy a family life of their own. Any member   of our community who found a job in a corporation or as a skilled artisan, probably   occupied a post from which those classified not-white were barred\".\nThis, of course, touches only on the formal legal stipulations which enabled   the Jews along with other South Africans labelled white to get on in life at   the expense of others. Apartheid was more than a set of racial laws. Its workings   offered whites cheap labour in their homes and factories, subsidised their services   and facilities and in general provided them with every tool for personal advancement   which was denied to others. Its effect was to ensure that at least under apartheid's   latter days, few if any whites, failed to achieve a degree of affluence as a   direct result of the fact that others were forced to live in penury. This context   creates a profound personal and collective responsibility for every apartheid   reared Jew, for it raises the possibility that their attainments today may have   been achieved only because of apartheid's role in denying to others what we   now enjoy ourselves. \nHe goes on to say, and I think it's important, to anticipate an objection.   \"Yes, many Jews who made it during the apartheid era (let's get away from   the impression that all Jews are millionaires - it's not at all true. We have   meals on wheels for many old and poor Jewish people to this day). Yes, many   Jews who made it during the apartheid era would have done well in countries   which allowed equal opportunity to all.\"\nYes, many worked hard to achieve what they now have and employed much natural   ability to do it. But can we really say that all of us would be what we are   today, in the Jewish community, if apartheid had never existed? Can anyone of   us, as a matter of principle, since it is impossible to determine how South   African Judaism would have feared without apartheid, declare confidently that   we enjoy no skills, capabilities and possessions which apartheid gave us? We   bear responsibility today, whatever role we played in the past, however many   letters we wrote to the newspapers, however many bursaries we sponsored, however   civil we were to our workers or servants, because it is possible, indeed probable,   that our personal circumstances are products of apartheid. And if we are responsible   for this country's past, we are of course responsible for its future. In that   the Jewish community benefited from apartheid, apology must be given to this   commission.\nThe second question's more difficult. What did silence ...[inaudible] Very   easy - that poster \"The truth hurts and silence kills\" which is true,   but we need a sophisticated and in depth look at what happened. Now there were   many Jewish individuals who were not silent, and we have in our written submission,   we mention Professor Asmal Kadar Asmal, the current Minister of Water Affairs   and Forestry, who recently saluted the Jewish heroes of the anti-apartheid struggle.   He said the Jewish community of South Africa has produced proportionately more   heroes in the struggle against apartheid than any other so-called white group   and he went on to list a lot of names, which I won't bother to read, you've   got them there and they're all well known. It is important to indicate that   these were individuals not all of whom were practising Jewish males or females   but that they were moved by either Jewish, and more often than not, humanitarian   motivations to speak out and some of them suffered very greatly for it. But   they weren't there, and I think it's an important part of our Jewish submission   that this should not be overlooked. For example, more than half the 23 whites   involved in the treason trial of the 1950's and all five whites apprehended   in the Rivonia arrests of 1963 were Jewish. Most Jews voted for the United Party,   subsequently for the Progressive Federal Party, and eventually the Democratic   Party. Whatever might have been the reasons for the voting patterns, it's not   worthy that more than half of the 23 whites involved in the treason trial, as   mentioned, and the Rivonia trial were Jewish. \nSeeking peaceful change, Jews actually wanted to use the vote. The vote as   an individual, which unfortunately so many millions didn't have, to try to effect   change. Whatever might have been the reason for these voting patterns, clearly   in election after election, the truth is that Jews overwhelmingly and continuously   voted against the governing National Party, more so than any other white group   in South Africa. Members of the Jewish community also participated significantly   in various protest groupings such as the Five Freedoms Forum, Jews for Justice   in Cape Town, Jews for Social Justice in Johannesburg and the Black Sash. So   there were individuals and there were groups. We must explain to you, and this   is our obligation, the silence of the general Jewish community as distinct from   individuals and specific groups during the apartheid era. What does silence   denote? It denotes acquiescence and accommodation. One of the great evils of   apartheid (I know there were so many evils) was that it desensitised decent   people to the suffering of millions. They just got used to apartheid. The accommodated   themselves to it, they were acquiesce in it. Another reason could be cowardice.   [SIDE 2]must be appreciated in the Jewish context otherwise it would be   unfair. Another reason was plain fear. Apartheid was a very repressive regime,   got more and more repressive, until thank God, the democracy came. The Jewish   community is very small in numbers. It is a very silly mistake of many people   to think that there are millions and millions of Jewish people in this country.   There have never been! At its height, it was a community of 130000. At its height.   And this was a very small community and of course, it may be a very high profile   community, but it's a very small community in numbers, it's a post-holocaust   generation. Do you know what the Nazis did to the Jewish people? So therefore,   Jewish people all over the world have a sensitivity, one would say a hyper-sensitivity   towards survival. At all costs they want to survive. I am not condoning the   silence of the Jewish community in the apartheid era, I am attempting to explain   it and I am asking for your understanding. \nThere is always a fear of anti-sematism Before the Second World War, the parliament   of this country banned Jews from this country. With the Aliens Act. The Jewish   community would be very much larger now if Jews, the refugees from Europe had   been allowed in to South Africa. They weren't allowed in. Regarding the Nationalist   Party in the early days, 1940's and 50's, there was always the fear of anti-sematism,   so fear played a very great part, it shouldn't have done but it did.\nThe next point is, and I think as these are religious hearings, we should go   into it.",

            "I have to apologise, beg the commission's forgiveness   twice. Once because I don't speak English, I speak Scottish and secondly I speak   far too quickly. Okay, I'm going to go to the limit of 59 km's per hour, I'll   try not to overdo it.\nThe silence is a question of discretion. A lot of people feel that speaking   out can be dangerous and that speaking out can be futile. Now it is true to   Jewish tradition that the citizen has never been empowered to surrender the   use of his or her moral conscience. Civil disobedience has a long and honourable   tradition in Jewish history. And against the argument that it is courting danger   to challenge authority and that the exercise may well prove futile, traditional   Jewish sources suggest it's not for the protesters to judge the outcome, that   wrong must always be opposed, irrespective of the consequences. I want in this   company of religious people to quote from the Talmut in Shabbat. It says as   follows \"Rabbi Zera once said to Rabbi Simon, 'You must censure the ...[inaudible].   They've done something wrong and you have to tell them off'. He replied 'They   won't listen to me, it's a waste of time'. Rabbi Zera retorted, 'You must censure   them all the same. You have to speak out'. This accords with the view of Rabbi   Agga, who said that the good Lord himself never reversed a decision except once.   The Holy One, blessed be he, he said to the Angel Gabriel, 'Go through the city   of Jerusalem and on the foreheads of the righteous mark an X with ink and on   the foreheads of the wicked mark an X of blood and the Angel of Death is going   to move through Jerusalem and slaughter the wicked and preserver the righteous.'   Hearing that Justice became before the throne of Almighty God. 'Lord of the   universe, what are you doing? What is the difference between them?' God answered,   ' What a question is this? These are Holy righteous, and these are Holy Wicked'.   Justice replied, 'Lord of the Universe, you are not giving the righteous people   an opportunity of asking the wicked to repent'. God said to Justice, 'I know,   but even if they protested, nothing would happen, nobody's going to listen to   the Righteous, therefore they shouldn't speak out'. Said Justice to Almighty   God, 'Lord of the Universe, you know that, but did they? They should still have   spoken out'\".\nIn contradiction to this view, there is a commentary, a selection of commentators   called ...[inaudible] and they offer a cautionary note on this passage in the   Talmut, indicating that in a situation where it is quite clear that the ruling   authority will dismiss the protest out of hand, one may be justified in keeping   silent. There is no moral compunction to speak out when one's word will be brushed   aside. Indeed, the effect of protest may be to harden the transgressor in their   misdirected path and make the situation even worse. Sometimes discretion is   the better part of valour. It must be emphasised, however, that in Judaism the   normative view prevails. It is insufficient to stand apart from violations of   human rights and dissociation is inadequate where vocal protest is urgently   called for and positive steps must be taken to rectify injustice. The Jewish   sources also tell us that Job, the book of Job in the bible, that the reason   he was punished by God, was that he failed to speak out against the injustices   in his own time. So the Jewish community in South Africa, confesses a collective   failure to protest against apartheid. The situation here was not one in which   the human rights of the minority were adversely affected. That in itself would   have been wrong. It was a situation in which the human rights of the vast majority   were systematically and forcibly denied and that is a monstrous aberration.   The entire purport of Jewish moral teaching, together with the essential lesson   of Jewish historical experience as the most consistent victim among the peoples   in the world (have a look at the Jewish history) should have moved the community   to do everything possible to oppose apartheid, distancing oneself from the anguished   cry of the majority in one's own midst and myopically pursuing one's own interests,   whether personal or communal can never be morally justified. The American Jewish   philosopher, Abraham Joshua Heshel once wrote, \"Indifference to evil is   more insidious than evil itself. It is more universal, more contagious, more   dangerous. A silent justification. Indifference it makes possible an evil erupting   as an exception, becoming the accepted rule and being in turn accepted.\"   Because of the evil of indifference which so many in the Jewish community professed,   we confess that sin today before this commission and we ask forgiveness for   it. The pivotal issue of this commission is to turn the inequities of the past   towards advantage for the future. That the reason we must endeavour to understand   the feelings of the past is so that we can become fully aware of our responsibilities   now, to help repair the damage. Please God, to build a better future, not that   in spite of the past we must do better, but because of the past, we must do   better. \nIn the Jewish community, we are developing a programme called Tekun. There   has been a great deal of hot air yesterday and this morning about what ought   to be done, but there have been very few practical examples which are influencing   the grassroots, and if I may, I want to explain in a few moments the range of   practical projects the South African Jewish community is undertaking under the   broad umbrella of a programme called Tekun, which Bertie Lubner and I have the   honour of being co-chairman. Tekun is a Hebrew word meaning repairing, trying   to put things right. It is a wonderful exercise, we are trying to apply Jewish   resources, skills, expertise and know how, to be of maximum benefit to the upliftment   programme. One instance in food the Jewish housewife, when she shops, is asked   to buy an extra tin or extra packet. She is buying half a dozen tins, buy a   seventh tin. A dozen packets of something, but a thirteenth packet. That goes   in a separate part of the trolley, goes to the nearest Synagogue, some of the   Hypermarkets have actually gotcalled the ...[inaudible] and we take that   to the hungry.\nWe have many projects, I give you one instance on welfare. Nokatula, which   is a home for the physically and mentally handicapped in Alexandria Township   is consistently visited by the Selwyn Segal Centre, which is a similar home   for physically and mentally handicapped people in Johannesburg. We share expertise   and facilities and we all go together to Camp David at Magaliesberg. May I point   out that here we are not being patronising. I know it sounds terribly patronising,   we are trying to empower people to help themselves, and that's why we are handing   over the skills. We have a major agricultural project at Rietfontein. It is   an educational experience in farming, based on the success in Israel. Many of   our projects, I mention this not God forbid to make a political point! I mention   it because the state of Israel has expertise in things like water conservation,   solar energy and all forms.helping at the moment seventeen African countries,   and we feel very proud that the Israelis want to help us with some of our projects.   And they are helping us with this Agricultural Education Centre at Rietfontein.   Two weeks ago 100 000 spinach seedlings (I love spinach because it's good)spinach   gives you energy Mr Chairman! Spinach seeds were planted and we are all helping   with this exercise. We have very many educational projects. We have enrichment   programmes which SADTU and COSAS have co-operated with us. Sometimes they have   requested, sometimes we have gone to them. Our King David Schools in Johannesburg   and the schools in Cape Town are helping in the townships with computer literacy   programmes. It's where I'm computer illiterate but the youngsters, bless them,   have to be computer literate, and we're helping in East Bank High School for   example, in Alex, with many adult education programmes. Basic literacy courses.   My wife, bless her, she insists that I mention this (she's a good girl) is the   Chairperson of Ossac. Ossac is a black adult education school in Killarney,   run in the Oxford Synagogue, we get over 100 every evening. The ages range from   20 to 60. There are domestic workers, security personnel, shop assistants, unemployed   people. They do the IEB tests in English and Maths, and we have a 95% success   rate, and there is nothing more joyous in the world than seeing somebody over   50 who has been denied an education actually coming every night and studying   and the glow on that person's face when they hold their certificate, it is wondrous   to behold. We are encouraging education in many ways. Our Union of Jewish Women   has programmes in Soweto in HIPPI (home instruction for pre-primary youngsters   which is geared to the mothers) and MATAL (upgrading the qualifications of pre-school   teachers). \nThere was, many years ago in Israel, an Afro-Asian institute which actually   taught very many in the trace union movement. Very many years ago. Some of the   things I mentioning to you have been going on for donkey's years. The Rabbi   Wyler's School in Alexandria was founded by the Reformed Jewish Movement over   50 years ago. Rabbi Wyler put in a primary school then and thank God it's still   going. We have arranged to take groups of young professionals to Israel to train   them in entrepreneurial skills, business development skills, banking skills.   We are already on our fourth group there. Every single person who has been in   one of these groups and come back, they have actually been given promotion.   If they were a bank clerk, they are now assistant manager in the bank. And it's   a wonderful thing.\nWe are using the expertise of ORT which is an international Jewish organisation   and we have at Midrand a college of Science and Technology, which is again wonderfully   successful. We are doing things for employment and there is a very wonderful   lady called Helen Leverman, in the Cape, who does .la Bantu, it's making   toys and bead decorations and they are sold all over the world, in Paris, London   and New York. And it's a way of getting, including blind people, who can be   taught how to string the beads and by the touch on a colour system, and it's   a marvellous thing. We have sporting activities, Makabe goes in, and we have   soccer in Soweto and they love it. And we have cultural activities. We have   joint choral concerts. We have the black choir of Soweto, the Johannesburg Jewish   Choir and something called the Welsh Male Choir. We are trying to build bridges,   we are going across the board. \nI have only given you, Mr Chairperson, dear, dear friend, I have only given   you a few examples. I know it's a drop in the ocean, but we are trying to galvanise   our Jewish community in order that we can actually help. It is our responsibility   to be of help.\nFinally, I want to say this. It's our job as religious people, if I may be   bold to say so, it is the job of all of us to try to apply the antidotes. This   TRC has become famous throughout the world because of the horror which has unfolded   in testimony so many months before you. There is no-one who has listened in   the radio, or who very humbly has come to sit at the back and listen to the   testimony, there is no-one that hasn't been moved to tears, because we have   had here a record of inhumanity. The worst things that human beings can do to   other human beings and what we need in our country is to now change because   of that. To change to the best, to display the best that human beings can do   to fellow human beings. Not the hurt and the torture and the shame, but the   love and the friendship and the mutual help to lift our country up. If apartheid   was divisive, the antidote is building bridges and coming together. A togetherness   which will spell the great future of our country. I want to finish by quoting   Abraham Joshua Hershell once again. He said an incredibly beautiful thing about   mission. \nHe said \"We all carry within our souls the gold to forge the gates of   the kingdom\". That's an incredibly beautiful statement to make, that God   has blessed each of us, deep within us with the gold to fashion out and to make   the gates of the kingdom. If we, together, all of us, all religious groups who   are so meaningful in this country and have such an impact at the grassroots,   if we can dig deep within ourselves for the gold of goodness within us, and   we can make those gates and we can go through them, then we will have in our   beloved country of South Africa, please God, a bright and wonderful future.",

            "Thank you Rabbi for your submission, especially the last paragraphs   on the future, the contributions made by the Jewish community struck me.\nI want to ask you a question, I raised it also with the Anglican Church yesterday.   Is it your experience that by and large your congregants, the Jewish people   going to Synagogue have difficulty in really owning the TRC process? Are they   denying, are they at war with the results of the TRC? Or do you succeed in helping   them to really own the process? What can we do to help the by and large the   white community to say, but this in spite of how painful the disclosures are,   this is our process?",

            "That too is a very fair and appropriate question.   There's a generation gap in the Jewish community, as there is in most white   communities. Old people got so used to apartheid, immune to it, that many of   them still don't realise that thank God we now have a non-racial democracy,   we have a black majority government in place. The youngsters are the opposite.   The younger generation is very into the New South Africa, very cognisant of   the necessity of the process. So I have to answer you that there is a dichotomy.   We do have difficulty with many things, including the TRC, with those who are   over the age of 60. We have no difficulty with those who are under the age of   30. We have some difficulties in the middle group. We are trying very much.   The only specific complaint which has been aired about the TRC has to do with   amnesty. There are a lot of people who feel that the relatives of victims, when   they cry out to you for justice, that there may be, you know the ten commandments   are absolutely categoric on \"Thou shalt do this, and thou shalt not do   that\". All religions based on morality have a doctrine of reward and punishment.   There is a line beyond which we are not allowed to go. How dare we treat fellow   human beings in such a way, and therefore the one clear criticism that I have   heard from quite a number of Jewish people is that they can empathise fully   with those who have been complaining that the amnesty is too extensive. It is   appreciated that the TRC may not have come into being at all, God forbid, if   a deal hadn't been done on all sides regarding amnesty. But it is nevertheless   true that while God is a God of forgiveness, there are certain things which   are unforgivable, including some of the things that we have heard about. And   that is one of the criticisms I have heard. By and large, the TRC is accepted,   it's hearings have are followed. They are followed avidly. You may not have   hundreds and thousands of people coming to them. But a lot of people listen   on radio, a lot of people do look in at the television summaries and it is being   followed with a great deal of interest.",

I think   that we have come to realise that apartheid was much more than an idiosyncratic   political system, and the brutality that has been exposed now is very much approximate   to the brutality that our ancestors have experienced in the past. But I think   that that sense of shame has only deepened the commitment that many of my generation   feel to try and heal the wounds of the past.",

            "I must here submit the truth that I tried my best to scrape the   bottom of the barrel in search of the drops of my guilt by my goals, not me   as an individual but in a collective single plurality and I failed to find one   in the course of the struggle. This puts me to a point where I say, we can remark   that the guilt of the oppressor and the oppressed shall never be the same and   shall never be faced from the same angle, for they are operating on different   levels and therefore the structuring of forums where the two sectors can express   themselves sometimes needs to be reconsidered.\nHere, when I was coming to this forum here, at the airport, a little girl who   was serving me with the ticket at about 5 'o clock in the morning because I   came very early. She was serving me and a white man who was standing in front   of me and we were following each other. Then while she was serving, she remarks   to me, \"Can't you stand in the queue?\" and I looked, and there was   nobody, I was the last in the queue, because people had not arrived. Simply   she meant couldn't I go to the end where everybody stands, instead of going   nearer. I examined myself, I said what's wrong? I actually smelled my armpits   and though that I had forgotten to put on the deodorant! But truly I had. I   didn't forget. The white man in front of me said to her \"What is the difference?\"   and I smiled and though the cheek of it is that I am not just going to a forum   to plead her cause, I am actually flying to that forum in order to plead her   cause and bring about reconciliation. The only note that went deeper than I   had thought is that she does not see me or categorise me as an integral part   of her humanity. They I deserve her respect. She is a remnant of the apartheid   mentality that breeds falsehoods in the human society, the falsehoods of superiority   and inferiority and that man did not belong to the same category.\nHere Chairman, let me remark that for the last 500 years, the black community,   African people in particular, have been subjected or have been fully engaged   in a programme of self defence and self preservation, guarding themselves and   their children against Europe's rape and this meaning that is Europe's encroachment   and violation of Africa's territorial sovereignty, cultural value systems, political   freedoms and autonomy, economic development, religious, philosophical thought   and ethics. Africa has been fully engaged in that category. And while engaged   in this category, Africa's genius that once created civilisations and cultures   was destroyed, numbed or frozen to nothingness.\nChairman, let me just say again, the process of Africa's advancement was folded.   Then we got all us engaged from sanctuaries in this battle of liberation. There   could be some errors and omissions but not as agreed upon from institutions,   but out of sheer human frailty. That's where I said I failed to find my guilt   and in the omissions of fully being engaged in the struggle for liberation.   Let me point out that apartheid is not in any manner a recent product, but it   is a continuity of eurocentric thinking that culminated in the murderous barbarous   acts that were committed on the African people, in particular on the Southern   parts of Africa. By so saying, this continuity, started on the very, in the   14th century, when the Italian sects laid out a doctrine where they said being   without form and nature, that is man is nothing but matter without form, and   being without form and nature, man is not constrained, feted or determined to   any particular destiny by an alien supernatural power. In this way, his distinctive   characteristic becomes his freedom. He is free to make himself in the image   of God or in the image of beast. This was said by the Italian humanists and   I, as an African adhering to an African source, if I fail to correct that hierarchy   then my Lord, I am guilty. And I, if as an African, if I did not argue my point   of the internalisation of God in the human activity, at that moment, then I   am guilty. Because that gave power to the apartheid protagonists, who had a   freedom of choice. Either to carry themselves and manifest the image of God   and his likeness in us. They had a choice and thus they chose the way of the   beast. That we are suffering from now.\nWhat is our point at this stage of speaking? I can say, brothers and sisters,   we are unfortunately at this moment of our living that we are living in a time   of cultural disarray and moral decay. Sound social cultural ethical and spiritual   values have been destroyed by the evangelised policies of apartheid without   any replacement. As a result, we find ourselves ushered into an age filled with   the ruins and fragments of morality. Hence our intellectual landscapes are littered   with ...[indistinct] tales of deterioration in human relations, rather thank   dramatic narratives of humanness, reconciliation, justice and peace. This reality   has been brought out to us clearly in the deliberations of the Truth and Reconciliation   Commission. The most inhuman institutions and ideological hierarchies ever recorded   in the pages of human history are nothing but slavery, Nazism, apartheid and   others that to state here would make the list rather too long. [TAPE 3] ...[inaudible]   Apartheid should not be seen in isolation, but must be seen as a final product   of the Eurocentric spiritual thinking and faith that separated divinity from   man. And therefore it could not have taken any other path \nWe are here today to look at the actual living products, we are here to look   at the protagonists of Nazism and fascism, the rapists and murderers of Bosnia,   the genocists of Ruanda, and the epitomes of apartheid in South Africa, these   including the third force gangsters who terrorised, maimed and slaughtered thousands   of innocent train commuters in Soweto and other places. In those who raped women   and killed innocent children, all these including the Gestapo murder squads   of Vlakplaas, the Mamaselas, De Kocks, Coetzees and those of the killing fields   of Natal. Including all that, we find that all of them \"hulle is sonder   menswaardigheid\". They do not have a humanness, Ubuntu, that is the problem.   Now this immediately takes me into the second part of our question what did   we do in the face of what was going on? Did we become conformists or collaborators?   What are we to do in the face or in the light of the information that has been   brought to us by the TRC? What contribution can we make to right the wrongs   and bring about a meaningful transformation of our beloved democratic South   Africa? What are our objectives and plans - practical to avoid future recurrence   of these historic tragedies? Are we to play the fiddle while Rome is burning?   Or are we to stand shivering like a hypnotised rabbit before the python of apartheid?   What are we going to do? That is the question. What practical things are we   to do? From my tradition of faith and culture I cannot have the freedom of choice   and this is based on the concept of communalism that I subscribe to. It is almost   impossible for me to isolate or distance myself from the suffering of the human   society. We have a very good saying that was written by ...[inaudible] \"When   you bleed, my handkerchief is full of thy blood, when you twitch with pain,   I feel the sting in my loins for you and me, dear black brother, are but one.\"   That sums up our involvement. There is no way that we could not have been involved.   We believe here in the commonness of humanity that we all share, we believe   in the validity of the human person, we subscribe to the concept that we are   all an integral part of each other, we hold onto the philosophical concept of   the other for our being in the world presupposes the existence of the other.   We are therefore sharing the commonness and the intertwines of aspirations,   interests and objectives, purpose and hope. Thus the suffering of one unit of   the whole affects me for I am because you are and you are because I am. \nThis puts me into now the final phase, the philosophy that we come to think   that it is inevitable for this country to resort to that philosophy. Let us   not forget this very vital point that the TRC is founded on the universal concept   of truth, justice, prudence and righteousness. These are in turn attributes   of the philosophical concept of Ubuntu, which is a modality of the divine spirit.   Here we find that we are to carry this philosophy into the next century and   centuries to come. Let me say in short after the war, the two Germanys were   divided, I mean Germany was divided into two. A wall was built, and now a wall   has been broken. For the communist Germany to mix with the capitalist Germany,   they are enjoying the same economic resources, but recently it was published   that the mixing does not work. They can not just go on smoothly, as envisaged.   Why? Let us note here that Germany, the citizens of Germany, they need a philosophy,   a philosophy that they can all subscribe to. A philosophy that can be touching   to the Jew, to the German, to the Hindu, to the Moslem, the black and white,   a philosophy that is making us to start to recognise each other as an integral   part of each other and not just to harmonise. I can harmonise with my dog, it   can lick my lips, it can jump and caress, but the fact is that I am not an integral   part of a dog, it is still a dog and therefore we need a philosophy that can   bring us together.\nThis is the philosophy my Lord that I wish to present at this moment in short.   It is a philosophy that comes from my faith that on the day of the creation   when the spirit of the Lord moved over the waters, it disseminated the waters   and disseminated a consciousness in the waters and there was life. And the same   spirit came up when God created man when he said let us make man in our own   image and likeness, he modelled him from the slime of the earth, from the dust   of the earth, and made a statue and what did he do? He breathed into the nostrils   and as soon as that breath entered the nostrils, man became a living soul..   Therefore he shared something, something in common with God, for he carried   the God head in him. And which is when we asked is a human, is a person there   a human man, a statue, a mud, a slime of the earth but as soon as God came \"ntu\"   in our language, that \"ntu\" meaning God and which is you would say   Jehovah, the same as you would say Nata in Egyptian, the same as you would say   in all the various languages.",

We take out our cars and we hold a   congregation in the garage. This is the type of people we work with. \nOur gratitude mostly goes to the SACC without them we would not have been able   to get anywhere. We used to be beaten up. We would gather as a congregation   and we would be beaten up. We were labelled communists. We would be labelled   all sorts of names that I cannot use today, because we no longer use such names.   It was very difficult. It was hard. They tell us this is not a church. Until   our own people who were members of other churches would look down at us and   talk terribly. Lastly, we ask for forgiveness for not having fought in the struggle,   for not having been beaten up, detained and killed. Fight with the flesh and   not the bible. We should have stood up for our people. We are cowards and we   admit it. We are cowards because we did not stand up and fight.

We referred to their funerals as political funerals, therefore   I was not allowed to go to those funerals.\nI thank the parties that sheltered us, SACC, ICT, SABC and also the Anglican   Church has always been there for us.

            "I would like to thank the Chairperson for the opportunity   that is offered to us as CAIC to make our own first time presentation in 100   years. I say in 100 years because actually the church I am about to speak about   is 100 years old. This church was first founded by Reverend ...[inaudible],   Reverend James Dwane, Reverend Mkoni, in the process Reverend Shembe and Reverend   Engenas Lekganyane. \nI am very disturbed because some of our living ancestors that I - because of   the contact that we have with the TRC, we were hoping that they would be here   in our presentation. My Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane and thanks that he had arrived,   so I have heard from the report, and Bishop Modise, because in fact these two   churches to us, they are a church that was founded 100 years ago. The founders   of this movement of CAIC was not to divide Africans, it was to unite Africans.   It was to unite Africans as a church in ecumenism, it was to unite Africans   as faith in the inter faith. And now that we make our presentation in the absence   of the two we feel the opportunity has not been quite positive, but we are happy   that they are able to come.\nActually, our vision within the broader ecumenical family of churches has been   citing the absence of ZCC and the IPC and other churches that are not participating   in the household of one church in this country. And I'm glad that the moment   had come that this issue be tackled as it is. The Council of African Instituted   Churches was formed in 1976 and thanks to the Chairperson of the TRC, Archbishop   Desmond Mbilo Tutu, and Doctor Dominee Beyers Naude, and several others that   were there to help to bring together the independent churches. We are the former   Council of African Independent Churches that actually was able to change from   independent rather as a council but opted for the word \"Instituted\"   as one church of God with the other churches. We don't see relevance in being   independent in the changing South Africa and the challenges of the changing   world. The presentation that we would want to make in a formal way is definitely   going to be faxed or sent to the TRC. We would want our presentation, our submission,   to be made on record with the others, but from what we have, we are proud to   say that we speak as victims. We speak as victims of apartheid. As a church,   we are thankful for the elections of 1994 because actually the elections of   1994 covered the whole kind of nightmares that we as Africans had in this country,   that were caused to us by the Afrikaner colonials. It is only twenty or less   percent, that the religion is to tackle, and that is to come together. We need   to come together and face the socio-economic religion and political matters   of this country and together we will make it.\nI am not going to dwell too much on what we would want to put forward as prejudices   and injustices that were done to us. Much as was our President in prison and   other colleagues, initiatives of an African were all at halt. Those which managed   to get through either were puppetry somehow or other, but everything came to   a standstill once we were inwe tried throughout the year, but those who   were not legitimate and proper initiatives that a black person had to take and   thanks to these actions, now that we are able as group of small churches under   the bridges of our country, under the trees of our country in the diningrooms,   in the sitting rooms, everywhere where a black person would find a shelter to   bring together a number of people to worship. We are able to speak as one sitting   together and calling on other brothers that according to us, are the \"haves\"   we need to club together with them and prepare a motion and to prepare a council   that will be able to speak for the independent churches. The Deputy State President   has introduced to the nation a concept of African Renaissance. And we are for   it and also say to ourselves that it is time that we as a church, we must begin   to start up programmes for South African Renaissance. To be able to work together   and move forward to the whole continent. We believe that it is time that the   independent church, I refer to independent for other people to really know where   we come from. Actually we remain instituted churches, it is time for us for   these churches to send missionaries to Africa. Missionaries to the world. When   are we going to begin if we are unable to work together and build a strong fellowship   on ourselves that will be able to relate to matters that trouble an ordinary   human being. We are unable to address matters that are very, very hard pressing   individuals and ordinary people. Homelessness, we can't speak as a church about   homelessness, because it is our people who are homeless and we are unable to   come together and utilise resources and address those matters, so I will repeatedly   say that we certainly were the victims. We were the victims of forced removals,   of imprisonment, of massacres, of rapes on black women, of denials of basic   education. You name them all, we in my President's words, are able to say, sorry   to those - to a lesser degree, to a much more degree, atrocities were done to   us. We should be a forum that people come to us and apologise to us. But indeed,   together in the fellowship we have accept and welcome that people should come   forward and tell the world what they did to Africans. Those injustices were   done to us. I am not going to take too much time, Chairperson, I am calling   on for these big churches and saying to them, \"Come, let us work as one\".   As we approach the next millennium. My last word would be once people start   talking to each other, misconceptions are eradicated and better friendships   are forged. Thank you.",

Some of the churches   that emanated from the white church, some of us were actually chased away from   the white church saying that they could not go on in the way that they did.   Some were working under white priests who had immigrated into South Africa.   They would collect money from the black congregation and they would take this   money from the black congregation and give it to the white people and the black   man would not get anything. \nNgwenya realised that he must be independent. He then started his own church.   However, most of us black people were referred to as heathens. Our people said   they would be independent and do their own thing at the side.",

Now that you were   successful in leaving the white churches because of the oppression that you   experienced, I would like to know is there something substantial that you are   doing in your churches now that reflects the fact that you realised that you   were oppressed.

If you go to the depths of Soweto even a cat will tell you where Ntongana's   house is, because I wanted these people to come and fetch me, even though I   was scared for my family, I wanted to stand up and these people to come and   fetch me. If you read the New Nation in 1985 or 86, I wrote an article there.   It was in English. I said \"If Jesus Christ was here on earth today, he   would be in prison.\" I have this article at home. I am part of the community.   I stand for the community. Nothing goes on in Soweto without my knowledge. There   is only one thing that our churches cannot handle. Our Bishops do not want to   raise funds. They want ready money for themselves, they want other people to   raise money and they enjoy that money. If you don't raise funds, how are you   going to enjoy money, you'll be stealing other people's efforts. I have answered   you.\ngo to PART 2",
