We have to apologise for having kept you for the best part of the day but as in any, and I'm sure you have been to inquries of this nature, sometimes time logistics is not always a manageable commodity.\n Without further ado, let me introduce the members of the panel.  Commissioner Glenda Wildschut is a Commissioner in the Rehabilitations and Reparations Committee.  I am a Commissioner in the Human Rights Violations Committee and Wilson Magadla to my right is head of Special Investigations in the Commission.  To our right we have the person who has been investigating this case, Chrystelle Terreblanche and with her is Doctor David Klatzow who is contracted to the Commission on a consulting basis.\n Evidence led here is of a confidential nature.  It is not for public consumption.  It is taken in camera, precisely because it is intended to be of an investigative nature.  It's an inquiry seeking to probe but we do it under oath in terms of the Act, so that the evidence that we take is evidence by any legal yardstick.  \n Whatever you say here you commit yourself to a version under oath and what is more, it is not the sort of evidence that is going to be used by us in the panel in order for us to arrive at any finding because it is not a trial, it is not a hearing, it is not a disciplinary inquiry, it's is an investigative probe which is why therefore, only people who are in the Commission and people who are contracted by the Commission and those who have come to depose to statements that they have or to lead evidence are permitted and are here.\n Before you testify I will ask Commissioner Wildschut to swear you in, which is what I'm asking her now to do.",

            "There were two tapes, the one you gave DCA, which is why they returned it to say, look there's nothing on this tape, it was because it was not the tape in issue.  If you want to place that in contest, if you are contesting that, then maybe do so as you answer questions that are being put to you.  I think there are two propositions now, when you continue to say the tape was returned and it was returned by DCA on the basis that it contained nothing, he is in the in the clause of putting questions to you, saying it was the wrong tape which is why it was being returned to you, and that is why the tape that was in issue became an issue because people then began to say, look you have given us a wrong tape because it is not relevant to the day in question, give us the correct tape, and then was the occasion for you to say, by the way that tape has been run over.  That's where the controversies has lied all along, but then let's take it step by step, Dr Klatzow, I don't want to break your trend of trying to build up to whatever points you want to build up, but I just wanted to say to Mr Mitchell, maybe you should give yourself time to listen what he's asking, and not anticipate where he's trying to get to because once you begin to anticipate you'll find that you are answering questions that are anticipated and the you reply to questions that have not been put.  And I think what is troubling you is that you preceded in the whole enquiry by proposing a theory that says there was an open decision, because on the basis of what - of the experience that you are talking about.  Disabuse your mind for the moment of anything that you have ...(indistinct) of a type of theory and try and see if, you know, in the course of, you know, a controlled conversation of this nature, you are going to be able to concede or still take the views that put, but don't anticipate questions.",

It is not far- fetched, it may, in 1998, appear to be far-fetched for a suggestion to be made that a Judge could have made a proposition of that nature, but when you take into account what happened in this country, when evidence was placed by an advocate of a Senior Counsel, for instance in the case of the Harms Commission, before the Harms Commission, evidence that was placed over a long period - against the bedrock of public confessions that had been made by certain individuals about the prevalence of hit squads, evidence which was rejected as being false, but which has not been proved in every single event by the perpetrators coming forward, and many others, to show that it was not just an act of a few bad applies, it was a prevalence, the nature of which we deal in this particular chamber, day in and day out in an expression by way of amnesty applications.  So those sort of things are not far-fetched, and that a Judge could have make a proposition like that is not fare-fetched, and it is our experience from what has been put before us in the course of this enquiry that people were frightened then, and still are frightened now because of the sort of environment that was created by suggestions which, it is our view, made by this Judge that it is not in the national interest for certain information to be made available for that Commission.\n So, it is absolutely and critically important that you should endeavour to recall why it was that you went to see Judge Margo at his house, at his invitation, at a crucial time when the presiding officer should have stayed away from private conversations of any nature whatsoever which involves people who were potentially witnesses before you.",

What I wanted to clarify is that the basis, and I'll try and make it a simple straight sentence without repeating myself.\n The purpose of the big discussion on the tapes is based on the fact that there was communication between the aeroplane and ZUR.  Now in the evidence the people who were there before, the Mr Dick and Mr Naude, they stood up for the system and said it's a wonderful radio system and it's in actually fact a very relevant system.  You could to ZUR all the time.  Well, in actual fact they were wrong.  They gave wrong evidence to the Court, they were incorrect.  And the point that I make is right.  Now why I brought that evidence from this last flight and also in addition to this, when Mauritius radio called ZUR 3 times x four frequencies the following day and didn't get them, the point I'm making about it is that HF Communications is not a telephone.  That is the first thing.  The probability we had over six hours no contact a matter of a week ago, and this is just an example because it happens every second night.  It's not every night, it depends on the ...[indistinct] sphere and I've brought documents to give to the Commission to show that the base line of saying that communications did take place Sir, it did not take place.  If they did transmit there it skipped distance over the top, on top of the world, through the ...[indistinct] sphere and there was none there.  Doctor Klatzow is a scientist and I'm very happy to give him all these documents.  I've got documents from Aikaho, from Iata, from Afri Region, the whole lot of them, to show that HF radio is not a good means of communication.  So the simplest assumption that you can say, I spoke to ZUR or was suggested by a lady who came to see me in Mauritius, she said: \"You telephoned\", I said: \"No, Madam it's not a telephone, you're lucky if you get it\", so ...[intervention]",
